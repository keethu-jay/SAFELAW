Attorney, Pittsburgh, PA, for Appellant.

Before: FISHER, VANASKIE and ROTH, Circuit Judges.
OPINION OF THE COURT
FISHER, Circuit Judge.
The Government appeals from the order of the District Court
dismissing the indictment against Melissa Huet ("Huet") with
prejudice. Huet was charged with aiding and abetting possession
of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922 (g)(1) and § 2 . The District Court dismissed the
indictment on the basis that: (1) it failed to state an offense
for aiding and abetting under § 922(g)(1) and § 2 ; and
(2) even if it did state an offense, the charge violated Huet's
rights under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution . For
the reasons set forth below, we will reverse and remand.
I.
On June 5, 2008, a federal grand jury sitting in the Western
District of Pennsylvania returned a three-count indictment
against Huet and her paramour, Marvin Hall ("Hall"). Counts One
and Two, respectively, charged Hall with possession of a
firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922 (g)(1), and transfer of unregistered firearms, in violation
of 26 U.S.C. § 5861 (e). Count Three ("Count Three" or "the
Indictment") charged Huet with knowingly aiding and abetting
the possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation
of 18 U.S.C. § 922 (g)(1) [fn1] and § 2(a) . [fn2] On
January 29, 2010, Hall pled guilty to Count One, and was
sentenced to time served. On November 22, 2010, the District
Court issued an order dismissing Count Three with prejudice.
The Government filed a timely notice of appeal.
The allegations in the Indictment stem from an undercover FBI
investigation into the activities of Morgan Jones ("Jones") in
Clarion County, Pennsylvania. The investigation focused on
attempts to purchase illegal firearms and explosive devices for
criminal activities, as well as the potential manufacturing and
detonation of explosive devices. During their probe, FBI agents
met Hall and Huet, who lived together. Over the next nine
months, agents gathered evidence allegedly connecting Hall and
Huet to various criminal activities, and on June 6, 2008, a
valid search warrant (the "search warrant") was executed on the
couple's Clarion County home. Agents [*593] seized an SKS, Interordinance M59/66 rifle ("SKS rifle")
from an upstairs bedroom.
Although Huet is legally permitted to possess a firearm, Hall
was convicted in 1999 of possessing an unregistered firearm, in
violation of 26 U.S.C. § 5861 (d), and is therefore
prohibited from owning or [**2] possessing a firearm. After being
informed of the raid, Huet allegedly told investigators that
the guns in the house belonged to her and that it was not
illegal for her to purchase weapons. Despite Huet's assertions
that she alone possessed the SKS rifle, the Government sought
and obtained an indictment charging Hall with illegal
possession of the weapon, and Huet with aiding and abetting
Hall's possession.
Huet moved to dismiss Count Three pursuant to Rule 12 (b)(3)(B)
of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [fn3] on the basis
that the Indictment failed to state an offense under § 922(g)(1) and § 2 . Count Three states:
From on or about August 10, 2007, to on or about
  January 11, 2008, in the Western District of
  Pennsylvania, the defendant, Melissa A. Huet,
  knowingly and unlawfully aided and abetted the
  possession of a firearm, that is an SKS assault rifle,
  in and affecting interstate commerce, by Marvin E:
  Hall, who had previously been convicted on or about
  March 12, 1999, in the United States District Court
  for the Western District of Pennsylvania . . . of the
  crime of Possession of Unregistered Firearms, an
  offense which is punishable by a term of imprisonment
  in excess of one year. In violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 922 (g)(1) and 2 .
In granting Huet's Rule 12 motion, the District Court stated
that "notably absent from the Indictment . . . [were] any facts
setting forth how defendant Huet aided and abetted
defendant Hall in his unlawful possession of the SKS rifle." United States v. Huet , No. 08-0215 , [ 2010 BL 276121 ], 2010 WL 4853847,
at *5 (W.D.Pa. Nov. 22, 2010). The District Court did not limit
its inquiry to the four corners of the Indictment, however, and
examined additional information to discern the Government's
theory of the case. The District Court looked to materials
produced pursuant to Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, as well as record evidence from Hall's case.
Specifically, the Court relied upon statements set forth in the
affidavit of probable cause supporting the search warrant, [fn4] and remarks made by the prosecutor during Hall's guilty plea
hearing. [fn5] Concluding that this evidence failed to establish
any connection between Huet's actions and Hall's possession,
the District Court granted Huet's Rule 12 motion to dismiss for
failure to state an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 922 (g)(1) and
§ 2 . Huet , [ 2010 BL 276121 ], 2010 WL 4853847, at *7. [*594]
The District Court's view of the Government's theory of the
case similarly guided its approach to Huet's Second Amendment challenge. Huet argued that even if Count Three did state an
offense for aiding and abetting a felon in possession, under
the factual scenario presented in this case, the charge
violated her rights under the Second Amendment . The District
Court agreed, finding that "to permit [the] Indictment to go
forward . . . would be [to] countenanc[e] the total elimination
of the right of a sane, non-felonious citizen to possess a
firearm, in her home, simply because her paramour is a felon." Id . at *11. "[T]o punish Huet, who has not been
convicted of a felony . . . as a principal, violates the core
of the Second Amendment right to keep arms," the Court opined,
because the conduct alleged to have aided and abetted was
"purely possessory." Id . at *7; see id . at
*11 (characterizing Government's case as an attempt to
"compound[] an inchoate [**3] offense upon another inchoate
offense"). Although the District Court did not explicitly
designate the Second Amendment violation as an alternative
basis for dismissal, it clearly viewed it as such. Accordingly,
we must address both the sufficiency of the Indictment and the Second Amendment challenge.
II.
The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3231 . We have jurisdiction over the District Court's order
dismissing the Indictment under 18 U.S.C. § 3731 . "[W]hen
reviewing a motion to dismiss an indictment, our standard of
review is mixed." United States v. Shenandoah , 595 F.3d 151 , 156 (3d Cir. 2010) (citations omitted). We exercise
plenary review over the District Court's legal conclusions and
review any challenges to its factual findings for clear error. Id . Here, the primary question is not whether the
District Court's findings of fact were erroneous, but whether
the District Court was entitled to find and weigh facts at all.
This is a legal question, over which we exercise plenary
review. Id . We also exercise plenary review over a
constitutional challenge to the application of a statute. United States v. Marzzarella , 614 F.3d 85 , 88 n. 2 (3d
Cir. 2010) (citing United States v. Fullmer , 584 F.3d 132 , 151 (3d Cir. 2009)).
III.
A.
We first address the Government's contention that the District
Court erred in concluding that, under Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 12 (b)(3)(B), Count Three failed to state an offense
for aiding and abetting a felon in possession of a firearm
under 18 U.S.C. § 922 (g)(1) and § 2 .
1.
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7 (c)(1) requires only that
an indictment "be a plain, concise, and definite written
statement of the essential facts constituting the offense
charged." "[T]he Federal Rules "were designed to eliminate
technicalities in criminal pleadings and are to be construed to
secure simplicity in procedure.'" United States v. Resendiz-Ponce , 549 U.S. 102 , 110 , 127 S.Ct. 782 , 166 L.Ed.2d 591 (2007) (quoting United States v. Debrow , 346 U.S. 374 , 376 , 74 S.Ct. 113 , 98 L.Ed. 92 (1953)). Although
detailed allegations may have been required under a common law
pleading regime, they "surely are not contemplated by [the
Federal Rules]." Id .
"It is well-established that `[a]n indictment returned by a
legally constituted and unbiased grand jury, . . . if valid [*595] on its face , is enough to call for trial of the
charge on the merits.'" United States v. Vitillo , 490 F.3d 314 , 320 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting Costello v. United States , 350 U.S. 359 , 363 , 76 S.Ct. 406 , 100 L.Ed. 397 (1956)). We have held that an indictment is facially sufficient
if it "(1) contains the elements of the offense intended to be
charged, (2) sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he
must be prepared to meet, and (3) allows the defendant to show
with accuracy to what extent he may plead a former acquittal or
conviction in the event of a subsequent prosecution." Id. at 321 (citation omitted). "[N]o greater
specificity than the statutory language is required so long as
there is sufficient factual orientation" to permit a defendant
to prepare his defense and invoke double jeopardy. United States v. Kemp , 500 F.3d 257 , 280 (3d Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Rankin , 870 F.2d 109 , 112 (3d
Cir. 1989)). Generally, an indictment will satisfy these
requirements where it informs the defendant of the statute he
is charged with violating, lists the elements of a violation
under the statute, and specifies the time period during which
the violations occurred. [**4] United States v. Urban , 404 F.3d 754 , 771 (3d Cir. 2005); see also United States v. McCarty , 862 F.2d 143 , 144 , 148 (7th Cir. 1988) (finding
indictment under 18 U.S.C. § 922 (g) sufficient where it
tracked the statutory language, stated the date and place of
the alleged possession, and specifically identified the type of
firearm involved). In contrast, if an indictment fails to
charge an essential element of the crime, it fails to state an
offense. United States v. Wander , 601 F.2d 1251 , 1259 (3d Cir. 1979).
In determining whether an indictment validly states the
elements of the offense, we need not blindly accept a
recitation in general terms of the elements of the offense. United States v. Panarella , 277 F.3d 678 , 685 (3d Cir.
2002). "Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12 (b)(3)(B) allows a
district court to review the sufficiency of the government's
pleadings to . . . ensur[e] that legally deficient charges do
not go to a jury." United States v. Bergrin , 650 F.3d 257 , 268 (3d Cir. 2011). Although the Government is not required
to set forth its entire case in the indictment, "if the
specific facts" that are alleged "fall beyond the scope of the
relevant criminal statute, as a matter of statutory
interpretation," the indictment fails to state an offense. Panarella , 277 F.3d at 685 ; see United States v. Schiff , 602 F.3d 152 , 162-66 (3d Cir. 2010) (finding that
indictment alleging "failure to rectify misstatements of
others" did not, as a matter of statutory interpretation, state
an offense under 15 U.S.C. § 78j (b) and SEC Rule 10b-5 ).
However, the scope of a district court's review at the Rule 12
stage is limited. "[A] pretrial motion to dismiss an indictment
is not a permissible vehicle for addressing the sufficiency of
the government's evidence." United States v. DeLaurentis , 230 F.3d 659 , 660 (3d Cir. 2000) (citations
omitted). "The government is entitled to marshal and present
its evidence at trial, and have its sufficiency tested by a
motion for acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal
Procedure 29 ." Id. at 661 . There is no criminal
corollary to the civil summary judgment mechanism. Id . In evaluating a Rule 12 motion to dismiss, a district court
must accept as true the factual allegations set forth in the
indictment. United States v. Sampson , 371 U.S. 75 , 78-79 , 83 S.Ct. 173 , 9 L.Ed.2d 136 (1962); United States v. Besmajian , 910 F.2d 1153 , 1154 (3d Cir. 1990). "Evidentiary
questions-such as credibility determinations and the weighing
of proof — should not be determined at this stage." Bergrin , 650 F.3d at 265 (internal marks and citation
omitted). Thus, a district court's review of [*596] the facts set forth in the indictment is limited to
determining whether, assuming all of those facts as true, a
jury could find that the defendant committed the offense for
which he was charged. Panarella , 277 F.3d at 685 ; DeLaurentis , 230 F.3d at 660 .
2.
To survive Huet's motion to dismiss, the Government was
required to adequately set forth the elements of aiding and
abetting a felon in possession under 18 U.S.C. § 922 (g)(1)
and § 2 . To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2 , the
government must prove: "(1) that the substantive crime has been
committed; and (2) that the defendant charged with aiding and
abetting knew of the commission of the substantive offense and
acted with intent to facilitate it." United States v. Petersen , 622 F.3d 196 , 208 (3d Cir. 2010) (citation
omitted). Section 922(g)(1) , the statute setting forth the
substantive offense, requires proof that: (1) the defendant has
been convicted of a crime of imprisonment [**5] for a term in excess
of one year; (2) the defendant knowingly possessed the firearm;
and (3) the firearm traveled in inter-state commerce. United States v. Higdon , 638 F.3d 233 , 239-40 (3d
Cir. 2011). Because § 922(g)(1) is not a specific intent
statute, an individual can be convicted as an aider and abettor
under § 922(g)(1) and § 2 if she knew or had reason to
know that she was aiding and abetting possession of a firearm
by a convicted felon. See United States v. Xavier , 2 F.3d 1281 , 1286-87 (3d Cir. 1993). Thus, a valid indictment
under § 922(g)(1) based on an aiding and abetting theory
must allege that: (1) the principal, who had been convicted of
a crime carrying a term of imprisonment in excess of one year,
knowingly possessed a firearm that had traveled in interstate
commerce, Higdon , 638 F.3d at 239-40 , and (2) the
defendant knew or had reason to know that the principal was
prohibited from possessing a firearm, Xavier , 2 F.3d at 1286-87 , and rendered actual aid or assistance to the
principal in possessing the firearm, United States v. Nolan , 718 F.2d 589 , 592 (3d Cir. 1983).
In this case, we conclude that the Indictment adequately set
forth the required elements under § 922(g)(1) and § 2 ,
with "sufficient factual orientation" to allow Huet to prepare
her defense and invoke double jeopardy. See Kemp , 500 F.3d at 280 . Count Three lists all required elements of the
offense. It alleges that: (1) Hall, the principal, had
previously been convicted for Possession of Unregistered
Firearms, an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment in
excess of one year, and that he knowingly possessed a firearm
(the SKS rifle) which had traveled in interstate commerce, see Higdon , 638 F.3d at 239-40 ; and (2) Huet knowingly
aided and abetted Hall's possession of that firearm, see Petersen , 622 F.3d at 208 ; Xavier , 2 F.3d at 1286-87 . Count Three also includes the required "factual
orientation": it specifies the time period during which the
violation occurred ("on or about August 10, 2007, to on or
about January 11, 2008"), see Urban , 404 F.3d at 771 ,
and identifies the specific weapon involved, see McCarty , 862 F.2d at 144 . No more was required to allow
Huet to prepare her defense and invoke double jeopardy. See Kemp , 500 F.3d at 280 . Accordingly, we will reverse the
order of the District Court granting Huet's Rule 12(b)(3)(B)
motion to dismiss for failure to state an offense. [fn6] [*597]
We recognize that the District Court may have adopted the novel
procedure followed here to truncate what it perceived as an
incurably weak Government case. However, in doing so, the
District Court committed two errors: (1) it impermissibly
expanded the scope of its review at the Rule 12 stage and
evaluated the sufficiency of the evidence; and (2) it required
the Government to meet a heightened pleading standard. We will
discuss each of these issues in turn.
First, although the District Court purported to make a purely
"legal" determination based on "undisputed" facts, Huet , [ 2010 BL 276121 ], 2010 WL 4853847, at *2, the language of its
memorandum opinion makes clear that it engaged in factfinding
and determined that, based on those facts, the Government would
not be able to prove its case. The District Court speculated as
to the evidence the Government would introduce at trial, and
concluded that such evidence "[did] nothing to advance the
cause that defendant Huet knew, or had reason to know that
defendant Hall was a felon in [**6] possession and that her
owning a weapon somehow aided or abetted him in his unlawful
possession of the SKS rifle." Id . at *7. By doing
this, the District Court failed to adhere to the fundamental
principle that in reviewing the sufficiency of an indictment, a
court must accept as true all of the facts alleged. Panarella , 277 F.3d at 681 ; see United States v. Gallagher , 602 F.2d 1139 , 1142-43 (3d Cir. 1979).
"Evidentiary questions — such as . . . the weighing of
proof — should not be determined at [the motion to
dismiss] stage." Bergrin , 650 F.3d at 265 (citation
omitted).
Unlike other cases in which we have affirmed a district court's
dismissal of an indictment as insufficient, Huet's case does
not involve a question of whether the facts alleged in the
indictment fall beyond the scope of the relevant criminal
statute as a matter of statutory interpretation. See Panarella , 277 F.3d at 685 ; see also Schiff , 602 F.3d at 161 , 167 (holding that failure to rectify the
misstatements of others does not state an offense under federal
securities laws and thus the government could not proceed on
such a theory); Gov't of the Virgin Islands v. Greenidge , 600 F.2d 437 , 438 (3d Cir. 1979) (finding
indictment for assault with intent to commit rape under 14
V. I.C. § 295(3) insufficient where the facts alleged showed
that the person the defendant assaulted was not the same person
he attempted to rape). [fn7] Rather, the District Court's
determination that the Indictment failed to state an offense
was based solely on its assessment of the strength of the
Government's case.
Moreover, although we have left open the possibility that, in
limited circumstances, a district court may be able to address
the sufficiency of the government's evidence in a pretrial
motion to dismiss, this case does not present such a scenario. See DeLaurentis , 230 F.3d at 660 (acknowledging that
district courts may be able to address sufficiency of the
evidence if there is a stipulated record or if immunity issues
are implicated). [fn8] The [*598] District Court erred in concluding that the facts here are
undisputed. The Government maintains that it will introduce
testimony to prove the elements of aiding and abetting. At no
point during the proceedings before the District Court did the
Government concede that the facts were undisputed or were
complete. In its reply to Huet's motion to dismiss, the
Government explicitly stated that it was "prepared to present
testimony" at trial that would establish that Huet aided and
abetted Hall's possession. The Government maintains this
position on appeal. Thus, the District Court's finding that the
Government lacked evidence beyond mere possession was
premature. [fn9]
Second, the District Court erred to the extent that it imposed
a heightened pleading standard for offenses under 18 U.S.C. § 922 (g)(1) and § 2 . The District Court dismissed Count
Three based on its determination that "[t]he facts in the
Indictment fail[ed] to set forth any allegations to
support the conclusion that . . . Huet aided and abetted . . .
Hall in his unlawful possession of the SKS rifle." Huet , [ 2010 BL 276121 ], 2010 WL 4853847, at *7. The District Court
faulted the Government for failing to include "any specifics"
as to how Huet aided Hall, and determined that the Government
simply "charge[d] its conclusion." [**7] Id . at *4. Although
some offenses must be pled with greater specificity than the
"plain, concise, and definite written statement" contemplated
by Rule 7(c)(1) , we have never held aiding and abetting a felon
in possession under 18 U.S.C. § 922 (g)(1) and § 2 to be
such an offense, and we decline to do so now.
In arguing for a heightened pleading standard, Huet attempts to
distinguish the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Resendiz-Ponce , 549 U.S. 102 , 127 S.Ct. 782 , 166 L.Ed.2d 591 (2007). In that case, the issue was whether an
indictment alleging attempted illegal reentry into the
United States under 8 U.S.C. § 1326 (a) had to allege a specific
overt act. Id. at 103-04 , 127 S.Ct. 782 . The Court
held that the government did not have to include such an
allegation because the use of the word "attempt," coupled with
the specification of the time and place of the defendant's
attempted reentry, was sufficient to put the defendant on
notice of the charges against him . Id. at 108 , 127 S.Ct. 782 . The Court distinguished the heightened pleading
requirements under 2 U.S.C. § 192 , which makes it illegal
for a witness summoned before a congressional committee to
refuse to answer any question "pertinent to the question under
inquiry." Id. at 109 , 127 S.Ct. 782 . Because [*599] the "relevant hearing's subject [is] frequently uncertain
but invariably `central to every prosecution under the
statute,'" the Court explained that an indictment under
§ 192 must go beyond the language of the statute and "allege the
subject of the congressional hearing in order to determine
whether the defendant's refusal was `pertinent.'" Id. (citing Russell v. United States , 369 U.S. 749 , 764 , 82 S.Ct. 1038 , 8 L.Ed.2d 240 (1962)). In contrast, because the
term "attempt," as used in "common parlance," connotes action
and intent, it was deemed unnecessary to specify an overt act
in an indictment under 8 U.S.C. § 1326 (a). Id.
at 107 , 127 S.Ct. 782 . Huet argues that because "a single
affirmative act" may establish an aider and abettor's
culpability, a "concise statement as to [the] means and/or
manner the aider/abetter (sic) used to facilitate the offense
is required." We find Huet's attempt to distinguish "aid and
abet" from "attempt" unpersuasive. Like the term "attempt," the
terms "aid" and "abet," as used in common parlance,
sufficiently connote action and intent. See Resendiz-Ponce , 549 U.S. at 107 , 127 S.Ct. 782 . Thus,
unlike 2 U.S.C. § 192 , no more than the elements of the
statute and the time and place of the alleged violation are
required to inform the defendant of the charge against which
she must defend and enable her to invoke double jeopardy. See Kemp , 500 F.3d at 280 .
Moreover, the District Court's suggestion that Abuelhawa v. United States , 556 U.S. 816 , 129 S.Ct. 2102 , 173 L.Ed.2d 982 (2009), altered the pleading requirements for offenses
involving accomplice liability is a mischaracterization of the
Supreme Court's holding in that case. In Abuelhawa ,
the Court held that making a misdemeanor drug purchase over the
telephone does not constitute "facilitation" of drug
distribution under 21 U.S.C. § 843 (b). Id.
at 2104 . Nowhere in the Abuelhawa opinion did the Court
address the pleading requirements under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 7 . Nor did the decision modify the law of
accomplice liability under 18 U.S.C. § 2 . The elements of
aiding and abetting under § 2 remain the same. The Abuelhawa Court simply addressed a narrow question
regarding the scope of the term "facilitate" under § 843(b) . 129 S.Ct. at 2104 . We decline to extend its holding [**8] any
further.
B.
1.
We turn now to Huet's Second Amendment challenge. The Second Amendment provides: "A well regulated Militia, being necessary
to the security of a free State, the right of the people to
keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed." U.S. Const. amend. II . In District of Columbia v. Heller , 554 U.S. 570 , 595 , 128 S.Ct. 2783 , 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008), the Supreme Court
held for the first time that the Second Amendment confers an
individual right to keep and bear arms. [fn10] The right,
however, is not unlimited. Id . The Second Amendment does not guarantee a "right to keep and carry any weapon
whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose." Id. at 626 , 128 S.Ct. 2783 . The Court cautioned that,
"nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on
longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by
felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of
firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government
buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on [*600] the commercial sale of arms." Id., at 626-27 , 128 S.Ct. 2783 . Laws prohibiting the possession of "dangerous and
unusual weapons" were left similarly intact. Id.
at 627 , 128 S.Ct. 2783 . The Court made clear that it was
"identify[ing] these presumptively lawful regulatory measures
only as examples"; the list was not intended to be
exhaustive. [fn11] Id., at 627 n. 26, 128 S.Ct. 2783 .
Applying these principles, the Court invalidated a District of
Columbia law that completely banned handgun possession in the
home and required any lawful firearm to be kept disassembled
and bound by a trigger lock at all times, rendering it
inoperable. Id. at 628-35 , 128 S.Ct. 2783 . The Court
explained that "the inherent right of self-defense [is] central
to the Second Amendment [,]" and the challenged law
impermissibly extended to the home, "where the need for defense
of self, family, and property is most acute." Id.
at 628 , 128 S.Ct. 2783 . Although the Court did not decide on a
level of scrutiny to be applied in cases involving Second Amendment challenges, it rejected rational basis review. Id., at 628 n. 27, 128 S.Ct. 2783 . The Court explained
that the Second Amendment "elevates above all other interests
the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in
defense of hearth and home." Id. at 635 , 128 S.Ct. 2783 .
In United States v. Marzzarella , we articulated a
two-step analysis for Second Amendment claims under Heller :
First, we ask whether the challenged law imposes a
  burden on conduct falling within the scope of the Second Amendment's guarantee. . . . If it does not,
  our inquiry is complete. If it does, we evaluate the
  law under some form of means-end scrutiny. If the law
  passes muster under that standard, it is
  constitutional. If it fails, it is invalid.
614 F.3d 85 , 89 (3d Cir. 2010) (internal citations omitted).
Under the Marzzarella framework, the "presumptively
lawful" regulatory measures identified by the Supreme Court in Heller carry the presumption of validity because they
regulate conduct "falling outside the scope of the Second Amendment's guarantee." United States v. Barton , 633 F.3d 168 , 172 (3d Cir. 2011) (citing Marzzarella , 614 F.3d at 91 ) (explaining that this is a better reading of Heller than one that would require "presumptively
lawful" regulations to satisfy every level of constitutional
scrutiny). In other words, the long-standing limitations
mentioned by the Court in Heller are exceptions to the
right to bear arms. Marzzarella , 614 F.3d at 91 .
2.
The constitutional question here is presented in an unusual way
due to the procedural posture of the case. The District Court's
characterization of [**9] Huet's challenge as an as-applied attack is
somewhat misleading. In contrast to a facial attack, an
as-applied challenge "does not contend that a law is
unconstitutional as written but that its application to a
particular person under particular circumstances deprived that
person of a constitutional [*601] right." United States v. Marcavage , 609 F.3d 264 , 273 (3d Cir. 2010) (citation omitted). However, because we do
not have the benefit of a fully developed evidentiary record,
the "particular circumstances" of this case remain unclear. As
in its analysis regarding the sufficiency of the Indictment,
the District Court's error on the constitutional issue stems
from its failure to accept as true the allegations in the
Indictment. Because, as we explained above, the charges against
Huet were properly brought under Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure 7 and 12 , in assessing Huet's constitutional
challenge on appeal, we are limited to determining whether,
based on the allegations in the Indictment — and only the
allegations in the Indictment — her Second Amendment rights have been violated. For the reasons set forth below, we
conclude that a charge properly brought under § 922(g)(1) and § 2 does not violate the Second Amendment .
Huet argues that based on the circumstances of her case, she
cannot constitutionally be charged with aiding and abetting a
felon to possess a firearm. Specifically, she contends that the
Government's only evidence is that she possessed the SKS rifle
in her home while living with a convicted felon. The District
Court agreed, finding that "to permit [the] Indictment to go
forward" would be to "countenance[e] the total elimination of
the right of a sane, non-felonious citizen to possess a
firearm, in her home, simply because her paramour is a felon." Huet , [ 2010 BL 276121 ], 2010 WL 4853847, at *11.
We disagree. We cannot say that an indictment which properly
alleges aiding and abetting a felon in possession under 18 U.S.C. § 922 (g)(1) and § 2 violates the Second Amendment under Heller. Applying Marzzarella ,
a properly-brought aiding and abetting charge does not burden
conduct protected by the Second Amendment . See 614 F.3d at 89 . The District Court's characterization of the
Indictment as seeking to criminalize the otherwise legal
possession of a firearm by a non-felon simply because she lives
with a felon is misleading. The Indictment does not allege that
Huet's possession of the SKS rifle violated the law; rather, it
alleges that Huet aided and abetted Hall to possess the
firearm. We are mindful of the risk that felon dispossession
statutes, when combined with laws regarding accomplice
liability, may be misused to subject law-abiding cohabitants to
liability simply for possessing a weapon in the home. However,
in this case, the District Court's determination that the
Government overreached was premature. Huet's arguments
regarding the circumstances of her possession must await
further development of the evidentiary record.
Huet's argument that her status as a non-felon brings her case
within the scope of Second Amendment protection is unavailing.
Relying on our decision in United States v. Barton , 633 F.3d 168 (3d Cir. 2011), Huet argues that, as a person
legally entitled to own a firearm, she is categorically
different [**10] than a felon, and thus cannot be charged under § 922(g)(1) for possessing a firearm. This argument is flawed.
Huet's status in relation to prohibited persons is irrelevant.
She is correct that her circumstances distinguish her from
"persons historically barred from Second Amendment protections"; she is not barred from Second Amendment protection at all. The Government readily concedes that Huet
would not violate § 922(g)(1) simply by possessing a
firearm. She would, however, violate § 922(g)(1) and § 2 by aiding and abetting a felon to possess a
firearm. Count Three charges her with the latter. Thus, the
fact that [*602] she is not within the class of persons prohibited from
possessing a firearm is irrelevant; her right to possess a
firearm is not implicated by the charges against her. Moreover,
even if part of the conduct that allegedly aided and abetted
Hall's possession involved possession of the firearm by Huet,
the Second Amendment does not afford citizens a right to carry
arms for "any purpose." Heller , 554 U.S. at 595 , 128 S.Ct. 2783 . Huet's right to keep the SKS rifle in her home did
not give her the right to facilitate Hall's possession of the
weapon. Otherwise illegal conduct does not somehow become
immunized because possession of a firearm is involved in the
offense. See, e.g., United States v. Potter , 630 F.3d 1260 , 1261 (9th Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (rejecting a defendant's
challenge to his conviction for possession of a firearm in
furtherance of drug trafficking and concluding that "[e]ven if
[the defendant] kept the firearm also to protect
himself and his home," it could not "seriously be contended
that the Second Amendment guarantees a right to use a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking ").
Because the conduct alleged in Count Three is beyond the scope
of Second Amendment protection, our inquiry under Marzzarella is complete. See 614 F.3d at 89 .
We need not conduct a means-end inquiry. See id . However, in Marzzarella , we cautioned that because Second Amendment jurisprudence is "in its nascency," we must
tread carefully when deciding whether to find conduct not
explicitly identified by the Heller Court as subject
to "presumptively lawful" restrictions as unprotected by the Second Amendment . Id. at 101 . In other words, prong
one of Marzzarella (whether conduct is protected by
the Second Amendment ) should be applied with caution. Because
we could not be certain that the provision at issue in Marzzarella , 18 U.S.C. § 922 (k), which prohibits
possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number,
regulated conduct not protected by the Second Amendment , we
declined to decide the case on prong one. Id.
at 94-95 . However, because it is clear to us that the allegations
in Count Three fall outside the scope of Second Amendment protection, we do not hesitate to base our decision on prong
one of Marzzarella in this case.
Our primary concern in Marzzarella was one of
line-drawing, specifically, whether a firearm with an
obliterated serial number was a "dangerous and unusual weapon." 614 F.3d at 87 , 94-95 . Although the Court in Heller stated that possession of "dangerous" firearms is not
protected, it did not define what constitutes a "dangerous"
firearm. See 554 U.S. at 627 , 128 S.Ct. 2783 . In Marzzarella , we noted the difficulty in determining
whether a gun with an obliterated serial number was "dangerous"
or "unusual." 614 F.3d at 101 . On the one hand, because an
unmarked firearm is equally effective as a marked firearm, thus
giving [**11] law-abiding citizens no reason to prefer the former over
the latter, unmarked firearms "have value primarily for persons
seeking to use them for illicit purposes." Id. at 95 (citations omitted). On the other hand, the absence of a serial
number seems categorically different than other "dangerous"
characteristics, such as a sawed-off barrel on a shotgun. Id . Although a sawed-off shotgun "is dangerous and
unusual in that its concealability fosters its use in illicit
activity, it is also dangerous and unusual because of its
heightened capability to cause damage." Id . (citing United States v. Amos , 501 F.3d 524 , 532 (6th
Cir. 2007) (McKeague, J., dissenting)).
Huet's case presents no line-drawing problem. Because § 922(g)(1) and § 2 do not restrict the right of possession
of the aider and abettor, Count Three simply does not implicate
Huet's rights under the [*603] Second Amendment . Thus, unlike the restriction at issue in Marzzarella , we do not have to broaden any of Hellers presumptively valid categories to find that
the conduct alleged in Count Three is outside the scope of Second Amendment protection. See Marzzarella , 614 F.3d at 101 .
IV.
For the foregoing reasons, we will reverse the order of the
District Court granting Huet's motion to dismiss and remand for
further proceedings. We hold that: (1) Count Three was
sufficient to state an offense for aiding and abetting a felon
in possession under 18 U.S.C. § 922 (g)(1) and § 2 ; and
(2) Count Three does not violate the Second Amendment .
[fn1] Section 922(g)(1) states:
It shall be unlawful for any person — who has
  been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by
  imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . to
  ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce,
  or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or
  ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition
  which has been shipped or transported in interstate or
  foreign commerce.
[fn2] Section 2(a) states: "Whoever commits an offense against
the United States or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces
or procures its commission, is punishable as a principal."
[fn3] Rule 12(b)(3)(B) provides: "[A]t any time while the case
is pending, the court may hear a claim that the indictment
. . . fails to . . . state an offense."
[fn4] The affidavit provides, in pertinent part:
Huet indicated that she was angry that Hall had been
  showing off an SKS assault rifle. Huet said that if it
  happened again, she would take it "back" to Morgan.
  Huet further elaborated that she was worried that if
  Hall "gets in trouble with that, I get in trouble too.
  Cause it's in my name, and he's got it."
[fn5] At Hall's guilty plea hearing, the Assistant U.S.
Attorney stated:
Mr. Hall lived with . . . Melissa Huet, . . . [who]
  had no prior record of which we are aware, but . . .
  bought firearms in her name for Morgan Jones, who on
  the side sold firearms. . . . Miss Huet would allow
  Mr. Hall to have access to those firearms. In essence,
  that's the very basis of the charge against Mr.
  Hall.
[fn6] Because we conclude that the Indictment should not have
been dismissed, we do not address whether the District Court
abused its discretion by dismissing the Indictment with
prejudice.
[fn7] The only potential question of statutory interpretation
— whether the SKS rifle was a "dangerous" or "unusual"
firearm — was determined by the District Court when it
took judicial notice of the fact that the SKS rifle was not an
"assault weapon," but instead had been designated as a "curio"
by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and was used
primarily by hunters and collectors. See United States v. Huet , No. 08-0215 , [ 2010 BL 276121 ], 2010 WL 4853847, at *4-5 (W.D.Pa. Nov.
22, 2010). That finding is not at issue on appeal.
[fn8] Although DeLaurentis indicated that there is an
exception to the general rule barring district courts from
considering the sufficiency of the evidence at the Rule 12
stage, we have never explicitly held that such an exception
exists, much less defined its contours. We decline to do so
now. We simply hold that, assuming an exception exists for
cases involving a stipulated record or immunity issues, the
circumstances of this case do not trigger it.
[fn9] We note that there is a split among our sister circuits
as to whether a district court is ever permitted to rule on a
motion to dismiss based on the sufficiency of the evidence.
Some courts have indicated that in "rare" and "unusual" cases,
it may be appropriate for a court to look to the sufficiency of
the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Levin , 973 F.2d 463 , 466-67 (6th Cir. 1992) (affirming district court's
dismissal of an indictment under Rule 12 where the prosecutor
conceded that the facts were undisputed, and based on the
undisputed facts, the defendant could not have formed the
requisite intent to commit the crime). Other circuits have
rejected this approach. See, e.g., United States v. Salman , 378 F.3d 1266 , 1268 (11th Cir. 2004) (holding that
"there is no explicit authority to grant a pre-trial judgment
as a matter of law on the merits under the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure" and thus, the government should be allowed
to present its evidence at trial, subject to the defendant's
moving for a judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 29 ).
[fn10] In McDonald v. City of Chi. , ___ U.S. ___ , 130 S.Ct. 3020 , 3050 , 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010), a splintered
plurality of the Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment is applicable to the states, through the Fourteenth Amendment .
[fn11] Although some of our sister circuits have classified the
"presumptively lawful" language in Heller as dicta, see United States v. Scroggins , 599 F.3d 433 , 451 (5th
Cir. 2010); United States v. McCane , 573 F.3d 1037 , 1047 (10th Cir. 2009) (Tymkovich, J., concurring), we disagree.
In United States v. Barton , 633 F.3d 168 , 171 (3d
Cir. 2011), we explicitly held that Heller's list of
"presumptively lawful" regulations was not dicta, and thus we
are bound by it. See also United States v. Rozier , 598 F.3d 768 , 771 n. 6 (11th Cir. 2010); United States v. Vongxay , 594 F.3d 1111 , 1115 (9th Cir. 2010) (explaining
that Heller Court's "presumptively lawful" list was a
limitation on the scope of its holding).
