[ 2010 BL 303012 ], 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 132727, 2010 WL 5376310 (D.Del. Dec. 22, 2010). For
the reasons indicated below, we affirm. [**1677]
BACKGROUND
The dispute before us involves patented methods for using the
cholesterol-lowering drug rosuvastatin calcium. Rosuvastatin
calcium is one member of a widely prescribed class of drugs
known as statins, which serve to reduce circulating cholesterol
by competitively inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, or HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the
cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. AstraZeneca markets
rosuvastatin calcium under the brand name CRESTOR® and
holds the rights to three related patents relevant to this
appeal. U.S. Patent RE37.314 ("the ′314 patent") claims
rosuvastatin compounds and pharmaceutical compositions
containing such compounds. U.S. Patent 6,858,618 ("the
′618 patent") claims methods of using rosuvastatin
compounds to treat heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia
("HeFH"), a genetic condition characterized by impaired
cholesterol metabolism and clinically elevated blood
cholesterol, and U.S. Patent 7,030,152 ("the ′152
patent") claims methods of using rosuvastatin compounds to
lower the cardiovascular disease risk for individuals who have
normal cholesterol levels but demonstrate elevated circulating
C-reactive protein ("CRP"), another risk factor associated with
various cardiovascular disorders. The ′314 composition
patent expires in 2016, while the ′618 and ′152
method of use patents expire in 2021 and 2018,
respectively. [fn1]
AstraZeneca filed a New Drug Application ("NDA") to market
rosuvastatin calcium and obtained approval from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration ("FDA") on August 12, 2003. As required
by the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act
of 1984 (popularly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, hereinafter
"the Act"), AstraZeneca notified the FDA of all patents that it
believed could be infringed by the unlicensed manufacture, use,
or sale of rosuvastatin calcium to be published in the FDA's Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (known as "the Orange Book"). See 21 U.S.C. § 355 (b)(1). Among those patents, AstraZeneca listed
the ′314, ′618, and ′152 patents. The
approved NDA and AstraZeneca's corresponding CRESTOR®
labeling cover several indications for using rosuvastatin
calcium, including treatment of HeFH in pediatric patients and
preventative use in high-risk patients with elevated CRP. J.A.
152. While these indications may fall under AstraZeneca's
method patents, the FDA also approved rosuvastatin calcium for [***3] treating homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia ("HoFH") and
hypertriglyceridemia — uses not claimed by either of the
′618 or ′152 patents. Thus, the FDA approved
rosuvastatin calcium for a number of different treatment
indications, some of which may be protected by AstraZeneca's
′618 and ′152 patents, i.e. , the HeFH and
elevated CRP indications, as well as others not subject to any
such [*1374] patent rights, e.g. , treatment of HoFH and
hypertriglyceridemia.
Appellees are generic pharmaceutical manufacturers that filed
Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDAs") with the FDA
seeking to market generic rosuvastatin calcium. As set forth
at 21 U.S.C. § 355 (j)(2)(A)(i), the Act only allows ANDA
filers to obtain approval for marketing drugs for uses that
have been approved under a preexisting NDA. In this case,
Appellees further restricted their ANDAs, requesting approval
to offer their generic rosuvastatin formulations for treating
only HoFH and hypertriglyceridemia while omitting or "carving
out" patented indications directed toward HeFH and elevated
CRP. Mylan's proposed labeling is representative:
INDICATIONS AND USAGE
Rosuvastatin calcium tablets are an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor
indicated for:
• patients with hypertriglyeridemia as an adjunct
  to diet (1.2)
• patients with homozygous familial
  hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) to reduce LDL-C, total-C,
  and ApoB (1.4)
J.A. 284. It appears undisputed that none of Appellees' ANDAs
sought approval to market rosuvastatin calcium specifically for
the HeFH or high-CRP indications disclosed in the ′618
and ′152 patents.
Appellees' ANDAs also addressed each rosuvastatin-related
patent listed in the Orange Book. The Act requires each ANDA
applicant to certify that (1) the Orange Book contains no
patent information relevant to their ANDA ("Paragraph I
certification"), (2) the listed patents have expired
("Paragraph II certification"), (3) the applicant will not
enter the market until the listed patents expire (" [**1678] Paragraph
III certification"), or (4) the applicant believes that the
listed patents are invalid or will not be infringed by the
applicant's generic compositions ("Paragraph IV
certification"). 21 U.S.C. § 355 (j)(2)(A)(vii)(I)- (IV) (2006). The Act specifies that filing an ANDA containing a
Paragraph IV certification constitutes an act of infringement. 35 U.S.C. § 271 (e)(2) (2006); Glaxo, Inc. v. Novopharm, Ltd. , 110 F.3d 1562 , 1568-69 (Fed. Cir. 1997). Where the
Orange Book lists a method of use patent that "does not claim a
use for which the applicant is seeking approval," an applicant
may instead submit a statement under 21 U.S.C. § 355 (j)(2)(A)(viii) averring that the ANDA excludes all uses
claimed in the patent ("Section viii statement"). Warner-Lambert Co. v. Apotex Corp. , 316 F.3d 1348 , 1360-61 (Fed. Cir. 2003).
Accordingly, Appellees filed Paragraph IV certifications with
regard to the ′314 composition patent, but, having only
sought approval for unpatented methods of using generic
rosuvastatin calcium for treating HoFH and hypertriglyeridemia,
they submitted Section viii statements regarding the ′618
and ′152 method of use patents. [fn2] Appellees notified
AstraZeneca of their ANDA filings in late 2007 as required
under 21 U.S.C. § 355 (j)(2)(B)(ii).
In December [***4] 2007, AstraZeneca responded by suing Appellees for
infringement of the ′314 composition patent under § 271(e)(2) . After a bench trial, the district court ruled on
June 29, 2010, in favor of AstraZeneca on infringement,
validity, and enforceability of the ′314 patent,
enjoining Appellees from making, using, or selling rosuvastatin
calcium until the ′314 [*1375] patent expires in 2016. Appellees have separately appealed
that decision. In re Rosuvastatin Calcium Patent Litig. , 719 F.Supp.2d 388 (D.Del. 2010), appeal docketed , Nos. 10-1460 to -1473 (Fed. Cir. Aug. 13, 2010).
While the ′314 infringement matter remained pending
before the district court, AstraZeneca brought a second § 271(e)(2) action against Appellees in April 2010 that
ultimately gave rise to this appeal. [fn3] AstraZeneca alleged
that Appellees' ANDA filings infringed and would cause
infringement of the ′618 and 152 method patents, even
though Appellees had not requested approval for any patented
indications and had filed Section viii statements to that
effect. In particular, AstraZeneca's complaints stated:
25. On information and belief, the FDA will require
  the label for the [Appellees'] Rosuvastatin Calcium
  Tablets to include information relating to the use to
  treat pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age having
  HeFH.
. . . .
27. On information and belief, the labeling associated
  with the [Appellees'] Rosuvastatin Calcium Tablets
  causes [their ANDAs] to be an application for a drug
  the use of which is claimed in the ′618 patent
  in violation of 35 U.S.C. § 271 (e)(2)(A).
. . . .
29. On information and belief, the [Appellees']
  Rosuvastatin Calcium Tablets, if approved by the FDA,
  will be prescribed and administered to human patients
  to treat HeFH, which uses will constitute direct
  infringement of the ′618 patent. . . . On
  information and belief, [Appellees] will actively
  induce, encourage, and aid and abet this prescription
  and administration, with knowledge and specific intent
  that these uses will be in contravention of
  [AstraZeneca's] rights under the ′618
  patent. [fn4]
J.A. 164-65. Each complaint also included analogous counts
alleging infringement of the ′152 patent. E.g. ,
J.A. 166-67, ¶¶ 39-43. In short, AstraZeneca alleged that:
(1) Appellees' ANDAs, as filed, violated § 271(e)(2) as
"application[s] for a drug the use of which is claimed" in the
′618 and 152 patents; (2) if approved by the FDA,
Appellees' proposed activities will induce infringement of the
′618 and 152 patents; and (3) the FDA will require
Appellees to make labeling amendments explicitly incorporating
the indications covered by the ′618 and 152 patents.
Appellees moved to dismiss on three grounds. First, Appellees
argued that the district court lacked subject matter
jurisdiction over AstraZeneca's claims because [**1679] § 271(e)(2)
creates a case or controversy only if the accused ANDA contains
a Paragraph IV certification, but Appellees instead filed
Section viii statements concerning the asserted method patents.
In addition, Appellees argued that the infringement claims were
unripe because AstraZeneca alleged that the FDA might, at some
undetermined point in the future, require that Appellees amend
their ANDAs to include the patented [***5] indications. Finally,
Appellees argued that, even if the court could exercise
jurisdiction, the complaints failed to state a claim under
§ 271(e)(2) because AstraZeneca had not alleged and could
not allege that Appellees' ANDAs included Paragraph IV
certifications [*1376] or sought approval to market rosuvastatin calcium for uses
claimed in the ′618 or ′152 patents.
The district court dismissed AstraZeneca's infringement claims,
ruling that it lacked jurisdiction because AstraZeneca had not
presented a valid § 271(e)(2) claim based on Appellees'
ANDA filings. AstraZeneca , 2010 WL 5376310 , at *10-14.
The court also held that AstraZeneca's claims were unripe to
the extent that they relied on presumptive future labeling
amendment. Id. at *15.
AstraZeneca now appeals, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1295 (a)(1).
DISCUSSION
We review de novo a district court's decision to
dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and we review
any underlying factual findings for clear error. Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Acceleron LLC , 587 F.3d 1358 , 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2009). Like the district court, we test the
sufficiency of a complaint as a matter of law, accepting as
true all non-conclusory allegations of fact. Bradley v. Chiron Corp. , 136 F.3d 1317 , 1321-22 (Fed. Cir. 1998). We
also review statutory interpretation, which is a question of
law, without deference. Waymark Corp. v. Porta Sys. Corp. , 245 F.3d 1364 , 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2001).
As described, AstraZeneca's complaints advanced two basic
theories of patent infringement under § 271(e)(2). First,
AstraZeneca alleged that, as filed, Appellees' ANDAs infringe
the ′618 and ′152 method patents because their
approval would result in unlicensed sales of a drug having
FDA-approved, patent-protected uses, inevitably infringing
AstraZeneca's method patents contrary to the plain language and
legislative aims of § 271(e)(2). AstraZeneca also asserted
that the FDA would ultimately block Appellees' formal efforts
to carve out the patented indications by requiring amendments
extending their ANDAs to include all approved
indications for rosuvastatin calcium — including those
covered by the ′618 and ′152 patents. The district
court dismissed these claims on separate grounds, and we
address each in turn.
A. Appellees' ANDAs as Filed
The district court dismissed AstraZeneca's primary
§ 271(e)(2) infringement claims for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction. The court reasoned that § 271(e)(2) creates
in the ANDA context a limited, technical, and artificial cause
of action where none would otherwise exist, so that in such
cases "a district court's jurisdiction turns on whether a
plaintiff asserts a valid claim under Section 271(e)(2). . . .
[I]n the absence of a Section 271(e)(2) claim, there is no
justiciable case or controversy between the parties." Astrazeneca , 2010 WL 5376310 , at *11. Concluding that
AstraZeneca had failed to state a valid § 271(e)(2) claim
because Appellees' ANDAs excluded all methods of using
rosuvastatin calcium claimed in the asserted patents, the
district court dismissed AstraZeneca's claims pursuant to
Fed.R.Civ.P. 12 (b)(1).
AstraZeneca protests that, by alleging patent infringement
under § 271(e)(2) , it has asserted a claim for relief
arising under federal patent [***6] law and has thus met the basic
jurisdictional requirements specified in 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1338 (a). In addition, AstraZeneca argues that § 271(e)(2) is not a jurisdiction-conferring statute and that the
district court improperly conflated its jurisdictional analysis
with scrutiny of the claims on their merits. Appellees
defend the district court's dismissal as properly premised on
jurisdictional grounds.
[1] As a preliminary matter, we agree with AstraZeneca that its
infringement claims based on Appellees' existing ANDAs were [*1377] within the district court's jurisdiction. The district
courts have original jurisdiction over any civil action arising
under any Act of Congress relating to patents. 28 U.S.C. § 1338 (a). The Supreme Court has described § 271(e)(2) as
creating "a highly artificial act of infringement" triggered
upon submission of an ANDA containing an erroneous Paragraph IV
certification. Eli Lilly & Co. v. Medtronic, Inc. , 496 U.S. 661 , 678 , 110 S.Ct. 2683 , 110 L.Ed.2d 605 (1990). We
have further explained that § 271(e)(2) provided a new
cause of action so that courts could promptly resolve
infringement and validity disputes before the ANDA [**1680] applicant
had engaged in the traditional statutorily defined acts of
infringement. Glaxo , 110 F.3d at 1569 . By enacting § 271(e)(2) , Congress thus established a specialized new
cause of action for patent infringement. When patentees pursue
this route, their claims necessarily arise under an Act of
Congress relating to patents. In short, "[o]nce Congress
creates an act of infringement, jurisdiction in the district
courts is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1338 (a)." Allergan, Inc. v. Alcon Labs., Inc. , 324 F.3d 1322 , 1330 (Fed. Cir.
2003).
In Allergan , we addressed a similar jurisdictional
challenge to an infringement suit brought under § 271(e)(2) . There, as here, the plaintiff held method patents
directed toward certain uses of a drug, competitors filed ANDAs
seeking to market the drug for other uses, and the plaintiff
brought suit claiming that the ANDAs infringed its method of
use patents under § 271(e)(2) . Id. at 1328 . The
defendant competitors argued that § 271(e)(2) did not
provide jurisdiction because their ANDAs sought approval for
uses not covered by the asserted patents, but we held that
" section 271(e)(2) makes it possible for the district court to
exercise its section 1338(a) jurisdiction in the situation in
which an ANDA has been filed." Id. at 1330 . In other
words, the requirements for jurisdiction in the district courts
are met once a patent owner alleges that another's filing of an
ANDA infringes its patent under § 271(e)(2) , and this
threshold jurisdictional determination does not depend on the
ultimate merits of the claims.
Consistent with Allergan , we conclude that the
district court erred in holding that its jurisdiction hinged on
whether AstraZeneca asserted a "valid" claim under § 271(e)(2) . AstraZeneca alleged that the Appellees' ANDA filings
infringed its listed patents under § 271(e)(2) , and nothing
more was required to establish the district court's subject
matter jurisdiction pursuant to § 1338(a) .
[2] While the district court erroneously concluded that it lacked
subject matter jurisdiction over AstraZeneca's claims, its
judgment of dismissal was nevertheless correct, for we agree
with the district court's underlying determination that
AstraZeneca [***7] failed to state a viable claim for relief under § 271(e)(2) . See Samish Indian Nation v. United States , 419 F.3d 1355 , 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("The court can
affirm the trial court on any basis in the record."); Susquehanna Valley Alliance v. Three Mile Island Nuclear Reactor , 619 F.2d 231 , 239 (3d Cir. 1980) ("Returning that
Count to the district court for the entry of a dismissal under
Fed.R.Civ.P. 12 (b)(6), rather than under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12 (b)(1),
would be a futile exercise.").
We are guided in this conclusion by the language of § 271(e)(2) itself and by our decision in Warner-Lambert. Section 271(e)(2) provides as follows:
It shall be an act of infringement to submit —
  (A) an application [ i.e. , an ANDA] under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
  Act [codified at 21 U.S.C. § 355 (j)] for a drug
  claimed in a patent or the use of which is
  claimed in a patent . . . if the purpose of such
  submission is to obtain approval [*1378] under such Act to engage in the commercial
  manufacture, use, or sale of a drug . . . claimed in a
  patent or the use of which is claimed in a
  patent before the expiration of such patent.
35 U.S.C. § 271 (e)(2) (emphases added). In Warner-Lambert , we construed the term "the use" as
used in § 271(e)(2)(A) to mean "the use listed in the ANDA"
based on our evaluation of the statutory language, its context
within the Act, and the legislative history behind its
enactment. 316 F.3d at 1356-60 . Accordingly, we held that it is
not necessarily an act of infringement under § 271(e)(2) to
submit an ANDA for a drug if just any use of that drug
is claimed in a patent; rather, infringement of method claims
under § 271(e)(2) requires filing an ANDA wherein at least
one "use" listed in the ANDA is claimed in a patent. Id. at 1358-59.
Relying on Warner-Lambert , the district court
determined that AstraZeneca had not stated a claim under
§ 271(e)(2) as a predicate to its decision to dismiss for lack of
jurisdiction. The district court held that Warner-Lambert defined the boundaries of
§ 271(e)(2) claims by establishing that "ANDA applicants could
carve out patented uses from their ANDAs even if those uses
were FDA-approved." Astrazeneca , 2010 WL 5376310 , at
*13. The district court therefore concluded that there can be
no cause of action for infringement of a method of use claim
under § 271(e)(2) unless the accused ANDA actually seeks
approval for a patented indication. Id. at *14.
Because Appellees had excluded any patented treatment
indications from their ANDAs, [fn5] the [**1681] district court concluded
that AstraZeneca "[does] not have a claim under
Section 271(e)(2)." Id.
AstraZeneca first asserts that the district court employed an
unduly narrow reading of § 271(e)(2). It claims that the
"plain and unambiguous" language of § 271(e)(2) supports
its infringement claims, quoting the statute "in relevant part"
as follows: "It shall be an act of infringement to submit
— (A) an application under section 505(j) of the Federal
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [ i.e. , an ANDA] . . . for
a drug . . . the use of which is claimed in a patent. . . ."
Non-Confidential Br. for Plaintiffs-Appellants at 23
(formatting in original). AstraZeneca thus argues that it
stated cognizable claims under § 271(e)(2) by alleging that
Appellees filed ANDAs for "a drug," rosuvastatin calcium, "the
use of which is claimed in a patent," such as the ′618
and ′152 patents. However, AstraZeneca's selective
quotation [***8] omits key language from § 271(e)(2), condensing
the statutory bases for liability to filing an ANDA for "a drug
. . . the use of which is claimed in a patent," rather than
using the actual language of the statute reading "a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is claimed in
a patent." 35 U.S.C. § 271 (e)(2)(A) (emphasis added). In
fact, AstraZeneca's argument stems from the same misleading
"abridged quotation" of § 271(e)(2) proffered by the
plaintiff in [*1379] Warner-Lambert. See 316 F.3d at 1355 . Then as now,
we rejected this parsing of the statute because it "eviscerated
an important part of the statutory provision by conflating the
first and second clauses of § 271(e)(2)(A) ," id . ,
and we again reject the contention that filing an ANDA for a
drug having any patented use automatically constitutes
infringement under § 271(e)(2) . As we held in Warner-Lambert , a patented method of using a drug can
only be infringed under § 271(e)(2) by filing an ANDA that
seeks approval to market the drug for that use. Id.
at 1358 - 59 . Thus, an ANDA seeking to market a drug not covered by
a composition patent for unpatented methods of treatment cannot
infringe under § 271(e)(2) . AstraZeneca has not alleged,
nor could it allege, that Appellees' ANDAs seek FDA approval
for uses of rosuvastatin calcium covered by the ′618 or
′152 patents as would be required to state a viable
§ 271(e)(2) claim.
AstraZeneca attempts to distinguish Warner-Lambert on
its facts, pointing out that the patent asserted in that case
claimed an unapproved or "off-label" use, while AstraZeneca's
′618 and ′152 patents recite FDA-approved uses for
rosuvastatin calcium. AstraZeneca urges that a generic
manufacturer's formal carve-out has less significance where a
patent holder has expended the considerable effort and
resources required to obtain FDA approval for its patented
method of use. In such cases, according to AstraZeneca, not
only has the patent holder engaged in precisely the type of
innovative activity that the Act sought to encourage, but such
patentees — claiming FDA-approved therapeutic
applications already familiar in the market — also face
more compelling infringement risks than a patentee claiming
unapproved uses for a drug as in Warner-Lambert. AstraZeneca therefore argues that Warner-Lambert is
inapposite and does not compel us to preclude all
§ 271(e)(2) claims based on method of use patents where the ANDA
does not expressly recite a patented method.
These arguments are unavailing. Although AstraZeneca is correct
that the patent at issue in Warner-Lambert claimed an
off-label use for a drug, that distinction is irrelevant for
purposes of § 271(e)(2). When considering allegations that
an ANDA filing infringes a patented method, § 271(e)(2)
directs our analysis to the scope of approval sought in the
ANDA — the statute defines the infringing act as filing
an ANDA for "a drug claimed in a patent or the use of which is
claimed in a patent." 35 U.S.C. § 271 (e)(2)(A). And while
generic applicants cannot obtain approval for uses beyond those
already approved by the FDA, 21 U.S.C. § 355 (j)(2)(A)(i),
nothing in the Act requires that an ANDA must encompass every approved indication. As we explained in Warner-Lambert :
Congress recognized that a single drug [***9] could have more
  than one indication and yet that the ANDA applicant
  could seek approval for less than all of those
  indications. Congress clearly contemplated that the
  FDA could grant approval . . . of an ANDA, [**1682] seeking to
  market a drug for a single indication even when other
  indications were known or even approved. . . . [T]he
  applicant needs only to certify [under Paragraph IV]
  with respect to use patents that claim an indication for which the applicant is seeking approval to market the drug.
Warner-Lambert , 316 F.3d at 1360 . In other words, the
Act allows generic manufacturers to limit the scope of
regulatory approval they seek — and thereby forego
Paragraph IV certification and a § 271(e)(2) infringement
suit — by excluding patented indications from their
ANDAs. We see no reason why those provisions would, on the one
hand, foreclose § 271(e)(2) liability if an ANDA excludes a [*1380] patented but unapproved use as in Warner-Lambert , and yet, under otherwise identical
circumstances, allow AstraZeneca to pursue § 271(e)(2) claims based on the patented, FDA-approved uses that
were carved out in this case.
AstraZeneca also argues that following Warner-Lambert would enable generic manufacturers to unilaterally insulate
themselves from infringement under § 271(e)(2) by filing
ANDAs with improper or misleading Section viii statements. But
AstraZeneca does not allege or argue that Appellees'
Section viii statements were erroneous, nor would an unfounded
Section viii statement necessarily immunize an ANDA that actually seeks
approval for a patented treatment or necessarily leave the
patentee without recourse under § 271(e)(2) . We do not
opine on such a fact situation not before us.
AstraZeneca also argues that Section viii statements and
restricted generic labeling ignore market realities because
even if a generic drug is formally approved only for unpatented
uses, pharmacists and doctors will nonetheless substitute the
generic for all indications once it becomes available. We find
this argument unpersuasive. First, AstraZeneca's position
would, in practice, vitiate § 355(j)(2)(A)(viii) by
enabling § 271(e)(2) infringement claims despite the fact
that Appellees' Section viii statements and corresponding
proposed labeling explicitly and undisputedly carve out all
patented indications for rosuvastatin calcium. Moreover, if
accepted, these speculative arguments would allow a pioneer
drug manufacturer to maintain de facto indefinite exclusivity
over a pharmaceutical compound by obtaining serial patents for
approved methods of using the compound and then wielding § 271(e)(2) "as a sword against any competitor's ANDA seeking
approval to market an off-patent drug for an approved use not
covered by the patent. Generic manufacturers would effectively
be barred altogether from entering the market." Warner-Lambert , 316 F.3d at 1359 . We cannot agree with
this expansive view of § 271(e)(2) , which is contrary to
the statutory scheme. If an off-patent drug is being used for
an unpatented use, that is activity beyond the scope of § 271(a) . So is filing an ANDA seeking to market an unpatented
drug for an unpatented use beyond the scope of § 271(e)(2) .
In summary, the conclusions [***10] set forth in Warner-Lambert also govern the facts of this case.
Because Appellees have submitted ANDAs seeking approval to
market rosuvastatin calcium for uses that are not subject to
AstraZeneca's ′618 and ′152 method of use patents,
AstraZeneca does not state a claim for infringement of these
patents under § 271(e)(2).
B. AstraZeneca's Proposed Labeling Amendments
In addition, AstraZeneca also alleged that "the FDA mil require the label for [Appellees'] Rosuvastatin Calcium
Tablets to include information relating to" the uses claimed in
the ′618 and ′152 patents. E.g. , J.A. 164
(emphasis added). In effect, AstraZeneca alleged that the FDA
will require Appellees to amend their ANDAs at some unspecified
point in the future to include all FDA-approved indications for
rosuvastatin calcium, including those covered by the ′618
and ′152 patents, resulting in infringement under
§ 271(e)(2). The district court dismissed those claims under
Fed.R.Civ.P. 12 (b)(1), deeming them insufficiently ripe for
adjudication. We agree with the district court.
[3] Among the requirements for establishing a justiciable case or
controversy under Article III, a dispute must present issues
that are ripe for judicial resolution. "A claim is not ripe for
adjudication if it rests on contingent future events that may
not occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all." Texas v. United States , [*1381] 523 U.S. 296 , 300 , 118 S.Ct. 1257 , 140 L.Ed.2d 406 (1998)
(internal quotations omitted). In the context of patent
infringement actions under § 271(e)(2), we have held that
" Section 271(e)(2) does not encompass `speculative' claims for
infringement." Warner-Lambert , 316 F.3d at 1364 .
Regardless what may or may not occur in the future, the
infringement analysis under § 271(e)(2) is limited to
whether the accused infringer's ANDA seeks approval for
activities that would constitute infringement of the asserted
patents. Id. at 1364-65. [**1683]
In view of the foregoing requirements, AstraZeneca's claims
based on presumed future labeling amendments are unripe. As we
have noted, the Act permits generic manufacturers to file ANDAs
directed to a subset of FDA-approved indications and even
provides a mechanism for ANDA applicants to affirmatively carve
out patented indications by submitting Section viii statements.
In this case, Appellees have limited their ANDAs to unpatented
methods for using rosuvastatin calcium, nothing in the record
indicates that the FDA has required Appellees to add further
indications, and we see no reason to presume that the FDA will
do so in the future. In fact, as Appellees point out, the FDA
has tentatively approved several of their ANDAs without issuing
any such requirements. E.g. , J.A. 206-10. Accordingly,
the district court correctly dismissed AstraZeneca's claims as
unripe to the extent that they rely on prospective labeling
amendments for Appellees' generic rosuvastatin calcium because
these claims rest on contingent future events that may never
occur.
CONCLUSION
While the district court erred in part by concluding that
AstraZeneca's failure to state a cognizable § 271(e)(2)
claim defeated its jurisdiction, we nonetheless agree that (1)
AstraZeneca [***11] failed to state a § 271(e)(2) claim based on
Appellees' existing ANDA filings, and (2) AstraZeneca's claims
premised on presumed future labeling amendments were not ripe
for adjudication. We therefore affirm the district court's
judgment dismissing the complaint.
AFFIRMED
[fn1] AstraZeneca is also the assignee of U.S. Patent
6,316,460, which discloses and claims particular pharmaceutical
compositions comprising a rosuvastatin compound and a tribasic
phosphate salt. The ′460 patent is not involved in this
appeal.
[fn2] Individual appellees Aurobindo Pharma, Sun Pharmaceutical
Industries, and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA originally submitted
Paragraph IV certifications regarding the ′618 patent but
later amended their ANDAs to replace those certifications with
Section viii statements.
[fn3] Individual appellees Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and
Torrent Pharma Inc. were sued separately on July 8, 2010, and
joined in the consolidated action. J.A. 395-404.
[fn4] AstraZeneca's complaints against the' individual
appellees are essentially identical; we quote representative
language from AstraZeneca's first amended complaint against
Apotex Corp., filed on April 30, 2010. J.A. 160-69.
[fn5] In deciding Appellees' motions to dismiss, the district
court held that it could consider certain documents beyond the
pleadings, including Appellees' ANDA filings, Section viii
statements, and proposed labeling. Astrazeneca , 2010 WL 5376310 , at *8-9. AstraZeneca complains that the district
court committed legal error by considering such documents
without allowing it to take discovery. However, the district
court was entitled to examine documents "integral to or
explicitly relied upon in the complaint" in evaluating motions
to dismiss. In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig. , 114 F.3d 1410 , 1426 (3d Cir. 1997). The district court
determined, and we agree, that AstraZeneca's complaints
referenced and relied on Appellees' FDA filings, and the
parties do not dispute the authenticity of the documents that
were before the court. We therefore see no error in the
district court's decision to consider these documents.
