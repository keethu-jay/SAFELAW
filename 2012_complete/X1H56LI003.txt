Before RILEY, Chief Judge, MELLOY and SHEPHERD, Circuit
Judges.
SHEPHERD, Circuit Judge.
Carl Whitney appeals the district court's affirmance of the
Social Security Commissioner's (Commissioner) decision to deny
him disability benefits and supplemental security income under
the Social Security Act (the Act). In this appeal, Whitney
claims that the district court should have found that he
submitted a medical report from Dr. Mary Ellen Ziolko to the
Appeals Council that was not considered and that his case
should therefore have been remanded to the Appeals Council for
consideration of the new and material evidence. We agree that
the district court should have determined whether Whitney
properly submitted the new evidence under 20 C.F.R. § 404.970 (b), and thus we remand this matter to the district
court to make that determination.
In August 2007, Whitney filed his application for disability
insurance benefits under Title II of the Act, 42 U.S.C. § 423 , and for supplemental security income under Title XVI of
the Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1382 . Whitney alleged disability due
to various physical conditions including arthritis, back and
neck pain, breathing problems, as well as mental deficiencies
and depression. After the initial denial and reconsideration,
an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) conducted a hearing on July
9, 2009, and issued a decision on September 9, 2009,
determining that Whitney was not disabled under the Act. As
relevant, the ALJ determined that the record did not establish
any mental impairment such as a cognitive or intelligence
quotient (IQ) deficiency.
On February 11, 2010, Whitney was seen by Dr. Mary Ellen
Ziolko, a psychologist. In a report, Dr. Ziolko determined that
Whitney had a full-scale IQ of 57 and fell in the mild
retardation range in reading, spelling, and arithmetic. She
also diagnosed him with a depressive disorder and assigned him
a Global Assessment Functioning score of 50.
Whitney contends that on February 19, 2010, he submitted Dr.
Ziolko's report to the Appeals Council via facsimile. However,
when the Appeals Council's decision denying Whitney's request
for review was issued on May 24, 2010, it failed to acknowledge
receipt of the report. The Appeals Council decision did,
however, recognize that it had received other additional
evidence that Whitney submitted after the ALJ issued his
decision.
In his appeal to the district court, Whitney argued that the
Appeals Council failed to consider Dr. Ziolko's report and
attached a copy of the [**2] report to his brief. Whitney also
attached a copy of the facsimile transmission report showing
that, at least according to his counsel's facsimile machine,
the report was received by the Appeals Council. Whitney's brief
to the district court went astray in arguing that "[t]o remand
a case, new evidence must be material, and there must be `good
cause for the failure to incorporate such evidence into the
record in a prior proceeding.' 42 U.S.C. § 405 (g)."
(Whitney's Br., Doc. 12, at 11.) However he also argued that
remand was appropriate under 20 C.F.R. § 404.976 (a)(1), 20 C.F.R. § 404.970 (b), [*1006] and Lamp v. Astrue , 531 F.3d 629 (8th Cir. 2008).
In response, the Commissioner addressed only whether remand was
appropriate under sentence six of 42 U.S.C. § 405 (g),
focusing largely on Whitney's failure to show good cause for
not submitting the report to the ALJ. The district court
likewise considered Dr. Ziolko's report only under 42 U.S.C. § 405 (g), holding Whitney "[did] not explain why the report
of Dr. Ziolko could not have been obtained in a timely fashion
. . . [and] [a]s a result, there is not good cause for
considering the report." (Order at 5.)
Before this court, Whitney acknowledges that his appeal brief
to the district court "could have been more articulate," but he
maintains that the basis for remand under the regulations was
stated and should have been considered by the district court.
The Commissioner responds that Whitney only requested relief
under 42 U.S.C. § 405 (g), and thus has waived any argument
on the regulations.
The regulation at issue provides:
If new and material evidence is submitted, the Appeals
  Council shall consider the additional evidence only
  where it relates to the period on or before the date
  of the administrative law judge hearing decision. The
  Appeals Council shall evaluate the entire record
  including the new and material evidence submitted if
  it relates to the period on or before the date of the
  administrative law judge hearing decision.
20 C.F.R. § 404.970 (b). [fn1]
"Under this regulation, if a claimant files additional medical
evidence with a request for review prior to the date of the
[Commissioner's] final decision, the Appeals Council MUST
consider the additional evidence if the additional evidence is
(a) new, (b) material, and (c) relates to the period on or
before the date of the ALJ's decision." Williams v. Sullivan , 905 F.2d 214 , 216 (8th Cir. 1990) (emphasis in
original). The Appeals Council's failure to consider the
evidence "may be a basis for remand by a reviewing court." Box v. Shalala , 52 F.3d 168 , 171 (8th Cir. 1995).
In Lamp , we addressed a similar situation. There, the
ALJ was concerned about an apparent conflict between the
treating physician's medical records and a separate letter the
physician submitted to the ALJ opining that the petitioner was
disabled. Lamp , 531 F.3d at 631 . Attempts by the ALJ
to contact the physician prior to issuance of a decision were
unsuccessful, but after the ALJ issued his opinion denying
benefits, petitioner submitted to the Appeals Council an
undated letter and a separate, dated letter from the treating
physician explaining the discrepancy between the treating notes
and his opinion of disability. Id . In its order
denying review, the Appeals Council noted that it had received
additional evidence [**3] and had made that part of the record in the
case, but the Appeals Council only referenced the dated letter
as having been received and considered. Id . We
determined that "the record clearly indicate[d] that
[petitioner's] attorney submitted th[e] undated letter along
with [the treating [*1007] physician's dated] statement," but we could not determine
"[w]hether the Appeals Council reviewed the undated letter when
it considered [the treating physician's dated] statement." Id. at 632 . Thus, we remanded the matter to the
district court with instructions to remand to the ALJ
"[b]ecause we [were] unable to discern whether the Appeals
Council considered this new and material evidence." Id. at 633 .
Whitney argued to the district court that he submitted new,
material evidence to the Appeals Council that was not
considered by the Appeals Council. In support, he attached a
copy of Dr. Ziolko's report along with a facsimile transmission
sheet showing that the facsimile transmitted correctly. The
district court did not consider whether the report had been
properly submitted under 20 C.F.R. § 404.970 (b). Rather the
court focused on whether the report could be considered under 42 U.S.C. § 405 (g) and determined that Whitney had failed
to show good cause for not submitting the report sooner.
The Commissioner's brief is silent on the question of whether
Whitney in fact timely submitted Dr. Ziolko's report to the
Appeals Council. Under questioning at oral argument, the
Commissioner refused to admit that the report was properly
submitted to the Appeals Council. The Commissioner does not
dispute, however, that under 20 C.F.R. § 404.970 (b), new,
material evidence may be submitted to the Appeals Council by
facsimile or that Whitney has supplied a transmission sheet
suggesting proper submission of the report. Instead, the
Commissioner argues, because there is no evidence of the report
in the administrative record, we should assume that the report
was not submitted and consider Whitney's request as being
brought only under 42 U.S.C. § 405 (g). As Whitney presented
his argument to the district court, it is in the proper
position to make the factual findings as to whether Dr.
Ziolko's report was submitted in a manner provided for under
the regulations.
Accordingly, we reverse and remand this matter to the district
court to make an initial determination of whether Whitney
timely submitted Dr. Ziolko's report to the Appeals Council as
required under 20 C.F.R. § 404.970 (b). If the district
court finds that the report was timely submitted, it is
directed to remand this matter to the Appeals Council for a
determination of whether the evidence is new, material, and
relates to the period on or before the ALJ's decision and, if
these requirements are found to have been satisfied, for
consideration with all of the other evidence in the
administrative record. See 20 C.F.R. §§ 404.970 (b), 404.976 (b)(1).
Reversed and remanded.
[fn1] We note that the regulations also provide:
The Appeals Council will consider all the evidence in
  the administrative law judge hearing record as well as
  any new and material evidence submitted to it which
  relates to the period on or before the date of the
  administrative law judge hearing decision. If you
  submit evidence which does not relate to the period on
  or before the date of the administrative law judge
  hearing decision, the Appeals Council will return the
  additional evidence to you with an explanation as to
  why it did not accept the additional evidence and will
  advise you of your right to file a new application.
20 C.F.R. § 404.976 (b)(1).
RILEY, Chief Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in
part.
I concur with the majority that this appeal should be
remanded to the district court for factual findings regarding
whether Whitney timely submitted Dr. Ziolko's report. Such
findings are essential to determine if Whitney has made "a
showing that there is new evidence which is material and [**4] that
there is good cause for the failure to incorporate such
evidence into the record in a prior proceeding" as required by 42 U.S.C. § 405 (g). If Whitney timely submitted the report,
as his facsimile report seems to suggest, and the Appeals
Council failed to consider it through no fault of Whitney's,
Whitney arguably has made the requisite showing of good cause
for the failure to incorporate the report into the
administrative record.
But I am unable to join the majority's opinion to the extent it
relies on Williams v. Sullivan , 905 F.2d 214 (8th
Cir. 1990) and its progeny to suggest the federal [*1008] courts have (1) jurisdiction independent of § 405(g) to
review the Appeals Council's compliance with its own
regulations in a nonfinal agency action, and (2) authority to
order remand to the Commissioner to consider additional
evidence absent a showing of good cause. Although it is
reasonable to conclude a disability claimant should have some
recourse to the federal courts to ensure the agency complies
with its own regulations, neither Whitney nor the panel in Williams has articulated a statutory basis for
jurisdiction in the federal courts independent of § 405(g) . [fn2] I respectfully dissent in this part of the
majority opinion.
[fn2] At oral argument, Whitney reasonably suggested
jurisdiction for such review may lie under the Administrative
Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 - 06 . But Whitney did not
even mention the APA in the district court or in his brief here
or attempt to explain whether the de novo review the court used
in Williams is the appropriate standard.
