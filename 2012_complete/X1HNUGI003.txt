Appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Texas.
Before KING, JOLLY and GRAVES, Circuit Judges.
KING, Circuit Judge:
Donnie Lee Roberts was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.
The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected both his direct and
postconviction appeals. He then filed for federal habeas relief in the
district court. The district court rejected his petition for habeas relief,
but granted him a certificate of appealability to pursue three claims
arising from his sentencing hearing dealing with, respectively, the
restrictions on his expert's testimony, the alleged ineffective assistance
of his trial counsel in failing to object to victim impact testimony, and
the restriction on execution impact testimony. Roberts's first claim is
procedurally defaulted and, alternatively, fails on the merits. His
ineffective assistance claim also fails on the merits, and his execution
impact claim is procedurally barred. We, therefore, AFFIRM the district
court's denial of habeas relief to Roberts.
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
The district court summarized the facts underlying Donnie Lee Roberts's
("Roberts") case as follows:
At the time of the murder, [Roberts] lived with the victim, Vicki
    Bowen. [Roberts] was unemployed, often drank alcohol, and used
    cocaine. Bowen worked as a dental assistant. On October 15, 2003,
    she went shopping with co-worker Brenda Bland, but she did not show
    up for work the next day. Because Bowen was a punctual person who
    always called if she was going to be late, Bland became concerned
    and went to Bowen's house to check on her. When Bland arrived at the
    home, she found the front door open. After knocking and receiving no
    answer, Bland entered the home and found Bowen dead. Bland noticed
    that Bowen was still in the scrubs she had worn at work the previous
    day. She was covered by a blanket and was lying face down with her
    head turned to the side in a pool of blood. Blood spatters were
    present in the living room on the coffee table, the couch, and the
    walls. The medical examiner would later determine that Bowen died
    from two gunshot wounds to the head.
It was immediately apparent from an examination of the scene that
    Bowen' [*2] s television and her son's truck were missing. That same day,
    the police found [Roberts] after tracking down the stolen truck. It
    was later determined that [Roberts] had taken the truck, the
    television, Texans/Titans football tickets, jewelry, a Western Union
    money order, a .22 rifle, and a .22 pistol. [Roberts] had sold the
    football tickets for one hundred dollars. He had bought cocaine from
    Edwin Gary on October 15 on three different occasions, the last of
    which involved trading the .22 caliber pistol. [Roberts] had
    apparently abandoned the .22 rifle, later determined to be the
    murder weapon, a few blocks from where he was found. The Western
    Union money order was found in the residence at which [Roberts] had
    parked his truck, but the television and the jewelry were never
    recovered.
[Roberts] was interviewed and gave a confession. In that
    confession, he acknowledged that he had "a crack cocaine problem"
    and that he would go to bars, get drunk, and then look for drugs.
    With regard to the victim's death, [Roberts] said, "I pointed the
    gun at her and I told her just give me some money."

    Later in the interview, [Roberts] stated: "I pointed the gun at her
    and I said, `if you'd just give me some money.' And she said `No.'
    And then I said, `Look, it doesn't have to be this way.' That's all
    I remember saying to her. And the next thing I know, I shot her."
At trial, [Roberts] testified to a different sequence of events.
    He claimed that he picked up the .22 rifle because it was out of
    place, near the door. He also claimed that he saw what looked like a
    .22 pistol in Bowen's pocket and that she moved her hand to her
    pocket to reach for it. He then said that he "must have chambered a
    round into the .22 rifle at that time," but he did not remember if
    he pulled the safety off. He also claimed that he did not remember
    his gun firing but that he knows it did. [Roberts] further testified
    that he did not intend to rob Bowen at the time he shot her, but he
    admitted to taking items of her property later.
Roberts v. Thaler , No. I:09cv419, 2011 WL 5433982, at *1-2 (E.D.Tex.
Nov.7, 2011) (citing Roberts v. State , 220 S.W.3d 521 , 524-25 (Tex.Crim.App.2007)).
Roberts was found guilty of capital murder on October 15, 2004, and,
following a subsequent sentencing hearing, was sentenced to death on October
27, 2004. Id . at *2. Roberts's conviction and sentence were both affirmed by
the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ("TCCA") on direct appeal. See Roberts , 220 S.W.3d at 524-25 . His petition for state postconviction relief was
denied, with the TCCA adopting most, but not all, of the lower court's
findings and conclusions. See Ex parte Roberts , Nos. 71, 573-01, 71, 573-02,
2009 WL 1337443, at *1 (Tex.Crim.App. May 13, 2009).
Roberts then filed for federal habeas relief in the district court for the
Eastern District of Texas, raising nineteen claims for relief. See Roberts ,
2011 WL 5433982, at *2-3. The district court rejected all of Roberts's
claims for habeas relief on a variety of procedural and substantive grounds
on November 7, 2011. Id. at *26. On December 7, 2011, the district court
granted Roberts a certificate of appealability ("COA") to continue to pursue
three of his claims before this court: (1) that his right to be free from
cruel and unusual punishment was violated when the trial court refused to [*3] let his expert testify during Roberts's sentencing that Roberts's combined
use of alcohol and cocaine caused him to commit the capital murder; (2) that
he was denied the effective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel
failed to object during the sentencing hearing to testimony that Roberts
alleges was improper victim impact evidence from an extraneous crime; and
(3) that his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment was violated
when the trial court refused to allow testimony from Roberts's family member
as to how his execution would impact her. We first address the proper
standard of review under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act
("AEDPA"), 28 U.S.C. § 2254 , and then resolve each of Roberts's claims in
turn.
II. DISCUSSION
A. Standard of Review
The district court's grant of a COA to Roberts gives us jurisdiction to
review his claims. See 28 U.S.C. § 2253 (c); Miller-El v. Cockrell , 537 U.S. 322 , 335-36 , 123 S.Ct. 1029 , 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). "In an appeal
of the district court's denial of habeas relief, `this court reviews the
district court's findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo , applying the same standard of review that the district court
applied to the state court decision.'" Austin v. Cain , 660 F.3d 880 , 884 (5th Cir.2011) (quoting Jones v. Cain , 600 F.3d 527 , 535 (5th Cir.2010)).

Roberts's appeal is governed by AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. § 2254 . Under § 2254(d)(1) ,
if the state court denied the petitioner's claim on the merits, a federal
court may grant habeas corpus relief only if the state court's adjudication
of his claim "resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an
unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined
by the Supreme Court of the United States. . . ." To be clear, "a federal
habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in
its independent judgment that the relevant state-court decision applied
clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather, that
application must also be unreasonable." Williams v. Taylor , 529 U.S. 362 , 411 , 120 S.Ct. 1495 , 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (emphasis added); see also Harrington v. Richter , ___ U.S. ___ , 131 S.Ct. 770 , 786 , 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) ("It bears repeating that even a strong case for relief does not mean
the state court's contrary conclusion was unreasonable."). "A state court's
decision is contrary to clearly established federal law if it applies a rule
that contradicts the governing law set forth in Supreme Court cases . . . or
if the state court decide[s] a case differently than the United States
Supreme Court previously decided a case on a set of nearly identical facts." Jones , 600 F.3d at 535 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
Similarly, "[a] state court's decision involves an unreasonable application
of clearly established federal law if the state court `correctly identifies
the governing legal rule but applies it unreasonably to the facts of a
particular prisoner's case.'" Fields v. Thaler , 588 F.3d 270 , 273 (5th
Cir.2009) (quoting Williams , 529 U.S. at 407-08 , 120 S.Ct. 1495 ).
AEDPA also governs our review of factual determinations. See Chester v. Thaler , 666 F.3d 340 , 348 (5th Cir.2011). Under § 2254(e)(1) , the state
court's factual findings are accorded a presumption of correctness and the
petitioner may only rebut this presumption with clear and convincing
evidence. See Miller-El v. Dretke [*4] , 545 U.S. 231 , 240 , 125 S.Ct. 2317 , 162 L.Ed.2d 196 (2005). Moreover, we may not grant habeas relief unless the
state court determination "was based on an unreasonable determination of the
facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding." 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (d)(2).
Finally, we may not review a habeas claim "if the last state court to
consider that claim expressly relied on a state ground for denial of relief
that is both independent of the merits of the federal claim and an adequate basis for the court's decision." Finley v. Johnson , 243 F.3d 215 , 218 (5th
Cir.2001) (emphasis added). Thus, "[a]s a rule, a state prisoner's habeas
claims may not be entertained by a federal court when (1) a state court
[has] declined to address [those] claims because the prisoner had failed to
meet a state procedural requirement, and (2) the state judgment rests on
independent and adequate state procedural grounds." Maples v. Thomas , ___ U.S. ___ , 132 S.Ct. 912 , 922 , 181 L.Ed.2d 807 (2012) (citation and
internal quotation marks). The twin requirements of independence and
adequacy demand that the state court's dismissal must "`clearly and
expressly' indicate that it rests on state grounds which bar relief, and the
bar must be strictly or regularly followed by state courts, and applied to
the majority of similar claims." Finley , 243 F.3d at 218 (quoting Amos v. Scott , 61 F.3d 333 , 338-39 (5th Cir.1995)). Put differently, "[t]o produce a
federally cognizable default, the state procedural rule `must have been
`firmly established and regularly

followed' by the time as of which it is to be applied.'" Busby v. Dretke , 359 F.3d 708 , 718 (5th Cir.2004) (quoting Ford v. Georgia , 498 U.S. 411 , 424 , 111 S.Ct. 850 , 112 L.Ed.2d 935 (1991)). A petitioner may not overcome a
procedural default based on independent and adequate state grounds, unless
the prisoner can establish cause for the default and actual prejudice as a
result of the alleged violation of federal law, or that the failure to
consider his claims would result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice
because he is "actually innocent" of the offense underlying his conviction
or "actually innocent" of the death penalty. Williams v. Thaler , 602 F.3d 291 , 307 (5th Cir.2010) (citing Schlup v. Delo , 513 U.S. 298 , 326-27 , 115 S.Ct. 851 , 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995); Sawyer v. Whitley , 505 U.S. 333 , 340 , 112 S.Ct. 2514 , 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992)). While our normal
procedure is to consider issues of procedural default first, we may
nonetheless opt to examine the merits first, especially when procedural
default turns on difficult questions of state law. Busby , 359 F.3d at 720 .
B. Roberts's First Claim: The Limitation on His Expert's Testimony
Roberts's first claim is that his rights under the Eighth Amendment were
violated when the trial court refused to allow his expert, Dr. Katherine
McQueen ("Dr. McQueen"), to testify that it was Roberts's combined use of
alcohol and crack cocaine that caused him to commit the capital murder. The
trial court held a pre-sentencing evidentiary hearing to determine what the
scope of Dr. McQueen's testimony would be. Roberts , 220 S.W.3d at 527-28 .
Upon reviewing Dr. McQueen's qualifications, the basis for her testimony,
and arguments from both sides, the trial court determined that Dr. McQueen
could not give her "opinion about whether [Roberts's addiction to cocaine
and alcohol] had some bearing on th[e] offense." Id. at 529 . Dr. McQueen was
permitted to testify that there was statistical evidence showing a
correlation between the [*5] combined use of alcohol and cocaine and violence,
that this relationship was stronger when both drugs were ingested together
rather than individually, and that Roberts was addicted to both. Id . However, during the sentencing hearing itself, Roberts's counsel attempted
to ask Dr. McQueen, "[W]as there some or is there some relationship to
Donnie Roberts'[s] dependence on alcohol, dependence on cocaine, dependence
on a combination thereto in relationship to the events of the [day of the
murder]?" Id. at 529-30 . The prosecution objected and the objection was
sustained. Id. at 530 .
On direct appeal before the TCCA, Roberts argued that, by not permitting
Dr. McQueen to testify that his combined use of alcohol and drugs caused him
to commit the offense, the trial court excluded constitutionally relevant
mitigating evidence. Id. at 528 . The TCCA first noted that Roberts's "brief
fails to address the reason the trial court did exclude the evidence: that
appellant had failed to make the requisite showing of reliability under
[Texas] Rule [of Evidence] 702 ." Id . [fn1] "Consequently,

"the TCCA concluded, "[Roberts]'s briefing is inadequate, and his point of
error is subject to rejection on that ground alone." Id . On this point, the
TCCA cited to Texas Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.1 , which, inter alia ,
provides that "[t]he brief must contain a clear and concise argument for the
contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the
record." TEX.R.APP. PROC. 38.1(i) . However, the TCCA then stated,
"Nevertheless, we turn to the merits." Roberts , 220 S.W.3d at 528 . The TCCA
proceeded to reject Roberts's claim on the merits, id. at 528-31, holding
that "the trial court could reasonably conclude that [Dr. McQueen's]
pharmacological knowledge and [previous] studies were not a sufficient basis
from which to draw a scientific conclusion about how any particular
individual would behave." Id. at 530. The district court noted that the TCCA
rejected Roberts's claim on procedural grounds, but apparently did not agree
with its reasoning: "The parties have not cited, and this Court has not
found, authority holding that the rule forbidding inadequate briefing is
strictly or regularly applied evenhandedly to the vast majority of similar
claims. In light of this uncertainty, the Court finds it easier to resolve
this claim on its merits." Roberts , 2011 WL 5433982, at *14. The district
court then considered Roberts's claim on the merits and concluded that "the
state court's rejection of this claim was neither contrary to, nor the
result of an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law,
as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States in Tennard [and] Barefoot. . . ." Id. at 16.
While the TCCA may well have disposed of Roberts's claim on grounds of
procedural default, its analysis was brief and a credible argument could be
made that the TCCA was merely noting — rather than holding — that Roberts's
claim was inadequately briefed and thus could be "subject to rejection on
that ground alone." Roberts , 220 S.W.3d at 527 . If the TCCA did find
Roberts's claim procedurally barred, then we must first consider whether
this conclusion precludes [*6] review of the substance of his habeas claim. See Rocha v. Thaler , 619 F.3d 387 , 400 (5th Cir.2010). Given that the TCCA
"clearly and expressly" relied on Texas's rule regarding adequate briefing
in disposing of Roberts's claim on this procedural ground, Finley , 243 F.3d at 218 , we must examine the TCCA's application of this rule in
previous cases. We have not had occasion to consider this issue within our
circuit. [fn2]
A survey of the TCCA's capital sentencing jurisprudence reveals that it
regularly rejects claims, both on direct and postconviction review, on the
basis that these claims are inadequately briefed. See, e.g., Leza v. State , 351 S.W.3d 344 , 358 (Tex.Crim.App.2011) ("The appellant directs us to
nowhere in the record where any such complaints were registered in the trial
court, nor have we found any. Nor does he now offer any justification for
treating these arguments as immune from ordinary principles of procedural
default, in contemplation of the framework for error preservation. . . . For
this reason, we regard his arguments under this point of error as
inadequately briefed and decline to reach their merits.") (footnotes
omitted); Lucio v. State , 351 S.W.3d 878 , 896 (Tex.Crim.App.2011)
("Appellant's brief contains no argument or citation to any authority that
might support an argument that if she is guilty, she is guilty only of
injury to a child. . . . We decide that this point of error is inadequately
briefed and presents nothing for review as this Court is under no obligation
to make appellant's arguments for her."); Murphy v. State , 112 S.W.3d 592 , 596 (Tex.Crim.App.2003) ("[B]ecause appellant does not argue that the Texas
Constitution provides, or should provide, greater or different protection
than its federal counterpart, appellant's point of error is inadequately
briefed."); Salazar v. State , 38 S.W.3d 141 , 147 (Tex.Crim.App.2001)
(dismissing multiple claims on grounds that "[a]ppellant has briefed these
points together, but his brief presents no authority in support of his
argument"); Heitman v. State , 815 S.W.2d 681 , 690 n. 23 (Tex.Crim.App.1991)
("We do not, by this opinion, retreat from our [prior] pronouncement . . .
that briefs asserting rights under Article I , Sec. 10 of the Texas
Constitution were inadequate if they did not provide either argument or
authority in support of that assertion.").
While the district court was correct to note that we have not decided
whether Texas's rule regarding inadequate briefing in the capital context
constitutes a valid procedural bar to federal habeas relief, we hold now
that under the prevailing standards, Texas's rules have been "regularly
followed by [its] courts, and applied to the majority of similar claims." Finley , 243 F.3d at 218 . Other district courts in our jurisdiction have held
as much. See, e.g., Woodard v. Thaler , 702 F.Supp.2d 738 , 750-51 & n. 9
(S.D.Tex.2010). [fn3] Our sister courts of appeal, in addressing analogous
provisions from other states, have likewise found them to act as independent
and adequate state procedural bars. See House v. Hatch , 527 F.3d 1010 , 1029-30 (10th Cir.2008) (holding that New Mexico's requirement of adequate
briefing is an independent and adequate procedural bar to federal habeas
relief); Clay v. Norris , 485 F.3d 1037 , 1040-41 (8th Cir.2007) (holding that
Arkansas's proper abstracting rule is

an independent and adequate procedural [*7] bar to federal habeas relief).
In this case, if the TCCA did invoke the briefing requirements of Texas
Rule of Appellate Procedure 38.1 to bar Roberts's claim, then its
determination constituted an independent and adequate state ground for
denial of relief that procedurally bars federal habeas review. Moreover,
Roberts cannot show any cause for his default nor does he claim that any
miscarriage of justice would result from enforcing such a bar. See Coleman v. Thompson , 501 U.S. 722 , 750 , 111 S.Ct. 2546 , 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991).
Consequently, we disagree with the district court's determination that
Roberts's inadequate briefing does not pose a bar to federal habeas review.
However, because a credible argument could be made that the TCCA did not
expressly bar Roberts's claim, we also consider the merits of his claim.
Roberts concedes that Dr. McQueen was permitted to testify that Roberts was
addicted to alcohol and cocaine, and that there is "a very strong connection
between substance use and dependence and violent acts and, in particular,
between dependence on both alcohol and cocaine and violent acts." Roberts , 220 S.W.3d at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, Roberts
appears to take issue with the TCCA's conclusion, adopted by the district
court, that "the trial court [did not] err[] when it decided to prevent Dr.
McQueen from taking the extra step of opining whether alcohol and drug
dependence was related to [Roberts]'s violent conduct" on the night of the
murder. Id . Roberts argues that this restriction left Dr. McQueen's
testimony "in the abstract and not personal so that the jury could give
effect to the mitigating evidence that `reduced the defendant's moral
blameworthiness' as contemplated in Tennard [v. Dretke , 542 U.S. 274 , 124 S.Ct. 2562 , 159 L.Ed.2d 384 (2004)]."
Roberts's argument appears to rest on both Tennard — where the Court held
that the Eighth Amendment requires that the jury be able to consider and
give meaningful effect to a capital defendant's mitigating evidence — and Barefoot v. Estelle , 463 U.S. 880 , 103 S.Ct. 3383 , 77 L.Ed.2d 1090 (1983) —
where the Court refused to enact a constitutional per se bar to expert
testimony regarding a defendant's future dangerousness. But neither case,
either individually or in combination, supports Roberts's claim. The jury
was not prevented from giving meaningful effect to the testimony of Dr.
McQueen; rather, Dr. McQueen was prevented from specifically stating that
Roberts's dependence on drugs and alcohol caused him to commit the homicide.
This restriction came after Dr. McQueen was unable to show any reliable
basis for such testimony, being unable to cite any specific scientific
research for her conclusions. Roberts , 220 S.W.3d at 528-29 . Nonetheless,
Dr. McQueen was permitted to testify broadly and the jury was fully entitled
to draw Roberts's preferred inference that drugs and alcohol were mitigating
factors in the crime after hearing Dr. McQueen's testimony. We see no
unreasonable application of Tennard by the TCCA in upholding the trial
court's limitation on Dr. McQueen's testimony.
Moreover, Roberts has shown no unreasonable application of Barefoot. Dr.
McQueen was permitted to testify about Roberts's drug and alcohol addiction [*8] and the relationship of such an addiction to violent behavior. Indeed,
Roberts was permitted to present the testimony of a second expert confirming
the impact of Roberts's cocaine and alcohol addiction on his psychology and
opining that Roberts would not pose a future danger. Barefoot stands for the proposition that expert testimony predicting a defendant's
future dangerousness is not per se inadmissible. See Barefoot , 463 U.S. at 896-97 , 103 S.Ct. 3383 (explaining that because future
dangerousness "is a constitutionally acceptable criterion for imposing the
death penalty," and it is "not impossible for even a lay person sensibly to
arrive at that conclusion, it makes little sense, if any, to submit that
psychiatrists, out of the entire universe of persons who might have an
opinion on the issue, would know so little about the subject that they
should not be permitted to testify"). [fn4] Barefoot does not require that any mitigating testimony that might be offered by an expert be admitted into
evidence. Accordingly, the TCCA did not unreasonably apply federal law when
it affirmed the trial court's restrictions on Dr. McQueen's testimony.
In sum, Roberts's claim is both procedurally barred and fails on the
merits. Consequently, we affirm the district court's denial of habeas relief
on this claim.
C. Roberts's Second Claim: Ineffective Assistance of Counsel
Roberts's second claim on appeal is that he was denied the effective
assistance of counsel when his trial lawyer failed to object to testimony
from the victim of a robbery that Roberts previously committed. See Roberts ,
2011 WL 5433982, at *16. To provide the setting, at the sentencing phase of
Roberts's trial, the State introduced evidence of a series of Roberts's
prior offenses, including a confession to law enforcement officers that he
had committed a previous murder and a confession that he had badly injured
his brother on his brother's wedding night. As part of this evidence, the
prosecution called Elizabeth Thomas, the victim of a robbery by Roberts, to
testify about the robbery and the anxieties and emotional problems that the
robbery had caused her. Roberts , 220 S.W.3d at 531 . [fn5] The testimony about
Roberts's prior offenses was followed by testimony from the mother, father,
and son of the victim for whose death Roberts was on trial about the impact
of the murder on them. On direct appeal to the TCCA, Roberts contended that
Thomas's testimony about the impact of Roberts's robbery on her life was
improper victim impact evidence under the TCCA's holding in Cantu v. State , 939 S.W.2d 627 , 637 (Tex.Crim.App.1997), and that counsel should have
objected to its introduction. The TCCA disagreed that Thomas's testimony
constituted improper victim impact evidence, explaining that "`[v]ictim
impact' evidence is evidence of the effect of an offense on people other
than the victim. . . . [and] [t]he evidence presented here was evidence of
the effect on a different offense on the victim (of the extraneous offense).
. . ." Roberts , 220 S.W.3d at 531 (footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).
The TCCA then concluded that the evidence was admissible and "even if it
weren't, counsel was not ineffective for failing [*9] to lodge an objection based
upon a case that is clearly distinguishable from the present case." Id. The
district court surveyed Cantu and other cases dealing with this class of
evidence and concluded that the TCCA's position was not unreasonable because
"Roberts's trial counsel

could reasonably have believed, based upon state court precedent, that
objecting to the admission of the victim impact evidence in his case would
have been futile." Roberts , 2011 WL 5433982, at *20.
Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are governed by the standards
laid out in Strickland v. Washington :
First, the defendant must show that counsel's performance was
    deficient. . . . Second, the defendant must show that the deficient
    performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that
    counsel's errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a
    fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant
    makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death
    sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that
    renders the result unreliable.
466 U.S. 668 , 687 , 104 S.Ct. 2052 , 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In order to
satisfy the performance prong, "the defendant must show that counsel's
representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness." Id . at
688, 104 S.Ct. 2052 . "The proper measure of attorney performance remains
simply reasonableness under prevailing professional norms." Id.; see also Wiggins v. Smith , 539 U.S. 510 , 521 , 123 S.Ct. 2527 , 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003). Strickland's second prong focuses on the result of counsel's deficient
performance: "When a defendant challenges a death sentence . . ., the
question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the
errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded that the balance of
aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death." Id. at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052 . In this context, "[a] reasonable probability is a
probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome." Id. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052 , 104 S.Ct. 2052 . Put differently, "[i]n assessing prejudice
under Strickland , the question is not whether a court can be certain
counsel's performance had no effect on the outcome or whether it is possible
a reasonable doubt might have been established if counsel acted differently.
. . . Instead, Strickland asks whether it is `reasonably likely' the result
would have been different." Harrington v. Richter , ___ U.S. ___ , 131 S.Ct. 770 , 791-92 , 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted). Thus, Strickland demands that the likelihood of a
different result "must be substantial, not just conceivable." Id. at 792 .
However, this two-prong standard is itself subject to the dictates of
AEDPA. "Surmounting Strickland's high bar is never an easy task. . . .
Establishing that a state court's application of Strickland was unreasonable
under § 2254(d) is all the more difficult. The standards created by Strickland and § 2254(d) are both highly deferential, . . . and when the two
apply in tandem, review is doubly so. . . ." Premo v. Moore , ___ U.S. ___ , 131 S.Ct. 733 , 739-40 , 178 L.Ed.2d 649 (2011) (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court has admonished that "[f]ederal
habeas courts must guard against the danger of equating unreasonableness
under Strickland with unreasonableness under § 2254(d) . When § 2254(d) applies, the question [*10] is not whether counsel's actions were reasonable. The
question is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland's deferential standard." Id. at 740 (emphasis added); see also Harrington , 131 S.Ct. at 785 ("The pivotal question is whether the state
court's application of the Strickland standard was unreasonable. This is
different from asking whether defense counsel's performance fell below Strickland's standard. . . . A state court must be granted a deference and
latitude that are not in operation

when the case involves review under the Strickland standard itself.").
In the instant case, the key issue is whether Roberts's trial counsel was
ineffective in failing to object to the testimony of a victim of an
extraneous offense. We "ha[ve] made clear that counsel is not required to
make futile motions or objections." Koch v. Puckett , 907 F.2d 524 , 527 (5th
Cir.1990) (citing Murray v. Maggio , 736 F.2d 279 , 283 (5th Cir.1984) (per
curiam)). Accordingly, if any objection by Roberts's trial counsel would
have been futile, then the failure to object would not fall below the
difficult standard enunciated above.
Determining whether an objection would have been futile depends on the
state of the law regarding victim impact evidence. To be clear, the Eighth
Amendment does not per se bar the introduction of victim impact evidence in
capital cases. See Payne v. Tennessee , 501 U.S. 808 , 827 , 111 S.Ct. 2597 , 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991). Rather, the germane constitutional prohibition
restricts the introduction of "evidence . . . that is so unduly prejudicial
that it renders the trial fundamentally unfair" and violates the Due Process
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. at 825 , 111 S.Ct. 2597 . However, the
Court left questions about the relevancy of such evidence to the states. Id.
at 826-29 , 111 S.Ct. 2597 .
In a series of cases beginning with Ford v. State , 919 S.W.2d 107 (Tex.Crim.App.1996), the TCCA set about fleshing out this standard. [fn6] Most relevant for our purposes is Mathis v. State , 67 S.W.3d 918 (Tex.Crim.App.2002), where the TCCA confronted a situation in which a
defendant had shot three people, killing one and leaving another
quadriplegic, but the defendant was on trial only for the murder. Id. at
927 . At the defendant's sentencing, the State called the nurse of the
paralyzed victim to discuss the victim's medical care needs. Id. at 928 . The
TCCA allowed the evidence, explaining:
Unlike in [previous cases], in which the evidence involved
    testimony regarding both the victim's good qualities and the effect
    that her death had on family members, the testimony in the present case did not involve testimony about how third persons were affected by the crime, nor was there any discussion about the character of the victim. [The nurse]'s testimony focused solely on the medical
    procedures involved in the care of [the victim]. Appellant's
    characterization of [the nurse]'s testimony as victim impact
    evidence is incorrect.
Id. at 928 (emphasis added). Mathis and its reasoning figured prominently
in shaping two later TCCA decisions. In Guevara v. State , 97 S.W.3d 579 , 583-84 (Tex.Crim.App.2003), the TCCA held that the testimony of a victim of
an extraneous

offense about the impact of that offense on another victim's mental
impairment was permissible [*11] under Mathis. The TCCA further expanded on this
reasoning in Garcia v. State , 126 S.W.3d 921 , 929 (Tex. Crim.App.2004), when
confronted with the prosecution's attempt to introduce medical records from
a bystander wounded in the defendant's shooting of a police officer:
In Mathis v. State . . . we stated that "victim impact evidence"
    is "generally recognized as evidence concerning the effect that the
    victim's death will have on others, particularly the victim's family
    members." Appellant mischaracterizes Luna's medical records as
    victim impact evidence. The records did not reveal anything about
    Luna's good character or how third persons were affected by the
    death of the victim named in the indictment (the police officer).
    The records reflected in the most technical terms Luna's medical
    condition while in the hospital. While the records might have been
    irrelevant or inadmissible for other reasons, they were not
    irrelevant or inadmissible because they were victim impact evidence,
    as appellant claims.
This was the state of Texas law at the time of Roberts's trial in
2004. [fn7] Under AEDPA, we must ask "whether there is any reasonable
argument that counsel satisfied Strickland's deferential standard," Premo , 131 S.Ct. at 740 , given the above legal framework and our holding that the
failure to lodge futile objections does not qualify as ineffective
assistance. Koch , 907 F.2d at 527 . Roberts seeks to persuade us that there
is no such argument given that three of the TCCA's judges dissented from the
majority's finding that the facts of Roberts's case differed from those of Cantu. Roberts , 220 S.W.3d at 535-36 (Meyers, J., dissenting). But the
dissent of some judges does not mean that no reasonable argument could be
made supporting the TCCA's conclusion that Roberts's trial counsel concluded
that Cantu was "clearly distinguishable" from Roberts's situation. Id. at
531. Indeed, the TCCA cited Mathis, Guevara , and Garcia — all cases that
highlighted the fact that Cantu's holding did not apply to testimony dealing
with the impact of an extraneous offense on a victim of that extraneous
offense — to this effect. Id. at 531 n. 25. It would not have been an
unreasonable application of Strickland to conclude, as the TCCA and the
district court did, that any objection by Roberts's trial counsel would have
been futile in light of the TCCA's post- Cantu "victim impact" jurisprudence. See Adams v. Thaler , 421 Fed. Appx. 322 , 332-34 (5th Cir.2011) ("[Appellate]
counsel could have reasonably concluded that pursuing the argument that
[the] . . . testimony [of a victim injured during the capital offense but
whose injuries were not part of the capital indictment] was inadmissible
would have been futile in light of the TCCA's holding in Mathis that certain
testimony about a victim injured in the same criminal episode is
admissible.").
Our conclusion is bolstered by AEDPA's standard of review. We are not
reviewing the TCCA's evaluation of its own precedents, but instead applying Strickland's deferential standard under the auspices of AEDPA. And under
AEDPA, "[a] state `court must be granted a deference and latitude that are
not in operation when the case involves review under the Strickland [*12] standard
itself." Harrington , 131 S.Ct. at 785 .
We affirm the district court's denial of relief on Roberts's second claim
on appeal.
D. Roberts's Third Claim: Execution Impact Testimony
The third claim that Roberts received a COA for and raises on appeal is
that the trial court violated his right to be free from cruel and unusual
punishment when it denied his niece the opportunity to testify about how his
execution would impact her. See Roberts , 2011 WL 5433982, at *23. When
Roberts proposed to ask his niece about the impact of his execution on her,
the prosecution objected and the trial court upheld the objection. Roberts , 220 S.W.3d at 532 . Roberts did not make an offer of proof as to what his
niece's testimony would have been. Id . The TCCA concluded that Roberts
failed to preserve this error by failing to make an offer of proof, and that
the state trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding this
testimony. Id. The district court found Roberts's claim to be procedurally
defaulted and that Roberts had not argued that he fell within any of the
relevant exceptions. Roberts , 2011 WL 5433982, at *23. Thus, the district
court dismissed his claim with prejudice. Id.
We first consider the question of procedural default. The requirement of
an offer of proof comes from Texas Rule of Evidence 103(a)(2), which
provides that "[e]rror may not be predicated upon a ruling which . . .
excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected, and .
. . the substance of the evidence was made known to the court by offer, or
was apparent from the context within which questions were asked." [fn8] A
short statement by counsel or even a brief question-and-answer with the
witness will satisfy the offer of proof requirement. Mays v. State , 285 S.W.3d 884 , 889-90 (Tex.Crim.App.2009). The requirement may also be
satisfied if "the substance of the evidence is apparent from the context
within which the questions were asked." Fairow v. State , 943 S.W.2d 895 , 897 n. 2 (Tex.Crim.App.1997).
In the present case, the TCCA clearly and expressly relied on Rule
103(a)(2) in adjudicating Roberts's claim. The relevant question, then, is
whether the TCCA has applied this procedural requirement "strictly or
regularly" in "the majority of similar claims" in the capital context. Finley , 243 F.3d at 218 . A survey of the TCCA's capital jurisprudence
reveals consistent application in capital cases. See, e.g., Mays , 285 S.W.3d at 891 ("Because the appellant failed to make a proper offer of
proof, we hold that he did not preserve his complaint for appeal."); Fairow , 943 S.W.2d at 897 n. 2 ("While it is true that appellant made no offer of
proof indicating [the witness]'s answers to the questions, the substance of
the evidence is apparent from the context within which the questions were
asked."); Williams v. State , 937 S.W.2d 479 , 489 (Tex.Crim.App.1996)
("Moreover, appellant failed to make an

offer of proof. To preserve error regarding the exclusion of evidence, an
offer of proof is required."); Chambers v. State , 866 S.W.2d 9 , 27 (Tex.Crim.App.1993) (" Rule 103(a)(2) of the Rules of [] Evidence require
that when evidence is excluded the proponent establish the substance of the
excluded evidence by making on offer of proof. . . . Appellant wholly failed
to explain why this evidence should have been permitted and what he hoped to
establish with [*13] the evidence.") (citations omitted).
Moreover, we have previously made clear that the failure to preserve an
issue for appeal by failing to make a proper offer of proof constitutes an
independent and adequate procedural bar. See Wheat v. Johnson , 238 F.3d 357 , 360 (5th Cir.2001) ("We agree with the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals that
the offer of proof was not properly preserved. . . . [Petitioner] makes no
attempt on appeal to show either cause or prejudice for this procedural
default; he is therefore barred from now bringing the claim on federal
habeas review."). In his brief before us, Roberts does not attempt to show
cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice, nor can we
discern either exception.
Consequently, we affirm the district court's conclusion that Roberts's
execution impact claim is procedurally barred.
III. CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court's denial of habeas
relief to Roberts.
[fn1] Texas Rule of Evidence 702 provides that "[i]f scientific, technical,
or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand
the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an
expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify
thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise." In the capital context, Kelly v. State , 824 S.W.2d 568 (Tex.Crim.App.1992), provides the governing
standard for evaluating the relevance and reliability of expert testimony.
Roberts's brief before the TCCA noted that "the trial court would not allow
[his expert] to give her ultimate opinion that [Roberts's] drug use caused
Roberts to commit the crime in this case." Roberts only referred to the
issue of relevancy when he stated, without providing any citations, that
"[s]uch evidence [as it relates to the circumstances of the particular
offense] is . . . so highly relevant according to the Supreme Court that it
may not be excluded." Roberts may have been attempting to argue, relying on Lockett v. Ohio , 438 U.S. 586 , 98 S.Ct. 2954 , 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978), and Tennard v. Dretke , 542 U.S. 274 , 124 S.Ct. 2562 , 159 L.Ed.2d 384 (2004),
that state relevancy requirements must yield to the constitutional guarantee
that "the [capital] sentencing process must permit consideration of the
character and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the
particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process
of inflicting the penalty of death." Lockett , 438 U.S. at 601 , 98 S.Ct. 2954 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). But Roberts never actually
made this point before the state courts — at least not with any clarity —
nor did he cite to any of the relevant Texas statutes or cases that govern
this area of law. Indeed, Roberts makes no reference to procedural default
in his briefing on this claim before this court.
[fn2] This court has encountered inadequate briefing as a form of procedural
default in habeas cases arising from the Texas courts, but has either not
had occasion to consider it directly or has only addressed it in the COA
context. In Salazar v. Dretke , 419 F.3d 384 , 395-96 (5th Cir.2005), this
court confronted a situation where the TCCA had rejected a petitioner's
argument on procedural grounds of inadequate briefing. However, the district
court concluded that the State had failed to invoke the procedural bar
doctrine before the trial court and had abandoned this claim on appeal. Id. at 395 n. 20. Accordingly, the panel did not address this issue. In Heiselbetz v. Johnson , No. 98-1474, 1999 WL 642862, at *6 (5th Cir. July 26,
1999), an applicant for a COA was denied the certificate on a claim that the
TCCA concluded was inadequately briefed. The panel concluded that the
applicant had failed to "make a credible showing that his claim [wa]s not
procedurally barred." Id.
[fn3] One exception is Oliver v. Dretke , No. 1:04CV041, 2005 WL 2403751, at
*9 (E.D.Tex. Sept. 29, 2005), where the court found that "[i]t is not clear
that Rule 38.1 has been so consistently applied as to constitute an adequate
and independent state ground for decision, [and so] the Court finds that the
issue has not been procedurally defaulted." The district court provided
nothing — neither citations nor reasoning — beyond this bald statement. Such
conclusory statements are unpersuasive.
[fn4] Moreover, as the district court properly observed, there are questions
about the ongoing vitality of Barefoot in the wake of Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals , 509 U.S. 579 , 113 S.Ct. 2786 , 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). See Flores v. Johnson , 210 F.3d 456 , 464-66 (5th Cir.2000) (Garza, J.,
concurring).
[fn5] The State also had two experts testify that Roberts suffered from
various psychological disorders and would pose a future danger.
[fn6] Initially, the TCCA drew on Payne in concluding that certain kinds of
victim impact evidence might plausibly be relevant to a defendant's moral
culpability for capital murder. Ford , 919 S.W.2d at 115-16 . The next year,
however, in Cantu v. State , the TCCA circumscribed this ruling. In Cantu ,
the defendant was involved in the murder of two teenage girls, but was
initially tried for one of the murders. Cantu , 939 S.W.2d at 631 . During his
capital sentencing hearing, the prosecution introduced the testimony of the
mother of the victim not named in the indictment. Id. at 635-36 . The TCCA
held that it was error for the trial court to admit this evidence as "[t]he
danger of unfair prejudice to a defendant inherent in the introduction of
`victim impact' evidence with respect to a victim not named in the
indictment on which he is being tried is unacceptably high." Id. at 637 .
Such evidence was irrelevant and inadmissible for the purposes of capital
sentencing, the TCCA concluded, effectively combining both inquiries. Id . Cantu's reach has, in turn, been circumscribed by the decisions we describe
below.
[fn7] The TCCA later handed down its opinion in Mays v. State , 318 S.W.3d 368 , 393 (Tex.Crim.App.2010), in which it upheld the
admissibility in a capital sentencing of the testimony of two officers
involved in a police shootout but who were not named as victims of the
crimes for which defendants were tried because they testified regarding
their own injuries and the losses in their lives. While Mays is directly on
point with the situation facing Roberts, it was decided after Roberts's
trial and so cannot be cited for the proposition that any objection by
Roberts's trial counsel would have been futile. Naturally, "there is no
general duty on the part of defense counsel to anticipate changes in the
law." Green v. Johnson , 116 F.3d 1115 , 1125 (5th Cir.1997). However, counsel
should endeavor to "present solid, meritorious arguments based on directly
controlling precedent." Ries v. Quarterman , 522 F.3d 517 , 532 (5th Cir.2008)
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
[fn8] The TCCA also cited its decision in Jackson v. State , 33 S.W.3d 828 , 838 (Tex.Crim.App.2000), in holding that the trial court did not abuse its
discretion by excluding Roberts's execution impact testimony.
