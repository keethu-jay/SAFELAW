JUDGMENT ORDER
D. MICHAEL FISHER, Circuit Judge.
Alfredo Gasca-Chavez appeals his judgment of conviction and sentence on
the basis that 18 U.S.C. § 922 (g)(5) is unconstitutional on its face and/or
as applied to the facts of this case. Gasca-Chavez concedes that his
argument is foreclosed by binding Third Circuit precedent, and he raises the
issue on appeal solely to preserve it for Supreme Court review.
The judgment of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania entered April 1, 2011, is hereby affirmed.
