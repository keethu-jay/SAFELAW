Before: WINTER, JOHN M. WALKER, JR., and CABRANES, Circuit Judges.
JOSÉ A. CABRANES, Circuit Judge:
This is the fourth in a series of recent cases to come before us
challenging New York State second-degree murder convictions on grounds that
the evidence presented to the jury could support only a conviction for
intentional murder under N.Y. Penal Law § 125.25 (1), and not "depraved
indifference" murder under § 125.25(2) . [fn1] See Garbutt v. Conway , 668 F.3d 79 (2d Cir.2012); Parker v. Ercole , 666 F.3d 830 (2d Cir.2012); Rivera v. Cuomo , 664 F.3d 20 (2d Cir.2011). In each of these cases, the
petitioner advanced the somewhat perverse argument that he`should be
released from state custody because the evidence suggests he is in fact more culpable than the jury had found him to be. In each case, the New York
courts [*48] rejected that argument, and in each case, we affirmed the dismissal of the
petition for habeas corpus, recognizing that it is not our place to tell New
York courts that they do not understand evolving New York law.
The trend continues here. Appealing from a judgment of the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Raymond J. Dearie, Judge ) denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 , petitioner-appellant Darnell Epps ("petitioner," "Epps,"
or "Darnell") contends that the evidence at his trial was insufficient to
support his conviction for depraved-indifference murder as an accomplice
because his brother Darryl, the principal who in fact shot the victim,
clearly acted with the intent to kill. The Appellate Division of the New
York Supreme Court rejected this argument, holding that, under New York law
at the time Epps's conviction became final, the evidence was sufficient to
support the jury's verdict. See People v. Epps , 38 A.D.3d 916 , 831 N.Y.S.2d 341 (2d Dep't 2007).
Upon review of the record and the arguments of counsel, we conclude that
the Appellate Division's decision was not contrary to, or based on an
unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law as determined
by the Supreme Court. We therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court
dismissing [**2] Epps's petition, substantially for the reasons stated by Judge
Dearie in his thorough and well-reasoned Memorandum and Order of May 14,
2010. See Epps v. Poole , No. 07 cv 3432 , [ 2010 BL 107495 ], 2010 WL 1991517 (E.D.N.Y. May 14,
2010). We write merely to locate this case within the jurisprudence of our
Court and that of the New York Court of Appeals.
Background
In view of Epps's conviction, we recite the pertinent facts in the light
most favorable to the verdict. See, e.g., Garbutt , 668 F.3d at 80 .
In the early morning hours of March 8, 2000, Darnell Epps was sitting in a
van parked outside a convenience store when he was informed by an
acquaintance, Jesus Piazza, that Derek Warren — who was inside the store
with a friend, Randy Jiles — "was calling [Darnell] a pussy." Darnell seemed
unperturbed and drove off in the van. Some time later, however, while Warren
and Jiles were still inside the store, Darnell phoned the store and asked
for Piazza, who was standing outside selling drugs. When Piazza came to the
phone, Darnell told him to leave the store "because something might happen,
it was not safe there." Piazza and some others left the scene, while Warren,
Jiles, another customer named Kenny, and two store employees remained
inside.
At approximately 2:30 a.m., Darnell entered the store, followed by his
brother, Darryl, who "came in fast." Darryl, brandishing a gun, approached
Warren, grabbed him around the neck, and said "I told you to stay out of
this store." Warren then "st[u]ck his arm up on the gun" and "[t]he gun
[went] off." Darnell instinctually drew his own gun, and pointed it at
Jiles. Darryl rapidly fired four more shots into Warren's head and neck. As
Darnell later testified, everything "happened so fast" that he did not know
whether the first shot was intentionally fired by Darryl or whether the gun
had gone off by accident. Although police later confirmed that the only
bullets fired came from Darryl's gun, Darryl himself was somehow shot in the
encounter.
Darnell turned himself in five days later. He gave conflicting accounts in
two written and two videotaped statements, initially telling police that an
"older-looking" Latino man had shot Warren, but later admitting [*49] that his brother was the shooter and had asked that Darnell "back [him] up."
Darnell was charged with one count of second-degree "depraved-indifference"
murder, one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree,
and one count of criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, each
under an "acting in concert" theory.
After Darryl pleaded guilty to second-degree intentional murder, Darnell
was tried before a jury and, on October 11, 2000, found guilty of
second-degree depraved-indifference murder; he was acquitted on the weapons
possession charges. On November 15, 2000, he was sentenced to an
indeterminate term of seventeen and one-half years to life in prison, the
same sentence received by his brother.
On appeal, Darnell argued that, because Darryl's actions were intentional
and not reckless, the evidence was insufficient to convict Darnell as an
accomplice to depraved-indifference murder. The Appellate Division denied
the claim as both un-preserved and without [**3] merit and affirmed his conviction
by order of April 11, 2003. People v. Epps , 305 A.D.2d 697 , 759 N.Y.S.2d 893 (2d Dep't 2003). Leave to appeal was denied on September 15, 2003, and his
conviction became "final" on December 15, 2003. Cf. Clay v. United States , 537 U.S. 522 , 527 , 123 S.Ct. 1072 , 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003) ("[A] judgment of
conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for
certiorari contesting the appellate court's affirmation of the
conviction."); [fn2] S.Ct. R. 13(1) (establishing ninety-day period for
filing petition for writ of certiorari). [fn3]
On June 10, 2003, before Epps's conviction became final, the New York
Court of Appeals decided People v. Hafeez , 100 N.Y.2d 253 , 762 N.Y.S.2d 572 , 792 N.E.2d 1060 (2003), in which it reversed a depraved-indifference murder
conviction based on accomplice liability where the attack on the victim was
"quintessentially intentional." Id. at 258, 762 N.Y.S.2d 572 , 792 N.E.2d 1060 . Thereafter, Epps moved to vacate his conviction under New York Criminal Procedure Law § 440.10 , arguing that Hafeez had changed
New York's depraved-indifference murder law such that his conviction could
no longer be deemed to be supported by the evidence. By decision dated
August 1, 2005, the Supreme Court, King's County, denied the motion,
concluding that, even if Hafeez marked a change in the law, Epps was not
entitled to relief. The Appellate Division affirmed, holding that "[e]ven
under the standard espoused in People v. Hafeez , which was decided after
this court rendered its decision and order on the defendant's direct
appeal[,] but before his conviction became final, the evidence was legally
sufficient to establish the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt." People v. Epps , 38 A.D.3d 916 , 831 N.Y.S.2d 341 , 342 (2d Dep't 2007)
(internal citations omitted).
On August 1, 2007, Epps filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254 . He argued that, under New York law at the time his
conviction [*50] became final, the evidence produced at trial was consistent only with an
intentional murder and, consequently, insufficient to support his conviction
for depraved-indifference murder as an accomplice. He also raised a claim of
ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court denied the petition on
both grounds. See Epps v. Poole , No. 07-cv-3432 , [ 2010 BL 107495 ], 2010 WL 1991517 (E.D.N.Y.
May 14, 2010). We granted a certificate of appealability on the sufficiency
claim and now affirm the judgment of the District Court.
Discussion
We review de novo a district court's denial of a petition for a writ of
habeas corpus. See Henry v. Ricks , 578 F.3d 134 , 137 (2d Cir.2009). The writ
may not issue for any claim adjudicated on the merits by a state court
unless the state court's decision was "contrary to, or involved an
unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law as determined
by the Supreme Court of the United States," or was "based on an unreasonable
determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State
Court proceeding." 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (d)(1)- (2). The state court's findings of
fact are presumed to be correct unless the petitioner can rebut this
presumption by clear and convincing evidence. Id . § 2254(e)(1) . The
petitioner bears the ultimate burden of proving by a preponderance of the
evidence that his constitutional rights have been violated. Jones v. Vacco , 126 F.3d 408 , 415 (2d Cir.1997).
In cases challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a
state-court criminal conviction, [**4] our concern is not with the state courts'
application of the state law defining the offense, but rather with the state
courts' application of federal law, and, in particular, the sufficiency
standard set forth by the Supreme Court in Jackson v. Virginia , 443 U.S. 307 , 99 S.Ct. 2781 , 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Under this standard,
"the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light
most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have
found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt." Id. at
319, 99 S.Ct. 2781 .
We therefore review sufficiency challenges to state-court convictions
under a "doubly deferential standard of review." Garbutt , 668 F.3d at 81 . We
defer first to the jury's verdict, drawing all inferences in its favor. See, e.g., United States v. Archer , 671 F.3d 149 , 160 (2d Cir.2011). Second, we
defer to the state courts' rejection of the defendant's constitutional
arguments, at least insofar as it did not result from an unreasonable
determination of the facts or an unreasonable application of clearly
established federal law. See Garbutt , 668 F.3d at 81 . A third layer of
deference applies in cases like this one, where "the state appellate court's
assessment of the evidence is intertwined with its interpretation of a
complex and evolving body of state law, with which the state courts have far
more familiarity than we have." Id. at 82 .
I.
Under New York law, a person is guilty of depraved-indifference murder
when, "[u]nder circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life,
he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to
another person and thereby causes the death of another person." N.Y. Penal Law § 125.25 (2). In contrast, a person is guilty of intentional
murder when "[w]ith intent to cause the death of another person, he causes
the death of such person or of a third person." Id . § 125.25(1) . Both
depraved-indifference murder and intentional murder under section 125.25 qualify as "murder in the [*51] second degree" and are class A-I felonies under New York law. Id . § 125.25 .
At the time of Darnell's trial and conviction, the controlling decision on
the elements of depraved-indifference murder was People v. Register , 60 N.Y.2d 270 , 469 N.Y.S.2d 599 , 457 N.E.2d 704 (1983). Under the so-called
" Register regime," in order to convict a defendant on a charge of
depraved-indifference murder, a jury was required to find, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that the defendant "(1) recklessly engaged in conduct (2)
which created a grave risk of death to another person (3) thereby causing
the death of another person (4) under circumstances evincing a depraved
indifference to human life." Policano v. Herbert , 7 N.Y.3d 588 , 602 , 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 (2006) (summarizing the law as of June 28,
2001). The mens rea for depraved-indifference murder was recklessness, and
the statutory phrase "`under circumstance evincing a depraved indifference
to human life' defined the factual setting, viewed objectively, in which the
risk-creating conduct occurred." Id.
In Policano v. Herbert , the Court of Appeals described the hallmarks of
the Register regime as twofold:
First, even though . . . an attack by its very nature presents
    compelling circumstantial evidence of intent to cause death, we
    considered the question of the defendant's state of mind to be a
    classic matter for the jury. . . .
Second, the factual [**5] setting in which the risk-creating conduct
    must occur, viewed objectively — Register's standard for determining
    whether there are circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to
    human life — was fulfilled if a defendant's actions created an
    almost certain risk of death by, for example, shooting the victim in
    the head multiple times at close range.
Id. at 599-600, 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 (2006). Notably, the fact
"[t]hat a defendant's acts virtually guaranteed the victim's death did not,
in and of itself, preclude a guilty verdict on a theory of depraved
indifference." Id. at 601 , 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 . There can be
little doubt, therefore, that, under the law as it stood at the time of
Darnell's conviction on October 11, 2000, the evidence justified the jury's
verdict.
Darnell argues, however, that, by the time his conviction became final , in
December 2003, New York law on depraved-indifference murder had changed such
that his conviction was no longer supported by the evidence. It is true
that, between the years 2003 and 2006, the Court of Appeals issued a
remarkable series of decisions — People v. Hafeez , 100 N.Y.2d 253 , 762 N.Y.S.2d 572 , 792 N.E.2d 1060 (2003); People v. Gonzalez , 1 N.Y.3d 464 , 775 N.Y.S.2d 224 , 807 N.E.2d 273 (2004); People v. Payne , 3 N.Y.3d 266 , 786 N.Y.S.2d 116 , 819 N.E.2d 634 (2004); People v. Suarez , 6 N.Y.3d 202 , 811 N.Y.S.2d 267 , 844 N.E.2d 721 (2005); and People v. Feingold , 7 N.Y.3d 288 , 819 N.Y.S.2d 691 , 852 N.E.2d 1163 (2006) — that "incrementally
pointed the law in a different direction." Policano , 7 N.Y.3d at 595 , 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 (internal quotation marks omitted). As the
Court of Appeals later explained, during this time "one of [the] elements
[of depraved-indifference murder] —`under circumstances evincing a depraved
indifference to human life' — gradually and perceptibly changed from an
objectively determined degree-of-risk standard (the Register formulation) to
a mens rea." Id. at 602-03, 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 . Ultimately, in Feingold , decided in July 2006, the Court of Appeals reversed Register and
held that "`depraved indifference to human life' is a culpable mental
state." 7 N.Y.3d at 296 , 819 N.Y.S.2d 691 , 852 N.E.2d 1163 . Inasmuch [*52] as a finding of indifference to human life (depraved or otherwise) is
incompatible with a finding of a specific intent to cause death, Darnell
argues that the jury's verdict of October 11, 2000 (which became final on
December 15, 2003) cannot be reconciled with the evidence at trial tending
to show that his brother, the principal, acted with the specific intent to
kill.
However, the New York Court of Appeals has made it abundantly clear that
the current understanding of the elements of depraved-indifference murder —
under which the mens rea is no longer recklessness, but depraved
indifference to human life — does not apply retroactively to persons whose
convictions became final before the offense was redefined. Policano , 7 N.Y.3d at 603-04 , 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 . [fn4] Accordingly, the
success of Darnell's argument depends upon a determination that the offense
was redefined in July 2003 with the Court of Appeals's decision in People v. Hafeez , the only one of the cases mentioned above to have been decided
before his conviction became final. In Policano , the Court of Appeals
declined to identify "where along this trajectory a majority of the Court
may have effectively passed the point of no return — the limit beyond which,
hard as [it] may have tried, it was simply not possible to reconcile [its]
developing case law with Register and Sanchez. " 7 N.Y.3d at 604 , 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 . As we discuss momentarily, [**6] deferring to a
more recent decision of the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme
Court, we do not believe that Hafeez marked the "point of no return." We
therefore address Darnell's sufficiency claim under the law of New York as
stated in Register in 1983 and reaffirmed in Sanchez in 2002.
First, however, we briefly address an issue that has led to some confusion
in this matter: Why should the principal's intent dictate the outcome of a
case concerning the accomplice's mental state?
II.
Under section 20.00 of the New York Penal Law, "[w]hen one person engages
in conduct which constitutes an offense, another person is criminally liable
for such conduct when, acting with the mental culpability required for the
commission thereof, he solicits, requests, commands, importunes, or
intentionally aids such person to engage in such conduct." Based on the
plain meaning of the statute, it would seem that accomplice liability does
not depend on the mental state of the principal, but rather, on the mental
state of the accomplice combined with the "conduct" of the principal. [fn5] As the Court of Appeals held in People v. Flayhart :
Penal Law § 20.00 imposes accessorial liability on an accomplice
    not for aiding or encouraging another to reach a particular mental
    state, but rather for intentionally [*53] aiding another to engage in conduct which constitutes the charged
    offense while himself "acting with the mental culpability required
    for the commission" of that offense.
72 N.Y.2d 737 , 741 , 536 N.Y.S.2d 727 , 533 N.E.2d 657 (1988) (second emphasis
added). [fn6]
However, in People v. Hafeez , the New York Court of Appeals stated that a
defendant can be convicted for depraved-indifference murder under a theory
of accomplice liability "only if he intentionally aided [the] codefendant in
commission of the crime and shared the codefendant's culpable mental state." 100 N.Y.2d at 258 , 762 N.Y.S.2d 572 , 792 N.E.2d 1060 . (emphasis added).
Similarly, when this issue was raised at oral argument in the case at bar,
both parties agreed that New York law requires proof of a "shared intent" or
"community of purpose" between the accomplice and principal, in order to
impose accessorial liability on the accomplice.
This language of "shared intent" and "community of purpose" appears to be
a relic of case-law construing section 2 of the former Penal Law, which did
not contain a mens rea requirement. As the New York Court of Appeals
explained in 1990, "in order to prevent the imposition of criminal liability
for the principal's crime on someone who may have been merely present
[without intending to aid in the offense], the courts [construing section 2
of the former Penal Law] required proof that the aider or abettor`share[d]
the intent or purpose of the principal actor.'" People v. Kaplan , 76 N.Y.2d 140 , 144 , 556 N.Y.S.2d 976 , 556 N.E.2d 415 (1990) (quoting, inter alia, People v. La Belle , 18 N.Y.2d 405 , 412 , 276 N.Y.S.2d 105 , 222 N.E.2d 727 (1966) (final alteration in Kaplan )). As the Court of Appeals
recognized in Kaplan , the need for this judge-made requirement was
eliminated with the adoption of section 20.00 in the revised Penal Law, but
"the`shared intent or purpose' language from . . . earlier cases [still]
appears occasionally even in cases arising under the modern statute." Id. at
144-45 , 556 N.Y.S.2d 976 , 556 N.E.2d 415 .
If New York law does not, in fact, require that an accomplice and
principal share the same [**7] mental state, then the evidence of Darnell's
conduct in this case would support his conviction of depraved-indifference
murder irrespective of the evidence tending to show that Darryl, the
principal, acted with the intent to kill. Nevertheless, given the confusion
surrounding this issue and the agreement of the parties that a "shared
intent" or "community of purpose" is required, we are hesitant to rest our
decision in this case on a contrary understanding of accomplice liability
under New York law. Moreover, we conclude that we would reach the same
result whether or not New York law requires that the principal and
accomplice share the same mental state.
We therefore proceed to address whether, in light of his brother's mental
state, the evidence adduced at Darnell's trial was sufficient to convict him
of depraved-indifference murder under New York law as it [*54] stood at the time his conviction became final.
III.
In its decision affirming the denial of Darnell's motion under New York Criminal Procedure Law § 440.10 , the Appellate Division held that,
"[e]ven under the standard espoused in People v. Hafeez , which was decided
after this court rendered its decision and order on the defendant's direct
appeal but before his conviction became final, the evidence was legally
sufficient to establish the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt." People v. Epps , 38 A.D.3d 916 , 831 N.Y.S.2d 341 , 342 (2d Dep't 2007)
(internal citations omitted). The question for us is not whether, in
arriving at that determination, the Appellate Division correctly applied New
York law on depraved-indifference murder (including Hafeez ), but only
whether it correctly applied federal law requiring sufficient evidence to
support a jury verdict on each element of the charged offense. The federal
standard, as set forth by the Supreme Court in Jackson v. Virginia , is
whether, "after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the
prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential
elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt." 443 U.S. at 319 , 99 S.Ct. 2781 .
As stated above, at the time of Darnell's conviction, in order to convict
a defendant of depraved indifference murder, a jury had to find that the
defendant: "(1) recklessly engaged in conduct (2) that created a grave risk
of death to another person (3) thereby causing the death of another person
(4) under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life." Policano v. Herbert , 7 N.Y.3d 588 , 602 , 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 (2006). Darnell argues, however, that the Hafeez decision — which was filed
in June 2003, approximately six months before his conviction became "final," see note 2, ante — signaled a fundamental change in the law of depraved
indifference murder. We disagree.
In Hafeez , the defendant and a co-defendant targeted the victim in
retaliation for an injury the codefendant had sustained in a confrontation
with the victim months earlier. On the night of the murder, the defendant
and co-defendant lured the victim out of the bar, the defendant pushed him
up against a wall, and the co-defendant stabbed him once in the heart. The
defendant was convicted as an accomplice of depraved-indifference murder,
but the Court of Appeals, [**8] affirming the Appellate Division, reversed the
conviction, noting that the murder had been plotted for months and that the
stabbing was "a quintessentially intentional attack directed solely at the
victim." Hafeez , 100 N.Y.2d at 258 , 762 N.Y.S.2d 572 , 792 N.E.2d 1060 .
We have previously observed in a nonprecedential order, and now expressly
decide, that "[t]he Hafeez court did no more than find, under the particular
facts of that case, that there was no evidence that the defendant acted with
anything other than intent to kill." Grant v. Woods , 313 Fed. Appx. 376 , 377 (2d Cir.2009) (summary order). More importantly (because this is a question
of state law), the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court has
squarely held that neither Hafeez , nor the Court of Appeals's subsequent
decision in Gonzalez , marked the "point of no return" abrogating the prior
law of the " Register regime." People v. Baptiste , 51 A.D.3d 184 , 853 N.Y.S.2d 719 , 721-25 (3d Dep't 2008). Rather, the Appellate Division has
held that "the law changed on October 19, 2004, when the Court [of Appeals]
decided People v. Payne." Id. at 720 .
The question of when New York law changed is, of course, a question for
the New York courts. We are "bound to apply the law as interpreted by [the]
state's intermediate appellate courts unless there is persuasive evidence
that the state's highest court would reach a different conclusion." V.S. v. Muhammad , 595 F.3d 426 , 432 (2d Cir".2010). See generally Comm'r Int. Rev. v. Estate of Bosch , 387 U.S. 456 , 465 , 87 S.Ct. 1776 , 18 L.Ed.2d 886 (1967).
We see no such evidence here. On the contrary, we note that the Appellate
Division's decision in Baptiste was thorough and well-reasoned and answered
a question that had been expressly left open by the Court of Appeals. [fn7] It appears, moreover, that the Baptiste decision did not meet with the
disapproval of the Court of Appeals, which denied Baptiste's application for
leave to appeal. See People v. Baptiste , 10 N.Y.3d 932 , 862 N.Y.S.2d 338 , 892 N.E.2d 404 (June 13, 2008) (Table). Because we do not believe that the
Court of Appeals would reach a different conclusion than that reached in Baptiste , we defer to the determination of the Appellate Division that Hafeez was not an abrogation of the Register/Sanchez standard, but rather,
merely an application of that standard to the facts of the particular
case. [fn8]
Accordingly, at the time Darnell's conviction became final (on December
15, 2003, see note 2, ante ), the mens rea element of depraved-indifference
murder was still "recklessness" and the phrase "under circumstances evincing
a depraved indifference to human life" merely defined the factual setting in
which the risk-creating conduct occurred. See Policano , 7 N.Y.3d at 602 , 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 ; see also People v. Sanchez , 98 N.Y.2d 373 , 380 , 748 N.Y.S.2d 312 , 777 N.E.2d 204 (2002) ("[T]he crux of murder under
Penal Law § 125.25(2) is recklessness exaggerated by indifference to the
circumstances objectively demonstrating the enormity of the risk of death
from the defendant's conduct."). On the record before us, we cannot conclude
that no rational trier of fact could have found that Darnell' Epps — or his
brother — acted recklessly, under factual circumstances evincing a depraved
indifference to human life, and not with the intent to kill.
As the District Court observed, a rational juror hearing the evidence in
this case could have found that Darryl did not go into the store intending [**9] to kill Warren, but instead recklessly brandished his gun to threaten
Warren. See Epps , [ 2010 BL 107495 ], 2010 WL 1991517, at *6. As Darnell Epps himself testified
at his trial, the victim (Warren) "st[u]ck his arm up on the gun," and there
followed a "quick hand action and a shot went off." Darnell testified that
everything "happened so fast," and indeed, it appears that the encounter was
so frenetic [*56] that Darryl somehow shot himself. In contrast to Hafeez , the evidence in
this case did not compel the conclusion that the victim was specifically
targeted and his death plotted in advance.
Although the fact that Darryl shot Warren several times in the head and
neck was certainly "compelling circumstantial evidence of an intent to cause
death," Policano , 7 N.Y.3d at 599 , 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 , it is
not dispositive. Under the law of Register and Sanchez (which was not
abrogated by Hafeez ) "the question of the defendant's state of mind [was
considered] to be a classic matter for the jury," and a conviction for
depraved-indifference murder could be sustained even "if a defendant's
actions created an almost certain risk of death by, for example, shooting
the victim in the head multiple times at close range." Policano , 7 N.Y.3d at 600 , 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 . As the District Court
held, "petitioner's case is`squarely within the then-established rule that a
. . . depraved indifference murder count [] could be submitted to the jury
unless there was`absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the defendant might
have acted unintentionally." Epps , 2010 WL 1991517, at *6 (quoting Grant , 313 Fed.Appx. at 377 and Policano , 7 N.Y.3d at 601 , 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 ).
The Appellate Division's holding that the evidence in the trial of Darnell
Epps supported his conviction of depraved-indifference murder was thus not
contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal
law as expounded by the Supreme Court. Viewing the evidence in the light
most favorable to the verdict, and deferring to the New York courts on the
question of what elements need to be proved to support a conviction for
depraved-indifference murder, we cannot conclude that no rational trier of
fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a
reasonable doubt. See Jackson , 443 U.S. at 319 , 99 S.Ct. 2781 ; cf. Rivera v. Cuomo , 664 F.3d 20 , 21-22 (2d Cir.2011) ("[A]lthough evidence
of`significantly heightened recklessness' was slim, at best, giving the
state courts and the jury the utmost deference, we cannot find that the
evidence was so completely lacking that no rational jury could have found
Rivera guilty of depraved indifference murder." (internal citation
omitted)).
CONCLUSION
We hold that, in concluding that the evidence at trial supported the
conviction of Darnell Epps for depraved-indifference murder as a matter of state law as understood at the time the conviction became final (December
15, 2003), the Appellate Division, Second Department, did not unreasonably
apply federal law. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court
denying Darnell Epps's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.
[fn1] New York Penal Law § 125.25 (1) provides that "[a] person is guilty of
murder in the second degree when: (1) With intent to cause the death of
another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person."
Section 125.25(2) provides that "[a] person is guilty of murder in the
second degree when: (2) Under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference
to human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk
of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another
person."
[fn2] Because the ninetieth day of this period fell on a Sunday, Darnell's
conviction in fact became final the next day, December 15, 2003. See S.Ct.
R. 30.1 .
[fn3] Although the Supreme Court's decision in Clay applies specifically to
finality for purposes of filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255 , it appears the New York Courts apply the same principle
for determining the finality of a conviction for purposes of the retroactive
application of state law. See Policano v. Herbert , 7 N.Y.3d 588 , 593 , 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 682 , 859 N.E.2d 484 (2006) ("Defendant's conviction became
final 90 days later . . . when his time for filing a petition for writ of
certiorari in the United States Supreme Court expired.").
[fn4] We have similarly held, with reference to New York's evolving
jurisprudence on depraved-indifference murder, that "the Due Process Clause
does not require the retroactive application of a new interpretation of a
criminal statute by the New York Court of Appeals in our collateral review
of a conviction." Henry v. Ricks , 578 F.3d 134 , 141 (2d Cir.2009).
[fn5] In most cases, of course, the "mental culpability required for the
commission" of an offense will be consistent with the mental culpability
possessed by the principal. That is not necessarily the case with respect to
second-degree murder, however, because that offense contains several
alternative kinds of "mental culpability," each of which will support a
conviction when combined with the defendant's act of "caus[ing] the death"
of another under the circumstances specified in the particular subsection
charged. See New York Penal Law § 125.25 (1)-( 5 ).
[fn6] Indeed, Penal Law § 20.05 states that it is not a defense to
accessorial liability that the principal is "not guilty of the offense in
question owing to . . . other factors precluding the mental state required
for the commission of the offense in question." Furthermore, § 20.15
provides that "when, pursuant to section 20.00, two or more persons are
criminally liable for an offense which is divided into degrees, each person
is guilty of such degree as is compatible with his own culpable mental
state" (emphasis added). These provisions support the view that, under New
York law, a defendant is responsible only for his own mental state.
[fn7] We find it important that the Court of Appeals in Policano merely
declined to identify "the point of no return," 7 N.Y.3d at 603 , 825 N.Y.S.2d 678 , 859 N.E.2d 484 ; it did not hold that there was no such
identifiable point.
[fn8] Our decision in Henry v. Ricks , 578 F.3d 134 (2d Cir.2009), is not to
the contrary. In Henry , the petitioner urged us to conclude that the line of
New York Court of Appeals cases from 2003 to 2006 did not mark a change in
the law, but, rather, clarified the law as it existed at the time his
conviction became final, in 2000. See id. at 136. We rejected that argument,
noting that the Court of Appeals in Policano "explained that the recent
decisions marked a change in the law that did not apply retroactively."- Id. at 138. This observation does not constitute a holding that the change in
the law occurred with Hafeez , the first case in the line, as would be
necessary to support Eppis's claim here. On the contrary, the Court of
Appeals made clear in Policano that it was not deciding when, precisely, the
"point of no return" was reached. 7 N.Y.3d at 604 .
