United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit.
UNITED STATES of America, Plaintiff-Appellee, v. Bobby C. ODOM,
Defendant-Appellant.
No. 11-31136.
September 6, 2012. [*545]
Cristina Walker, Asst. U.S. Atty., Earl M. Campbell, Shreveport, LA, for
Plaintiff-Appellee.
Elton Boyce Richey, Jr., Law Office of Elton B. Richey, Jr., Shreveport, LA,
for Defendant-Appellant.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of
Louisiana.
Before KING, SMITH and HIGGINSON, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM:
Bobby C. Odom appeals his 264-month sentence following his guilty plea to
sexual exploitation of children, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2251 (a), (e) and § 2 . Odom's sole contention on appeal is that the district [*546] court erred in applying a two-level enhancement for distribution of explicit
materials minor under § 2G2.1 (b)(3) of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines
Manual. For the reasons stated below, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district
court.
I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Defendant-Appellant Bobby C. Odom pleaded guilty to Count One of an
indictment charging him and Richard A. Franklin with the sexual exploitation
of children, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2251 (a), (e) and § 2 . The district
court imposed a Guidelines sentence, beginning with a base offense level of
32 under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2G2.1 (a). The district court
increased the offense level by two levels under § 2G2.1 (b)(1)(B) based on
its conclusion that Odom's offense involved a minor who had attained the age
of 12 years but not attained the age of 16 years, and the court imposed
another two-level increase under § 2G2.1 (b)(2)(A) because the offense
involved the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact. The district
court then imposed an additional two-level increase under § 2G2.1 (b)(3)
based on its finding that Odom's "offense involved distribution." Because
Odom's offense involved two minor victims, the district court then
calculated a combined offense level of 40 under § 3D1.4 . Finally, the
district court applied a three-level reduction based on Odom's acceptance of
responsibility under § 3E1.1 (b), resulting in a total offense level of 37.
Based on the total offense level of 37 and Odom's criminal history category
of III, the Guidelines imprisonment range was 262 to 327 months. The
district court imposed a sentence of 264 months' imprisonment, followed by a
supervised release term of 10 years.
At sentencing, Odom objected to the imposition of the enhancement for
distribution under § 2G2.1 (b)(3). The Guidelines define "distribution" as
"any act, including possession with intent to distribute, production,
transmission, advertisement, and transportation, related to the transfer of
material involving the sexual exploitation of a minor." U.S. SENTENCING
GUIDELINES MANUAL § 2G2.1 cmt. n.1. Odom contended that there was no
evidence that any explicit materials had been distributed, and that his
assistance in producing the images did not make out "distribution" under the
Guidelines. However, the district court adopted the finding in Odom's
Presentence Investigation Report ("PSR") that Franklin, Odom's co-defendant,
had "advised [law enforcement] that several adults had seen the [explicit]
pictures [at issue]." The district court did not expressly rule on Odom's
"production" argument, stating only that "the two-point enhancement is not [**2] improperly applied in this particular case under those factual circumstances
set forth in the presentence report." Odom timely appealed, reiterating his
contention that the district court improperly applied the enhancement for
involving a distribution under § 2G2.1 (b)(3).
II. DISCUSSION
A. Standard of Review
Odom properly preserved his challenge to the district court's imposition
of an enhancement under § 2G2.1 (b)(3), and thus the district court's
adjustment is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Gutierrez , 635 F.3d 148 , 154 (5th Cir.2011). This court reviews the district
court's interpretation and application of the Guidelines de novo, and the
district court's factual findings are reviewed for clear error. United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez [*547] , 517 F.3d 751 , 764 (5th Cir.2008). "There is no clear
error if the district court's finding is plausible in light of the record as
a whole." Id. (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A factual
"finding will be deemed clearly erroneous if, based on the record as a
whole, [this court is] left with the definite and firm conviction that a
mistake has been committed." United States v. Ekanem , 555 F.3d 172 , 175 (5th
Cir.2009) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
Pursuant to Gall v. United States , 552 U.S. 38 , 49-51 , 128 S.Ct. 586 , 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), this court engages in a bifurcated review process of
the sentence imposed by the district court. United States v. Delgado-Martinez , 564 F.3d 750 , 752 (5th Cir.2009). First, this court
considers whether the district court committed a "significant procedural
error," such as miscalculating the advisory Guidelines range. Id. If there
is no error or the error is harmless, this court may proceed to the second
step and review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed for
an abuse of discretion. Id. at 753. Odom, however, does not challenge the
substantive reasonableness of his sentence on appeal.
B. Enhancement under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2G2.1 (b)(3)
Odom contends that, in calculating his sentence, the district court erred
by imposing a two-level enhancement under § 2G2.1 (b)(3). Odom challenges the
district court's finding that Franklin distributed the explicit images Odom
helped to produce. The district court based its finding on the statement in
Odom's PSR that Franklin admitted that he allowed several adults to view the
images at issue. According to Odom, however, there is no evidence that
Franklin showed the images to anyone other than Odom.
We conclude that the district court did not commit clear error in
concluding that, as set out in the PSR, Franklin had shown the images at
issue to several adults. As this court has stated,
[g]enerally, a PSR bears sufficient indicia of reliability to
    permit the sentencing court to rely on it at sentencing. The
    defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that the PSR is
    inaccurate; in the absence of rebuttal evidence, the sentencing
    court may properly rely on the PSR and adopt it.
United States v. Ollison , 555 F.3d 152 , 164 (5th Cir.2009) (citation and
internal quotation marks omitted). At the sentencing hearing, counsel for
Odom objected to the enhancement under § 2G2.1 (b)(3), and indicated that he
had not seen evidence that Franklin had shown the images [**3] at issue to anyone
other than Odom. However, "rebuttal evidence must demonstrate that the PSR
information is materially untrue, inaccurate or unreliable." United States v. Parker , 133 F.3d 322 , 329 (5th Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks
omitted). In addition, "[m]ere objections do not suffice as competent
rebuttal evidence." Id. Thus, Odom failed to demonstrate that the PSR was
inaccurate, and the district court did not clearly err in finding that
Franklin had shown the explicit images to several adults.
Odom further argues that the § 2G2.1 (b)(3) enhancement does not apply
because he did not distribute the images in question, and his help in
producing the images does not make out "distribution" as defined in the
Guidelines. See § 2G2.1 cmt. n.1. Whether Odom personally "distributed" the
images is inapposite, however, because the district court implicitly
determined that Franklin's act of distribution was fairly attributable to
Odom as "relevant conduct." Under the Guidelines, the [*548] relevant conduct used to determine a defendant's advisory sentencing range
includes "all harm that resulted from" "all acts and omissions committed . .
. by the defendant." § 1B1.3 (a)(1), (a)(3). The record shows that Franklin's
distribution of the images — the contemplated "harm" to the minor victims —
resulted from Odom's help in producing them. United States v. Valenzuela-Contreras , 340 Fed. Appx. 230 , 236 (5th Cir.2009) (applying
Guidelines enhancement where harm indirectly resulted from the defendant's
acts).
On appeal, Odom does not dispute that Franklin's distribution of the
explicit images constituted harm to the victims, or that Odom's assistance
in producing the images ultimately resulted in their distribution. Odom
contends only that there was no evidence of distribution. However, as
discussed above, the district court's factual finding that Franklin
distributed the images was not clearly erroneous. Consequently, we conclude
that the district court properly determined that Franklin's distribution of
the images that Odom helped to create was relevant conduct attributable to
Odom.
III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district
court.
