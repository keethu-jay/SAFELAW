Judges.
OPINION
FISHER, Circuit Judge:
We consider whether the district court erred by sentencing Jason Lee as a
career [*788] offender under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 4B1.1 based on his two
prior convictions under California Health and Safety Code § 11352 (a). We
hold that the government has not satisfied its burden of showing that one of
these two convictions qualifies as a predicate offense and remand for the
district court to reconsider Lee's career offender status.
I.
Jason Lee was convicted of distributing crack cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841 . The district court sentenced Lee as a career offender under
U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 4B1.1 after concluding [**2] that his two
prior convictions under California Health & Safety Code § 11352 (a) qualified
as controlled substance offenses. The guidelines recommended 262 to 327
months' imprisonment. After considering the 18 U.S.C. § 3553 (a) factors, the
court sentenced Lee to 180 months.
Lee timely appeals, arguing that the district court erred when it
classified him as a career offender.
II.
We review de novo a district court's interpretation of the guidelines and
its determination that a defendant qualifies as a career offender under § 4B1.1 . See United States v. Mitchell , 624 F.3d 1023 , 1026 (9th Cir.2010).
III.
A defendant is a career offender if:
(1) the defendant was at least 18 years old at the time he
    committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense
    of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a
    controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two
    prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a
    controlled substance offense.
U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 4B1.1 (a). Lee contests only the third
requirement.
To determine whether a defendant's prior conviction qualifies as a
predicate offense, we apply the "categorical approach" and "modified
categorical approach" set forth in Taylor v. United States , 495 U.S. 575 , 110 S.Ct. 2143 , 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). Under the categorical approach, we
"look only to the statute of conviction." United States v. Crawford , 520 F.3d 1072 , 1078 (9th Cir.2008) (citation omitted). We "compare the
elements of the statutory definition of the crime of conviction with a
federal definition of the crime to determine whether conduct proscribed by
the statute is broader than the generic federal definition." United States v. Gonzalez-Aparicio , 663 F.3d 419 , 425 (9th Cir.2011) (citation and
internal quotation marks omitted). "[E]ven the least egregious conduct the
statute [of conviction] covers must qualify." Id . (alterations in original)
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
If the statute is facially over-inclusive, we employ the modified
categorical approach. See Crawford , 520 F.3d at 1078 . Under this approach,
the prior conviction qualifies as a career offender predicate offense only
"if`documentation or judicially noticeable facts . . . clearly establish
that the conviction is a predicate conviction for enhancement purposes.'" Id . (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. Corona-Sanchez , 291 F.3d 1201 , 1211 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc)). When, as here, the prior
conviction was based on a guilty plea, our review is limited to the charging
document, plea agreement, transcript of the plea colloquy and comparable [*789] judicial records. See id . "The government has the burden to establish
clearly and unequivocally that the conviction was based on all of the
elements of a qualifying predicate offense." Id . (quoting United States v. Kovac , 367 F.3d 1116 , 1119 (9th Cir.2004)) (internal quotation marks
omitted).
We apply the categorical and modified categorical approaches to Lee's §
11352(a) convictions in turn.
A. Categorical Approach
In 1998, Lee twice pled guilty to violating California Health & Safety
Code § 11352 (a) — one violation occurred in San Francisco, and the other in
Alameda County. At the time of his convictions, § 11352(a) provided that
"every person who transports, imports into [**3] this state, sells, furnishes,
administers, or gives away, or offers to transport, import into this state,
sell, furnish, administer, or give away, or attempts to import into this
state or transport [certain substances specified in the California Uniform
Controlled Substances Act] shall be punished by imprisonment in the state
prison for three, four, or five years." Cal. Health & Safety Code § 11352 (a)
(1998).
The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines define "controlled substance offense" as an
offense "punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that
prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a
controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a
controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to
manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense." U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 .
The government concedes that § 11352(a) encompasses a broader range of
conduct than the guidelines definition because § 11352(a) , for instance,
criminalizes the transportation of a controlled substance, which would not
be a controlled substance offense. The government thus agrees that Lee's
convictions under § 11352(a) are not categorically controlled substance
offenses. See Crawford 520 F.3d at 1078 (also noting the government's
concession that § 11352(a) "is too broad to qualify under the categorical
approach because [it] covers such a wide range of possible behavior").
B. Modified Categorical Approach
The government argues that Lee's two § 11352(a) convictions nonetheless
qualify as controlled substance offenses under the modified categorical
approach.
i. San Francisco Conviction
The government has proffered the following records to establish that Lee's
San Francisco conviction was a controlled substance offense:
• An information, count one of which charges that Lee "did
    wilfully and unlawfully transport, import into the State of
    California, sell, furnish, administer, and give away, and offer to
    transport, import into the State of California, sell, furnish,
    administer, and give away, and attempt to import into the State of
    California and transport a controlled substance, to wit, COCAINE
    Schedule I."
• Minute orders from Lee's change of plea and sentencing hearings
    that indicate Lee pled guilty to count one.
The government's sole argument is that Lee's plea to the conjunctively
phrased charging document establishes that he pled guilty to all of the
conduct charged. Thus, Lee pled guilty to selling a controlled substance,
which would qualify as a controlled substance offense. We recently rejected
this argument in Young v. Holder , 697 F.3d 976 (9th Cir.2012) (en banc). [*790] Considering a defendant's plea to a count that also recited § 11352(a) in
the conjunctive, we held: "when either`A' or`B' could support a conviction,
a defendant who pleads guilty to a charging document alleging`A and B'
admits only`A' or`B.' Thus, when the record of conviction consists only of a
charging document that includes several theories of the crime, at least one
of which would not qualify as a predicate conviction, then the record is
inconclusive under the modified categorical approach." Id. at 988 . [**4] Here, as
in Young , at least one of the theories charged — for instance, that Lee
transported cocaine — would not qualify as a predicate offense. The record
is thus inconclusive as to whether Lee's San Francisco § 11352(a) conviction
was a controlled substance offense, falling short of the government's burden
to establish the predicate offense clearly and unequivocally. [fn1]
ii. Alameda County Conviction
The government relies on the following documents to show that Lee's
Alameda County conviction under § 11352(a) was a controlled substance
offense:
• An indictment charging that Lee "did then and there sell and
    offer to sell a controlled substance, to wit: cocaine base."
• A court document, which appears to have followed Lee's change of
    plea hearing, stating that Lee pled guilty to violating § 11352(a) "as charged in the Indictment."
• A minute order, also stating that Lee pled guilty to violating §
    11352(a) "as charged in the Indictment" and imposing a sentence that
    was suspended for a three-year probationary period.
These documents on their face establish that Lee pled guilty to selling or
offering to sell cocaine base — conduct that falls squarely within the
definition of controlled substance offense. [fn2] Lee acknowledges that this
evidence would ordinarily be sufficient to establish that a defendant pled
guilty to selling or offering to sell cocaine base. See United States v. Snellenberger , 548 F.3d 699 , 702 (9th Cir.2008) (en banc) (per curiam)
(holding that a minute order can be relied upon to prove that the defendant
pled guilty to a particular count in a charging document), overruled on other grounds by Young , 697 F.3d at 979 , 986-88 . He argues, however, that
the court records here are internally inconsistent as to whether he pled to
a sales offense or a transportation offense, and thus do not prove with
sufficient certainty that he was convicted of a qualifying offense. [*791]
In particular, Lee focuses on the minute order that shows he received only
three years' probation for his conviction. California law provides that
"probation shall not be granted to, nor shall the execution or imposition of
sentence be suspended for, . . . [a]ny person who is convicted of violating Section 11352 of the Health and Safety Code by selling or offering to sell
cocaine base." Cal.Penal Code § 1203.073 (b)(7). A person convicted of
selling or offering to sell cocaine base
may be granted probation only in an unusual case where the
    interests of justice would best be served. When probation is granted in such a case, the court shall specify on the record and shall enter in the minutes the circumstances indicating that the interests of justice would best be served by such a disposition.
Id. § 1203.073(a) (emphasis added). [fn3] Under this statute, if Lee had been
convicted of selling or offering to sell cocaine base, he would have been
ineligible for probation unless the sentencing court made the requisite
specific findings on the record and entered them in the minutes. Although
the records make clear that Lee received probation, none of them indicates
that the sentencing court made any such specific findings.
Lee argues that the absence of special [**5] findings creates an ambiguity
regarding the crime to which he pled. According to Lee, there are two
possibilities: he might have pled to a sales offense, in which case the
sentencing court committed procedural error by sentencing him to probation
without making the necessary findings on the record; or he might have actually pled to something else, such as a transportation offense, for which
he would have been eligible for probation without special findings. See People v. Bartlett , 226 Cal. App.3d 244 , 276 Cal.Rptr. 460 , 465 (1990)
(holding that § 1203.073(b)(1) 's restriction on probation for selling
cocaine does not apply to transportation offenses).
Lee's attempt to manufacture an ambiguity is not convincing. The
indictment explicitly charged Lee with "sell[ing] or offer[ing] to sell"
cocaine base, not transporting cocaine. The minute order from Lee's change
of plea hearing states that Lee pled guilty to the violation of § 11352(a) "as charged in the indictment." The phrase "as charged" is "critical," United States v. Vidal , 504 F.3d 1072 , 1087 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc),
because it means that the factual allegations stated in the indictment are
incorporated into Lee's guilty plea. Although the sentencing court granted
Lee probation without making special findings on the record, it was more
likely a procedural oversight during sentencing rather than the result of
Lee having pled to something different from what was "charged in the
indictment."
Lee also cites to an abstract of judgment as creating doubt about the
crime of conviction. The abstract of judgment is a court form that records
the judgment of conviction, with boxes for the code, section number and
crime of conviction. Although this form lists the crime as "TRANSPORT OR
SELL NARCOTIC CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE," the format of the form suggests this
phrasing is simply a recitation of the name of the violated statute, not an
attempt to describe the conduct to which Lee particularly pled. It does not
create ambiguity concerning the conduct to which Lee pled, particularly in
the face of [*792] the indictment and the change of plea minute order.
In sum, neither the sentencing court's failure to state special findings
on the record nor the abstract of judgment undermines the proof of Lee's
conviction for selling or offering to sell cocaine base. Accordingly, the
Alameda County conviction for violation of California Health and Safety Code
§ 11352 (a) qualifies as a predicate controlled substance offense.
IV.
We reject Lee's remaining argument that the district court abused its
discretion by refusing to provide a jury instruction on entrapment. The
district court found that Lee presented no evidence of inducement or lack of
predisposition. Lee did not introduce any evidence that the government
pressured him to sell cocaine or that he was reluctant to engage in the
crime. Thus, the court's finding was not "illogical, implausible, or without
support in inferences that may be drawn from the record." United States v. Hinkson , 585 F.3d 1247 , 1263 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc).
V.
Because Lee's San Francisco conviction does not qualify as a predicate
offense, we vacate Lee's sentence and remand [**6] for re-sentencing. On remand,
the district court should consider whether Lee's convictions under
California Penal Code § 69 and 243.1 constitute predicate offenses that, in
conjunction with Lee's Alameda County conviction, would qualify Lee as a
career offender.
SENTENCE VACATED and REMANDED.
[fn1] Young concerned eligibility for cancellation of removal in the
immigration context, where the burden is on the noncitizen to show that his
conviction was not for an aggravated felony. See Young , 697 F.3d at 988-90 .
The en banc court held that an inconclusive record of conviction did not
satisfy the noncitizen's burden. See id . In the criminal context, however,
the burden is on the government to establish that a prior conviction is a
qualifying predicate offense, see Crawford , 520 F.3d at 1078 , so an
inconclusive record will not satisfy the government's burden.
[fn2] Lee argues that offer[ing] to sell" should not be considered a
controlled substance offense because it describes merely a solicitation
offense, citing United States v. Dolt , 27 F.3d 235 , 240 (6th Cir.1994)
(holding that a solicitation conviction does not qualify as a controlled
substance offense under the career offender guidelines), and United States v. Liranzo , 944 F.2d 73 , 79 (2d Cir.1991) (holding that a defendant's
conviction for criminal facilitation does not qualify as a controlled
substance offense). Under the law of this circuit, however, solicitation
qualifies as a controlled substance offense. See United States v. Shumate , 329 F.3d 1026 , 1031-32 (9th Cir.2003). As a three-judge panel, we are bound
by this precedent.
[fn3] These provisions of § 1203.073 were the same in 1998, when Lee
received his probation.
