The central issue is whether the information relevant to JB&#8217;s decision to have sexual relations includes the fact that the other person must be able to consent and gives and maintains consent throughout. If it does, then for JB to have capacity to make the decision for himself, he must be able to understand that information, retain that information and use and weigh that information. If JB is unable to do so, despite all practicable steps having been taken to help him, with the consequence that he lacks capacity to make a decision for himself to having sexual relations, then he will be deprived of all sexual relations, as no other person may consent on his behalf to him having such relations: section 27(1)(b) MCA.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Proceedings were commenced by the local authority in the Court of Protection seeking declarations as to JB&#8217;s capacity in various matters. By 15 July 2019, the date of the hearing before Roberts J, the local authority and the Official Solicitor, on behalf of JB as his litigation friend, had reached agreement on the majority of issues about JB&#8217;s capacity, including that he lacked capacity to conduct the proceedings and to make decisions relating to his residence, care and support, contact with others and as to his use of the internet and social media. There remained the issue, as formulated by the parties, as to whether JB, in order to have the capacity &#8220;to<span style="font-style:italic"> consent</span>&#8221; to sexual relations, must not only understand that <span style="font-style:italic">he</span> can give or withhold consent but must also understand that <span style="font-style:italic">the other person</span> must be able to consent and gives and maintains consent throughout. At the material time it was evident that because of an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, his mind or brain, JB did not have that understanding in relation to the consent of <span style="font-style:italic">the other person</span>. The judge identified the fundamental submission made on behalf of JB as being &#8220;that the consent of others is not relevant to the question of whether [he], or any other protected party, has capacity <span style="font-style:italic">to consent</span> to sexual relations&#8221; (see para 13, emphasis added). The local authority also formulated the issue in relation to JB&#8217;s capacity &#8220;to consent&#8221; but contended that a component of JB&#8217;s ability to consent was an understanding that the other person must be able to, and must in fact, consent. It was said that if this component was absent then sexual offences might be committed by JB and that to permit such a situation would be a derogation of responsibility by the Court of Protection.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The local authority appealed to the Court of Appeal with the leave of King LJ granted on 20 November 2019. Following a hearing on 3 March 2020, the Court of Appeal (Sir Andrew McFarlane, President of the Court of Protection, Singh LJ, and Baker LJ) handed down judgment on 11 June 2020: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2020/735" uk:canonical="[2020] EWCA Civ 735" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] EWCA Civ 735</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2021] Fam 37" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] Fam 37</ref>. Baker LJ delivered the lead judgment, with which the other members of the court agreed. He recast the relevant &#8220;decision&#8221; as being a decision to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">engage in</span>&#8221; sexual relations rather than a decision to &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">consent</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">to</span>&#8221; sexual relations (para 93). Baker LJ held (at para 94) that:</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;When the &#8216;decision&#8217; is expressed in those terms, it becomes clear that the &#8216;information relevant to the decision&#8217; inevitably includes the fact that any person with whom P engages in sexual activity must be able to consent to such activity and does in fact consent to it. Sexual relations between human beings are mutually consensual. It is one of the many features that makes us unique. A person who does not understand that sexual relations must only take place when, and only for as long as, the other person is consenting is unable to understand a fundamental part of the information relevant to the decision whether or not to engage in such relations.&#8221;</p>
	    </content>
	  </level>
	  <level>
	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaNoNumber">Accordingly, the appeal was allowed given that JB did not understand information which was relevant to the decision to engage in sexual relations, namely that the other person must be able to consent and gives and maintains consent throughout. The declaration that JB had capacity to consent to sexual relations was set aside, and an interim declaration was made under section 48 of the MCA that &#8220;there is reason to believe that JB lacked the capacity to decide whether to engage in sexual relations&#8221;. The question as to whether a final declaration should be made was remitted to the judge, who, it was anticipated, would consider it appropriate to seek supplemental evidence.</p>

On 13 April 2021, a panel of the Supreme Court (Lord Hodge, Lady Arden and Lord Hamblen) granted permission to appeal.</p>

Its work includes providing psychoeducational support to those with disabilities to enable them to have the same opportunity to enjoy safe and fulfilling intimate relationships as their non-disabled peers. Respond&#8217;s written submissions provided insight from the perspective of a charity devoted to the support of many individuals with conditions similar to JB&#8217;s.</p>

The local authority and the Official Solicitor jointly instructed Dr Susan Thrift, a consultant clinical psychologist, to assess JB&#8217;s capacity to make decisions as to various matters including consenting to sexual relations. They also jointly instructed another consultant clinical psychologist, Dr Jillian Peters, to provide her expert opinion as to various matters, such as whether JB poses a sexual risk to women or vulnerable women and, if so, the severity of the risk together with advice as to a programme of work that may ameliorate that risk. The summary of JB&#8217;s personal circumstances which is set out in this section of the judgment is taken from the reports of those two experts and from the judgments at first instance and in the Court of Appeal.</p>

Since May 2014 he has been living in a supported residential placement, funded by the local authority, which he shares with two others. The staff who support JB described him as &#8220;likeable&#8221;. It is important to JB that he feels liked and popular. Unfortunately, some of his behaviours, especially towards women, at times make him extremely unpopular with others, which causes him to feel &#8220;depressed and desperate&#8221;.</p>

His mother reported that he walked at eight months and by the age of two had a counting and reading ability equivalent to that of a four-year old. Unfortunately, in contrast to these positive early indicators, JB also experienced some subtle difficulties which in retrospect were indicators of the problems that lay ahead. For example, he required routines to be followed rigidly or he would become distressed and aggressive.</p>

During some months he would experience up to 180 tonic-clonic seizures. Due to his seizures JB has sustained multiple fractures and injuries throughout his life. He has been hospitalised many times. As a side effect of one of the many drug treatments, introduced in an attempt to reduce the high frequency of his seizures, JB developed tunnel vision and as a consequence was registered blind in January 2000.</p>

This has manifested itself in difficulties with learning and cognitive function. JB&#8217;s cognitive impairment has left him with marked problems with, for instance, organising visual material, learning new material, processing information well if he has to do it quickly, and adaptive functioning in respect of activities of daily living and social interactions. However, repeated analysis over the years has concluded that his global intellectual functioning is not at a level which would lead to an overall classification of a learning disability.</p>

The nature and degree of Asperger&#8217;s syndrome experienced by JB accounts for his inappropriate sexual behaviours, such as being obsessionally fixated on a particular woman, sending inappropriate sexual messages, inappropriate touching, and targeting the vulnerable. This syndrome as experienced by JB, on its own or in combination with his brain damage, also accounts for his behavioural difficulties from childhood including aggression both at home and at school. The records suggest that JB attempted to strangle a classmate at the age of ten following a dispute and that a similar episode occurred when he was aged 12/13.</p>

Dr Thrift is of the opinion that JB&#8217;s autism has meant that he has significant difficulty in understanding and/or interpreting the intentions, perspectives, needs and communications of others and that he lacks understanding of the need to adjust his behaviour accordingly. Based on this evidence, and by virtue of his autism, JB has a marked deficit in using and weighing information as to whether a woman would be giving and maintaining her consent throughout the sexual relations which JB wishes to initiate.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Dr Thrift considers that ASD is a lifelong condition and that it is highly unlikely to change much in its presentation, especially given the rigidity of thought processes associated with the condition. She states that her clinical experience and knowledge of research suggests that some environmental modifications can aid people with ASD, and that it is possible to teach some more concrete aspects of social interaction (for instance that one should not hug strangers but shake their hand; or that one should not stare at parts of people&#8217;s bodies) but it is very difficult to teach and &#8220;learn&#8221; subtle nuances in social interaction and communication, especially those relating to sexual behaviour. It also requires the person to be motivated to learn these things. She considered that JB&#8217;s marked deficits in social understanding and communication relating to his ASD and his associated rigidity of thinking are lifelong conditions which are unlikely to change. However, she accepted that behavioural modification is in principle possible for people with ASD, provided the person accepts that they must modify their behaviour. Dr Thrift considered that JB has no insight into the need to change his behaviours.</p>

JB expressed very clearly to Dr Thrift that he does not value the companionship aspects of a sexual relationship. She was of the opinion that JB finds it hard to understand that a potential partner may want this. Furthermore, JB made repeated comments to Dr Thrift about &#8220;becoming less picky&#8221; or &#8220;fussy&#8221; and that he &#8220;would have anyone&#8221;.

These reports suggests that, when previously attending events for people with learning disabilities, JB would make a &#8220;beeline&#8221; for highly vulnerable women which suggested to Dr Thrift that he is able to discern those with such vulnerabilities and weighs them in relation to his ability to be successful in his aim of having sex. Dr Thrift was careful to qualify her assessment by stating that this may not be related to a callous disregard for others, but rather to a lack of understanding of the needs of others as distinct from his own needs. However, it is apparent that JB targets the vulnerable and has a marked deficit in weighing whether the other person is able to consent.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In relation to risks to others Dr Thrift was of the opinion that these encompassed a risk of sexual assault by JB of vulnerable women (such as women with learning disabilities) and other women he has contact with in social situations (eg dance partners in a dance class). The risks were both to women who were familiar to him and unknown to him. The risks could range from non-consensual sexual touching to non-consensual sex. She considered that the severity of the assault was likely to increase with the vulnerability of the woman concerned, but that JB may also severely assault less vulnerable women whose intentions he has misunderstood.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The risks to JB include physical or psychological harm from others including relatives or friends of the potential victims, incarceration or hospitalisation, and loss of freedom and life choices for the future due to offending. Dr Thrift considered that, if he were incarcerated, there would be significant harm to his mental health given his ASD. There is also the risk of civil claims for compensation, though JB&#8217;s lack of financial resources may make such claims in practice improbable.</p>

A treatment plan has been prepared and kept under review, pursuant to which the first stage is to assess JB&#8217;s engagement and motivation for treatment. Treatment has been carried out, albeit disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic. <span style="font-family:Arial">JB has engaged in all sessions and was reported as progressing well with the initial stage, &#8220;having developed a positive working alliance and displaying increased motivation for treatment&#8221;.

	      <p class="ParaNoNumber">This principle requires all dealings with persons who have an impairment of, or a disturbance in the functioning of, the mind or brain to be based on the premise that every individual is competent until the contrary is proved. The burden of proof lies on the party asserting that a person does not have capacity. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities: see section 2(4). Competence is decision-specific so that capacity is judged in relation to the particular decision, transaction or activity involved. P may be capable of making some decisions, but not others. The presumption of competence operates alongside a clear system for determining incapacity, for which see sections 2-3 MCA.</p>

If P has capacity to make a decision then he or she has the right to make an unwise decision and to suffer the consequences if and when things go wrong. In this way P can learn from mistakes and thus attain a greater degree of independence.</p>

This is the broad approach adopted by the MCA, although understanding alone might not be enough to amount to capacity under the MCA. The MCA contemplates instances where a person can understand the nature and effects of the decision to be made, but the effects of his mental disability prevent him from using that information in the decision-making process: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(1)</ref>(c) of the MCA and <span style="font-style:italic">R v Cooper</span> at para 24.</p>

The &#8220;material time&#8221; within section 2(1) is decision-specific (see para 67 below). The question is whether P has capacity to make a specific decision at the time when it needs to be made. Ordinarily, as in this case, this will involve a general forward-looking assessment made at the date of the hearing. However, if there is evidence of fluctuating capacity then that will be an appropriate qualification to the assessment.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The first question is whether P is unable to make a decision for himself in relation to the matter. As McFarlane LJ stated in <span style="font-style:italic">York City Council v C </span>at para 37, &#8220;the court is charged in section 2(1), in relation to &#8216;a matter&#8217;, with evaluating an individual&#8217;s capacity &#8216;to make a decision for himself in relation to the matter&#8217;.&#8221; The focus is on the capacity to make a specific decision so that the determination of capacity under Part 1 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9" uk:canonical="2005 c. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">MCA 2005</ref> is decision-specific as the Court of Appeal stated in this case at para 91. The only statutory test is in relation to the ability to decide. In the context of sexual relations, the other vocabulary that has developed around the MCA, of &#8220;person-specific&#8221;, &#8220;act-specific&#8221;, &#8220;situation-specific&#8221; and &#8220;issue-specific&#8221;, should not be permitted to detract from that statutory test, though it may helpfully be used to identify a particular feature of the matter in respect of which a decision is to be made in an individual case. For instance, &#8220;the matter&#8221; in this case cannot be described as being &#8220;person-specific&#8221; as there is no identified person with whom JB wishes to engage in sexual relations.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Where the matter relates to sexual relations, it will ordinarily be formulated in a non-specific way because, in accordance with ordinary human experience, it will involve a forward-looking evaluation directed to the nature of the activity rather than to the identity of the sexual partner. Moreover, &#8220;[to] <span style="font-style:italic">require</span> the issue of capacity to be considered in respect of every person with whom P contemplated sexual relations would not only be impracticable but would also constitute a great intrusion into P&#8217;s private life&#8221; (emphasis added): see <span style="font-style:italic">A Local Authority v TZ</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewcop/2013/2322" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCOP 2322" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 2322 (COP)</ref>, para 23. A general non-specific formulation of &#8220;the matter&#8221; is also informed by considerations of pragmatism, as recognised by Sir Brian Leveson P, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, in <span style="font-style:italic">In re M (An Adult) (Capacity: Consent to Sexual Relations)</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2014/37" uk:canonical="[2014] EWCA Civ 37" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] EWCA Civ 37</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] Fam 61" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] Fam 61</ref>, para 77. However, I respectfully disagree with the statement (in para 77) that &#8220;capacity to consent to future sexual relations can <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> be assessed on a general and non-specific basis&#8221; (emphasis added). Pragmatism does not <span style="font-style:italic">require</span> that consent to future sexual relations can only be assessed on a general and non-specific basis. Furthermore, such a restriction on the formulation of the matter is contrary to the open-textured nature of section 2(1) MCA. A general and non-specific basis is not the only appropriate formulation in respect of sexual relations as even in that context, &#8220;the matter&#8221; can be person-specific where it involves, for instance, sexual relations between a couple who have been in a long-standing relationship where one of them develops dementia or sustains a significant traumatic brain injury. It could also be person-specific in the case of sexual relations between two individuals who are mutually attracted to one another but who both have impairments of the functioning of their minds.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">If the formulation of &#8220;the matter&#8221; for decision can properly be described as person-specific, then the information relevant to the decision may be different, for instance depending on the characteristics of the other person, see <span style="font-style:italic">TZ</span> at para 55 (risk of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse is not relevant to a decision whether or not to engage in, or consent to, sexual relations with someone of the same sex) or the risks posed to P by an individual who has been convicted of serious sexual offences, see <span style="font-style:italic">York City Council v C</span> at para 39. Moreover, the practicable steps which must be taken to help P under section 1(3) MCA may be informed by whether &#8220;the matter&#8221; in relation to sexual relations may be described as person-specific. For instance, it might be possible to help P to understand the response of one potential sexual partner in circumstances where he will remain unable to understand the diverse responses of many hypothetical sexual partners. Furthermore, if the matter can be described as person-specific then the reasonably foreseeable consequences of deciding one way or another (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/3/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3(4)</ref>(a) MCA and para 73 below) may be different. There may, for example, be no reasonably foreseeable consequence of a sexually transmitted disease in a long-standing monogamous relationship where one partner has developed dementia. Finally, the potential for &#8220;serious grave consequences&#8221; may also differ (see para 74 below).</p>

Given that lack of authority, the Court of Appeal considered that the correct formulation of &#8220;the matter&#8221; related to JB engaging in sexual relations. The Court of Appeal recognised, at para 99, that in recasting the decision as the decision to <span style="font-style:italic">engage in</span> sexual relations that it &#8220;was moving on from the previous case law&#8221; which <span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">had focused on the capacity to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">consent to</span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif"> sexual relations.

The ability to choose whether or not to engage in sexual activity or intercourse is close to the Court of Appeal&#8217;s formulation of &#8220;engaging in&#8221; sexual relations. It may be helpful to observe that the terminology of a capacity to decide to &#8220;engage in&#8221; sexual relations embraces both (i) P&#8217;s capacity to consent to sexual relations initiated by the other party and (ii) P&#8217;s capacity to understand that, in relation to sexual relations initiated by P, the other party must be able to consent to sexual relations and must in fact be consenting, and consenting throughout, to the sexual relations.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Mr McKendrick argued that even if &#8220;the matter&#8221; for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 2</ref> MCA was whether to engage in sexual relations then information relevant to JB&#8217;s decision did not include the fact that the other person must have the ability to consent to the sexual activity and must in fact consent before and throughout the sexual activity. Mr McKendrick argued that this inappropriately extended the requisite information in order to protect the other person or members of the public. He submitted that this was not the purpose of the MCA, which was confined to the protection of P, and did not extend to the protection of members of the public. Moreover, he contended that the protection of the public was the purpose of the criminal law and that such protection could also be obtained by making a sexual risk order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42/section/122" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 122</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/42" uk:canonical="2003 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Sexual Offences Act 2003</ref>. I disagree. The information relevant to the decision includes information about the &#8220;reasonably foreseeable consequences&#8221; of a decision, or of failing to make a decision, which consequences are not limited to the consequences for P: see para 73 above. The consequences for other persons or for members of the public are therefore a part of the information relevant to the decision. Furthermore, I agree with the Court of Appeal, at para 6, that:</p>

Mr McKendrick contends that to take such an understanding into account is impermissibly person-specific. </span>I reject this contention. First, the statutory test is decision-specific: see para 67 above. Second, the issues in this case (but, as I have stressed at paras 71-72 above, the position can be different in other cases) do not relate to sexual relations with any particular person. What is required is a generalised forward-looking evaluation in relation to JB&#8217;s capacity to have sexual relations with any woman. The inclusion of the consent of the other in the relevant information for the purposes of that evaluation does not introduce the specific characteristics of any individual person into the evaluation, but instead reflects the consensual nature of all sexual activity. It is not, therefore, &#8220;person-specific.&#8221; I accordingly agree with the Court of Appeal at para 95 that &#8220;The inclusion of an understanding of the other person's consent as part of the relevant information does not, &#8230; recast the test as &#8216;person-specific&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Mr McKendrick also argued that if the information relevant to the decision to engage in sexual relations includes the fact that the other person must have the ability to consent to the sexual activity and must in fact consent before and throughout the sexual activity, then the concepts involved are too extensive and nebulous for JB or for others with mental impairments to understand. Accordingly, he argued, JB and others were being set up to fail. The appellant was supported in this submission by Respond&#8217;s submission that the Court of Appeal had promulgated &#8220;an elevated abstract test&#8221; which was likely to give rise to problems in real life situations. Respond submitted that a less abstract, more situation-specific test, and one that is less complex and does not require an assessment of the capacity of a proposed partner to consent, is more likely to preserve P&#8217;s right to a sexual life. Mr McKendrick relied in this respect on the legal complexities surrounding the criminal law concept of consent. He referred the court to Crown Court Compendium 2020, Part 1 at p 480 which lists eight ways in which the absence of consent may be proved and suggested that this would present an insurmountable hurdle for the potentially incapacitous. However, that is not the sort of refined analysis which typically informs the decision to engage in sexual relations made by a person of full capacity (see para 77 above)<span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif">. </span><span style="font-family:Calibri, sans-serif;color:#000000">A potentially incapacitous person is simply required to understand that the other person must be able to consent and does in fact consent throughout. For my part the only alteration that needs to be made to the summary of the information relevant to the decision to engage in sexual relations, set out by the Court of Appeal (see para 84 above) is to change the words &#8220;must have capacity to&#8221; in (2) to &#8220;must be able to&#8221;. Subject to that change, I consider that the concepts are not too nebulous or refined, nor do they amount to an elevated abstract test, nor do they require a detailed understanding of the Crown Court Compendium.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Mr McKendrick also submitted that sexual activity, and decisions about engaging in sexual relations for a person of full capacity, are largely visceral rather than cerebral, owing more to instinct and emotion than to analysis. On this basis he argued that to include as part of the information relevant to the decision the fact that the other person must have the capacity to consent to the sexual activity and must in fact consent before and throughout the sexual activity imposes a discriminatory cerebral analysis on the potentially incapacitous. I reject that submission. As the Court of Appeal observed, at para 96, &#8220;amongst the matters which <span style="font-style:italic">every person</span> engaging in sexual relations must think about is whether the other person is consenting&#8221; (emphasis added). If that is properly viewed as cerebral or as involving a degree of analysis, a decision to engage in sexual relations is necessarily cerebral or analytical to that extent.</p>

The question arises under this ground of appeal as to whether either of those matters creates an &#8220;impermissible&#8221; difference between the civil and criminal law. </p>

The primary purpose of the criminal law is the prosecution of behaviour that is classified as criminal and the punishment of offenders by the state. In civil proceedings under the MCA the courts must balance the promotion of the autonomy of vulnerable persons with their protection from harm, all while, so far as required by general principles of law and the court&#8217;s obligations as a public authority under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref>, having regard to the rights of others. Viewed in this way, the differences between criminal proceedings and civil proceedings under the MCA suggest that it may be permissible to adopt different tests of capacity in the civil and the criminal law.</span></p>

These sections deal respectively with sexual activity with a person with a mental disorder impeding choice (section 30); causing or inciting a person, with a mental disorder impeding choice, to engage in sexual activity (section 31); engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a person with a mental disorder impeding choice (section 32); and causing a person, with a mental disorder impeding choice, to watch a sexual act (section 33). In relation to each of these offences, if P is the complainant (i.e., the victim of the criminal offending), there is a materially identical provision to the effect that P is to be taken to be unable to refuse if &#8220;he lacks the capacity to choose whether to [do the material thing] (<span style="font-style:italic">whether because he lacks sufficient understanding of the nature or reasonably foreseeable consequences of what is being done, or for any other reason</span>)&#8221; (emphasis added). Macur LJ giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">R v A (G)</span> at paras 24 and 25 stated that the words to which I have added emphasis &#8220;reflect the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 2(1)</ref> and 3(1) of the [MCA]&#8221;. This led her to determine that &#8220;the difference in definition of capacity in the civil and criminal jurisprudence is a difference without distinction.&#8221; Although the wording in sections 30-33 SOA is different, I agree that the definition in those sections reflects the provisions of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/9/section/2/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 2(1)</ref> and 3(1) MCA. However, I respectfully do not agree that this is &#8220;a difference without distinction&#8221;. For instance, in the context of the MCA, information relevant to the decision to &#8220;engage in&#8221; sexual relations includes the fact that <span style="font-style:italic">the other person</span> must have the ability to consent to the sexual activity and must in fact consent before and throughout the sexual activity. P lacks capacity if P is unable to understand that information or if he is unable to use or weigh it as part of the decision-making process. However, to my mind that aspect of capacity is irrelevant in the context of sections 30-33 SOA provided P is the complainant rather than the alleged perpetrator (I deal in para 117 below with where P is the alleged perpetrator). In that criminal context P&#8217;s capacity to consent would not include a sufficient understanding by him of the fact that the alleged perpetrator (that is, the other person) must have the ability to consent to the sexual activity and must in fact consent before and throughout the sexual activity.</p>

These are two different concepts. The capacity to &#8220;engage in&#8221; sexual relations encompasses both P as the initiator of those relations and P as the person consenting to sexual relations initiated by another. The information relevant to a decision whether to initiate sexual relations includes the fact that the other person must have the ability to consent to the sexual activity and must in fact consent before and throughout the sexual activity. That is not information relevant to an evaluation of whether P has the capacity to &#8220;consent to&#8221; sexual relations initiated by another person. As the Court of Appeal stated in this case (at para 93) &#8220;The word "consent" implies agreeing to sexual relations proposed by someone else.&#8221; The capacity to consent to sexual relations for the purposes of the criminal law is concerned with the understanding of the complainant (whom I have been referring to as P) about matters which are relevant to their autonomy, not those which are relevant to the autonomy of the alleged perpetrator. I do not consider that the criminal law requires that a complainant understands that their assailant must have the capacity to consent and in fact consents before the complainant can be considered to have capacity. I do not discern any difference in this regard between the civil and criminal law.</span></p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">If P is accused of a sexual offence, then section 1(1)(c) SOA (for example in respect of rape) requires the prosecution to prove that &#8220;A does not reasonably believe that B consents&#8221;. A is here the person who I have been referring to as P. Section 1(2) provides that &#8220;Whether a belief is reasonable is to be determined having regard to all the circumstances, including any steps A has taken to ascertain whether B consents.&#8221; The question arises as to whether the clarification of the law so as to include in the information under the MCA the fact that the other person must have the ability to consent to the sexual activity and must in fact consent before and throughout the sexual activity creates an impermissible difference with these sections. Mr McKendrick argues that it does, on the basis that the Court of Appeal&#8217;s approach requires more of P than the criminal law requires in relation to sexual offences. That, he submits, is because under the criminal law an accused is not guilty if the accused reasonably believes that the complainant was consenting, whereas he suggests that a higher standard is applied to P if P is required to understand, retain, use or weigh information which includes the fact that the other person must have the ability to consent to the sexual activity and must in fact consent before and throughout the sexual activity.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I consider this to be a distinction without a difference. An accused may have a reasonable belief that the complainant was consenting, but the accused in that situation will understand that the complainant was able to and must consent throughout and the accused has to use or weigh that information as part of the process of forming a reasonable belief. If P is able to understand the fact that the other person must have the ability to consent to the sexual activity and must in fact consent before and throughout the sexual activity, and if P is able to use or weigh that information as part of the process of making the decision as to whether to engage in sexual relations, then P is in the same position as an accused in the criminal context. I am therefore not persuaded that there are any unnecessary differences in this regard as between the civil or criminal law (which in any event need not be identical).</p>

On two occasions the accused had sexual intercourse with the complainant, allegedly without her consent. At his trial on two counts of rape there was expert medical evidence that the accused had a mental disorder, probably paranoid schizophrenia, at the time of the offences. The expert said that the acts of sexual intercourse might have been motivated by the defendant&#8217;s delusional beliefs that he had sexual healing powers, but that any such delusions had not affected his ability to understand whether the complainant was consenting. In directing the jury, the judge said that when determining whether the defendant had had a reasonable belief in the complainant&#8217;s consent for the purposes of section 1(1) SOA they should ignore the defendant&#8217;s mental illness. The conviction was upheld on appeal. The Court of Appeal held (at para 40) that unless and until the state of mind amounts to insanity in law, then under the rule enacted in the SOA, beliefs in consent arising from conditions such as delusional psychotic illness or personality disorders must be judged by objective standards of reasonableness. The case did not concern any potential differences between the civil and criminal law in relation to the test for capacity. However, the Court of Appeal discussed (at para 41) a potential future case in which an accused in JB&#8217;s position had demonstrated an inability to recognise subtle social signals. The Court of Appeal stated that whether such an inability could be relevant to the reasonableness of a belief in consent &#8220;must await a decision on specific facts&#8221;.

For instance, section 31 creates the offence of &#8220;causing or inciting a person, with a mental disorder impeding choice, to engage in sexual activity&#8221;. I consider that the concept of engaging in sexual activity is a descriptor of the actus reus of that offence and is consistent with the clarification of the law in respect of the MCA which also uses the concept of engaging in sexual relations.

Furthermore, section 1(3) MCA provides that a person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success which ensures that the interference with article 8, if it is engaged, is proportionate.

The respondent points out that, as a result of the way in which the case was run, no factual findings were made which are capable of supporting an assertion of breach of JB&#8217;s article 8 rights. Nor does this court have a complete factual picture as to what is happening on the ground in relation to JB including, significantly, the steps which are being taken: (1) to support him to gain capacity to make decisions in relation to sexual relations (in circumstances where the Court of Appeal only made an <span style="font-style:italic">interim</span> declaration that there was reason to believe that he lacked capacity to decide whether to engage in sexual relations); and (2) the steps being taken to secure his ability to develop safe relationships with women, including the ongoing education being provided by a clinical psychologist. I consider that this objection has considerable force. But in any event, any interference would be in accordance with the MCA, and therefore in accordance with the law. Furthermore, a legitimate aim of any interference with JB&#8217;s article 8 rights, if that article is engaged, would be the protection of the health, both mental and physical, of both JB and of others. Other legitimate aims would be the protection of the rights and freedom of others as well as the prevention of disorder or crime. There have been no factual findings in relation to the proportionality of any interference in pursuit of those legitimate aims. For all these reasons I would refuse permission to raise this argument.</p>
