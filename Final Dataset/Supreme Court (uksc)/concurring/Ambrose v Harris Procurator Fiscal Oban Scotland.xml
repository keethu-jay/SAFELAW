	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 26 October 2010 this Court issued its judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder v HM Advocate</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2010/43" uk:canonical="[2010] UKSC 43" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] UKSC 43</ref>, 2010 SLT 1125. It held that the Crown&#8217;s reliance on admissions made by an accused without legal advice when detained under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46/section/14" uk:canonical="1995 c. 46 s. 14" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 14</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46" uk:canonical="1995 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995</ref> gave rise to a breach of his right to a fair trial, having regard to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz v Turkey</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2008) 49 EHRR 421" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">(2008) 49 EHRR 421</ref>. This was because the leading and relying on the evidence of the appellant&#8217;s interview by the police was a violation of his rights under article 6(3)(c) read in conjunction with article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights: see <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder v HM Advocate</span>, para 63.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence that was in question in <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder</span> had been obtained when the appellant was being questioned while in detention at a police station. The applicant in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> too had been taken into custody before he was interrogated during his detention by police officers of the anti-terrorism branch of the Izmir Security Directorate. But the facts of those cases by no means exhaust the situations in which the prosecution may seek to rely on answers to questions that have been put to the accused by the police. The Court now has before it four references by judges of the High Court of Justiciary which have been required by the Lord Advocate under paragraph 33 of Schedule 6 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/46" uk:canonical="1998 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Scotland Act 1998</ref>. Common to them all is the fact that incriminating answers were given to questions put by the police when the accused did not have access to legal advice. In three of them the evidence that is objected to was obtained by the police otherwise than by questioning at a police station following detention under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 14</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46" uk:canonical="1995 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1995 Act</ref>. They can be grouped together and are the subject of this judgment. The fourth is concerned with the question whether the ratio of the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> extends to lines of enquiry to which the accused&#8217;s answers to questions while in detention have given rise. That reference is dealt with in a separate judgment: <span style="font-style:italic">P v HM Advocate</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2011/44" uk:canonical="[2011] UKSC 44" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKSC 44</ref>.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The issues that the first three references raise are (1) whether the right of access to a lawyer prior to police questioning, which was established by <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, applies only to questioning which takes place when the person has been taken into police custody; and (2) if the rule applies at some earlier stage, from what moment does it apply. The first reference is of a case which is the subject of an appeal against conviction. The second is of a case which is before the Appeal Court in an appeal against a ruling by a sheriff on the admissibility of evidence. The third is of case which is the subject of a devolution minute which was referred by the trial judge to the Appeal Court under paragraph 9 of Schedule 6 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/46" uk:canonical="1998 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Scotland Act 1998</ref>. The cases that are the subject of the second and third references that have not yet gone to trial, so the names of the parties involved have been anonymised. In each case the reference has been made by the Appeal Court at the request of the Lord Advocate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant in the first case, John Paul Ambrose, was prosecuted on summary complaint at Oban Sheriff Court on a charge of contravening <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/52/section/5/1" uk:canonical="1988 c. 52 s. 5" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5(1)</ref>(b) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/52" uk:canonical="1988 c. 52" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Road Traffic Act 1988</ref> as being in charge of a motor vehicle whilst having consumed a level of alcohol in excess of the prescribed limit. He had been found by two police officers sitting in the passenger seat of a car parked by the roadside. A female was sitting in the driver&#8217;s seat. A member of the public had expressed concerns to the police about them because they were thought to be drunk. As there was vomit beside the driver&#8217;s door and the female was seen to be upset, the police officers decided to speak to the appellant. Having formed the view that he had been drinking, one of the police officers cautioned the appellant but did not give him any specification about the offence which he was suspected of having committed. The appellant made no reply when cautioned. He was then asked three questions, to which he gave answers, by the police. They were as follows:</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">The appellant then removed the car keys from his trouser pocket. He was asked whether he had anything to drink in the last 20 minutes and replied that he had not. He was then given a roadside breath test which he failed. He was taken to Oban police station where he gave a breath/alcohol reading that was well in excess of the prescribed limit.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant pled not guilty to the complaint. He went to trial before a Sheriff on 31 May 2010 and 2 July 2010. The evidence of the questions and answers was led without objection from his solicitor. After the Crown had closed its case the appellant&#8217;s solicitor challenged the admissibility of this evidence on the ground that the police had not informed the appellant of the offence of which he was suspected before he was questioned. The sheriff repelled this submission. After hearing evidence from the appellant and a defence witness, he found the appellant guilty. He was fined &#163;375, was disqualified from driving for two years and had his licence endorsed. The appellant then lodged an appeal against his conviction. Among the grounds on which he applied for a stated case was the submission that the act of the Lord Advocate in seeking a conviction in reliance on the evidence of the police interview was incompatible with his right to a fair trial under article 6(1). Leave to appeal having been refused at the first sift, he appealed to the second sift and then lodged a devolution minute in which it was stated that for the Lord Advocate to support the conviction would be incompatible with his rights under article 6(1) and article 6(3)(c). In a note which he lodged on 12 October 2010 in support of the appeal he submitted, with reference to the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, that the use of the evidence of the interview was unfair as he did not have access to legal representation before or during the police interview. On 3 November 2010 leave to appeal was granted at the second sift.</p>

Shortly after the assault took place on 30 August 2008, in the course of initial inquiries, the police took the accused&#8217;s details from him but allowed him to leave the locus. On 4 September 2008 however he was traced to his home address where, after administering a common law caution to the effect that he was not required to say anything but that anything he did say might be used in evidence, a police officer asked a total of seven questions, each of which was answered by the accused. They were as follows:</p>

When the minute was argued before the sheriff on 9 November 2010 the Crown conceded that the evidence of the admissions made during the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 14</ref> interview was inadmissible. But the sheriff ruled that evidence relating to the questions and answers at the accused&#8217;s home on 4 September 2008 was admissible. The accused appealed against that decision to the High Court of Justiciary, contending that by failing to allow him access to legal advice prior to interview and there being no compelling reasons to justify this, his admissions allegedly obtained under caution had been unfairly obtained and were therefore inadmissible.</p>

They are set out in a schedule which was completed as the search of the flat was carried out. Without that evidence there would not be sufficient evidence to convict the accused. The accused has lodged a devolution minute in which he contends that the leading of evidence of the statements and answers which he made at the premises would be incompatible with his Convention right to a fair trial. The trial judge decided to refer this issue to the Appeal Court under paragraph 9 of Schedule 6 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/46" uk:canonical="1998 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Scotland Act 1998</ref>.

Unless all three features are present, he has no right of access to legal advice under article 6. These propositions all assume, of course, that the court finds that article 6(1) was engaged when the incriminating statements were made. This is because the protection of articles 6(1) and 6(3)(c) is afforded only to those who have been &#8220;charged&#8221;, as that word has been interpreted by the Strasbourg court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Two very important points need, however, to be made at the outset. The first is that the jurisdiction of this court is limited to a consideration of the devolution issue which is raised by each of these references. That is plain from the wording of paragraph 33 of Schedule 6 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/46" uk:canonical="1998 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Scotland Act 1998</ref> under which the references have been made, but it needs to be emphasised yet again. The High Court of Justiciary is the court of last resort in all criminal matters in Scotland: see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46/section/124/2" uk:canonical="1995 c. 46 s. 124" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 124(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46" uk:canonical="1995 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995</ref>; <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes v HM Advocate</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2010/7" uk:canonical="[2010] UKSC 7" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] UKSC 7</ref>, 2010 SLT 266, para 5, <span style="font-style:italic">Fraser v HM Advocate</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2011/24" uk:canonical="[2011] UKSC 24" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] UKSC 24</ref>, 2011 SLT 515, para 11. It is not our function to rule on how the circumstances referred to in each case would fall to be dealt with under domestic law, although this does form part of the background.</p>

	  <num style="font-size:13pt">15.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The second point is that a decision by this court that there is a rule that a person who is suspected of an offence but is not yet in custody has a right of access to a lawyer before being questioned by the police unless there are compelling reasons to restrict that right would have far-reaching consequences. There is no such rule in domestic law: see para 22, below. If that is what Strasbourg requires, then it would be difficult for us to avoid holding that to deny such a person access to a lawyer would be a breach of his rights under articles 6(1) and 6(3)(c) of the Convention. But the consequences of such a ruling would be profound, as the answers to police questioning in such circumstances would always have to be held &#8211; in the absence of compelling reasons for restricting access to a lawyer &#8211; to be inadmissible. The effect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/46/section/57/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 46 s. 57" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 57(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/46" uk:canonical="1998 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Scotland Act 1998</ref> would be that the Lord Advocate would have no power to lead that evidence. I agree with Lord Matthew Clarke that this would have serious implications for the investigation of crime by the authorities: see para 116, below.<span style="font-size:12pt"/>This suggests that a judgment pointing unequivocally to that conclusion would be required to justify taking that step. If Strasbourg has not yet spoken clearly enough on this issue, the wiser course must surely be to wait until it has done so.</p>

From that it followed that a national court should not without strong reason dilute or weaken the effect of the Strasbourg case law. It was its duty to keep pace with it as it evolved over time. There is, on the other hand, no obligation on the national court to do more than that. As Lord Bingham observed, it is open to member states to provide for rights more generous than those guaranteed by the Convention. But such provision should not be the product of interpretation of the Convention by national courts.</p>

Thus particular regard must be had and reliance placed on the express terms of the Convention, which define the rights and freedoms which the contracting parties have undertaken to secure. This does not mean that nothing can be implied into the Convention. The language of the Convention is for the most part so general that some implication of terms is necessary, and the case law of the European Court shows that the court has been willing to imply terms into the Convention when it was judged necessary or plainly right to do so. But the process of implication is one to be carried out with caution, if the risk is to be averted that the contracting parties may, by judicial interpretation, become bound by obligations which they did not expressly accept and might not have been willing to accept. As an important constitutional instrument the Convention is to be seen as a &#8216;living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits&#8217; (<span style="font-style:italic">Edwards v Attorney General for Canada</span> (<ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1930] AC 124" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1930">[1930] AC 124</ref>) at p 136 per Lord Sankey LC), but those limits will often call for very careful consideration.&#8221;</p>

Lord Kerr doubts whether Lord Bingham intended that his discussion of the issue should have the effect of acting as an inhibitor on courts of this country giving full effect to Convention rights unless they had been pronounced upon by Strasbourg: para 128, below. I, for my part, would hesitate to attribute to him an approach to the issue which he did not himself ever express and which, moreover, would be at variance with what he himself actually said. Lord Bingham&#8217;s point, with which I respectfully agree, was that Parliament never intended to give the courts of this country the power to give a more generous scope to those rights than that which was to be found in the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court. To do so would have the effect of changing them from Convention rights, based on the treaty obligation, into free-standing rights of the court&#8217;s own creation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The powers of the police to detain a person and to subject him to questioning depend on the category into which the person falls at the time these powers are being exercised. They differ according to whether the person is a witness, a suspect or an accused. Where a person is not under suspicion, the police have no power to take him into custody or to compel him to submit to police questioning. Such a person is classified, at most, as a witness. A person who is in that category can be asked to provide personal information, such as his name and address. Further questions may be put as part of a routine investigation into the events that have happened. So long as he is being questioned as a potential witness rather than as a suspect, the right to protection against self-incrimination is not in play. There is no obligation to advise him of his rights, such as the right to silence or his right to seek legal advice. As Lord Justice Clerk Thomson said in <span style="font-style:italic">Chalmers v HM Advocate</span> 1954 JC 66, 81, a person ultimately accused may be interviewed as part of the ordinary routine investigation of the police into the circumstances of the crime. It would unduly hamper the investigation of crime if the threat of inadmissibility were to tie the hands of the police in asking questions at this stage. </p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">It was for a time thought that this passage was to be taken to establish that answers by suspects to police questioning were inadmissible by virtue of the person&#8217;s position as a person under serious consideration as the perpetrator of the crime. But, as the law has developed, the position is less easy to define: see Renton and Brown, <span style="font-style:italic">Criminal Procedure</span>, 6th ed looseleaf (1996), para 24-38. In <span style="font-style:italic">Miln v Cullen</span> 1967 JC 21 it was held that the incriminating answers which the driver of a car gave when questioned by police officers who had formed the opinion that he was under the influence of drink were admissible in evidence. Lord Justice Clerk Grant said at p 25 that the constable, in asking the simple question whether he was the driver, was not merely acting reasonably, properly and fairly but was acting in accordance with the duties incumbent upon him. Lord Wheatley said at pp 30-31 that it was difficult to define with exactitude when a person becomes a suspect in the eyes of a police officer, as it may vary from a very slight suspicion to a clearly informed one, and that what happened after that had to be judged by the test of fairness.</p>

(see the opinion of the Lord Justice General (Clyde) in <span style="font-style:italic">Brown v HM Advocate</span> 1966 SLT 105 at 107). In each case where the admissibility of answers by a suspect to police questioning becomes an issue it will be necessary to consider the whole relevant circumstances in order to discover whether or not there has been unfairness on the part of the police resulting in the extraction from the suspect of the answers in question.&#8221;</p>

The current position as described in Renton and Brown, para 24-39 is therefore that the fact that the accused was at the time under suspicion or even under arrest is not in itself crucial. It is merely a circumstance like any other to be taken into account in assessing the fairness of the police questioning.</p>

The background to the legislation was described with characteristic skill and attention to detail by Lord Rodger in <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder</span>, para 74-86. As he explained in para 86, one aim was to put an end to the doubts about the legal basis for holding suspects for questioning when they had not been arrested. Another was to clarify the law as to the power of the police to question suspects and as to the admissibility of any answers that the suspects gave to such questions. A person may be detained for the purpose of carrying out investigations where a constable has reasonable grounds for suspecting that he has committed or is committing an offence punishable by imprisonment: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46/section/14/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 14(1)</ref>.

The domestic law test for the admissibility of the answers that were given to the questions put by the police is whether or not there was unfairness on the part of the police. The fact that the person did not have access to legal advice when being questioned is a circumstance to which the court may have regard in applying the test of fairness, but it is no more than that. There is no rule in domestic law that says that police questioning of a person without access to legal advice who is suspected of an offence but is not in custody must always be regarded as unfair. The question is whether a rule to that effect is to be found, with a sufficient degree of clarity, in the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court.</p>

Some of the propositions that are set out in its judgment are expressed in a way that might suggest that the right of access to a lawyer is not confined to persons who are subjected to police questioning while they are in custody. Para 55 of the judgment is in these terms:</p>
	    <block name="embeddedStructure"><embeddedStructure>
		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;Against this background, the Court finds that in order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently &#8216;practical and effective&#8217; article 6(1) requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police, unless it is demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances of each case that there are compelling reasons to restrict this right. Even where compelling reasons may exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer, such restriction &#8211; whatever its justification &#8211; must not unduly prejudice the rights of the accused under article 6. The rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">Read on its own, and without taking full account of the context in which these sentences were written, that paragraph suggests that the features which determine whether access to legal advice is to be provided are (a) that the person is a suspect, and (b) that he is subject to police interrogation. No mention is made in this paragraph of his being in police custody. The fact is, however, that the applicant was in police custody when he was interrogated by the police. The narrative of the facts in paras 12-14 shows that it was not until after he had been taken into custody by police officers from the Anti-Terrorism Branch of the Izmir Security Directorate that he was interrogated. That being so, it is necessary to look elsewhere in the judgment to see whether the court was contemplating anything other than an interrogation in police custody when it came to set out what it did in para 55 of the judgment.</p>

The reason why this had not been provided to the applicant was that the legislation did not apply to persons accused of offences falling within the jurisdiction of the state security courts, which his offence did. The challenge, therefore, was to a systematic departure from the right of access to a lawyer which the law gave to everyone else. In its examination of recent amendments in paras 29-31 of the judgment too its focus was on provisions that deal with juveniles taken into police custody.</p>

Chapter 1 of that Part refers to materials from the Council of Europe and the United Nations dealing with procedure in juvenile cases where the child had been deprived of his liberty by means of pre-trial detention. The heading of Chapter 2 is &#8220;Right of access to a lawyer during police custody&#8221;. Reference is made in para 37 of the judgment to rule 93 of the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners adopted by the Council of Europe Ministers, which states that an untried prisoner shall be entitled as soon as he is imprisoned to choose his legal representatives and to receive visits from his legal adviser, and, in para 38, to a recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States of the Council of Europe dealing with the right of prisoners to legal advice. There is no sign here or in its examination of the United Nations materials in paras 41-42 that the Grand Chamber was interested in the position of suspects who were questioned by the police when not in custody. Nor is there any sign of an international consensus that there is a right of access to a lawyer at that stage.</p>

The first section, which is headed &#8220;Access to a lawyer during police custody&#8221;, continues to para 63. It includes para 55, which I have already quoted: see para 26, above. In para 45 it is stated that the applicant&#8217;s allegation was that his defence rights had been violated as he had been denied access to a lawyer during his police custody. The parties&#8217; submissions, as narrated in paras 47-49 were directed to this issue. There then follows a discussion of the general principles which were applicable to the case: paras 50-55. In this passage, to which I will return, the court does not, at least in so many words, limit its scrutiny of the principles to what they require in cases where the person concerned is in police custody. But in the next section, where it applies the principles to the case of applicant, the fact that he was in police custody lies at the heart of the discussion; paras 56-62. The holding in para 80 states that there had been a violation of the applicant&#8217;s rights under article 6(1) in conjunction with article 6(3)(c) on account of the lack of legal assistance while he was in police custody.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">But for the discussion of the relevant principles in paras 50-55, which is not so limited, there would be no doubt at all that the Grand Chamber&#8217;s declaration in the last sentence of para 55 that the rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction was directed to the situation where that interrogation took place while the person was in police custody. That is the conclusion that one would naturally draw from the context. The concurring opinions of Judge Bratza and Judge Zagrebelsky lend further support to this conclusion. Judge Bratza said in para O-I2 that, like Judge Zagrebelsky, he thought that the court should have used the opportunity to state in clear terms that the fairness of criminal proceedings under article 6 required that, as a rule, a suspect should be granted legal advice &#8220;from the moment he is taken into police custody or pre-trial detention.&#8221; No mention is made in either of these opinions of any rule to the effect that the suspect should be granted legal advice at any earlier stage. It may be, as Lord Rodger suggested in <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder</span>, para 70, that what these judges were contemplating was legal assistance for other purposes such as support for an accused who was distressed or to check on the conditions of detention. Whatever the reason, they were plainly not addressing their remarks to situations such as those described in the references where the questioning took place before the suspect was taken into police custody.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The discussion of the general principles in paras 50-55 is not limited in this way. As para 50 makes clear, the fact that the applicant&#8217;s case was concerned with pre-trial proceedings did not mean that article 6 had no application. The point is made that the fairness of a trial may be seriously prejudiced by an initial failure to comply with its provisions. In para 51 reference is made to the right of everyone charged with a criminal offence to be effectively defended by a lawyer, the choice of means of ensuring this being left to the contracting states. The paragraph ends with a warning that assigning counsel does not in itself ensure the effectiveness of the assistance he may afford an accused. So far there is nothing to suggest that the Grand Chamber was searching for a basis for a ruling that the right of access to a lawyer arose at a stage before the suspect was taken into police custody. In para 52 reference is made for the first time to the attitude of the accused at the initial stages of police interrogation and to the fact that article 6 will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer at this stage. No mention is made of where he was assumed to be when he is being questioned, but the cases referred to in the footnote to this paragraph are all cases where the applicant was in custody when he was subjected to interrogation by the police: <span style="font-style:italic">Murray v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1996) 22 EHRR 29" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">(1996) 22 EHRR 29</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">Brennan v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2001) 34 EHRR 507" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">(2001) 34 EHRR 507</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Magee v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2000) 31 EHRR 822" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">(2000) 31 EHRR 822</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In para 53 it is stated that the principles outlined in the previous paragraph are also in line with the generally accepted international human rights standards which, as the footnote to this paragraph indicates, are those set out in Part B of the judgment: see para 28, above. These are said to be at the core of the concept of a fair trial. Their rationale relates in particular to the protection of an accused against abusive coercion on the part of the authorities. The language used and the international materials referred to suggest that what the Grand Chamber had in mind here was the need for protection of the accused against abusive coercion while he was in custody. In para 54 it underlined the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of criminal proceedings and referred to the fact that the accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position &#8220;at that stage of the proceedings&#8221; and to the fact that early access to a lawyer was part of the procedural safeguards to which the court will have particular regard. The stage in the proceedings that the court had in mind is not specified other than by reference to the accused&#8217;s vulnerability. This is said to be amplified by the fact that legislation in criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex. It seems that what the Grand Chamber had in mind here was a stage when the accused was being subjected to detailed questioning of the kind that, under the inquisitorial systems, will invariably take place after the accused has been taken into custody. This impression is reinforced by the reference in the third last sentence of the paragraph to the recommendations of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment about the right of a detainee to have access to legal advice as a fundamental safeguard against ill-treatment to which, I would infer, it was thought a detainee might be vulnerable.</p>

The alternative view is that in para 55 it recognised a broader principle that the rule applies as soon as the person has been charged so that article 6 is engaged. This alternative has a certain logical appeal for the reasons that Lord Kerr has identified.

Nevertheless a person can confess if he is willing to do so, and his confession will be admissible if it is truly voluntary. The underlying principle therefore is that there is a right against self-incrimination which in some circumstances must be protected by special measures to protect the person against the risk that a confession may be obtained from him against his will by unfair tactics by the police. That is why the court recognised in its application of those principles to Salduz&#8217;s case, as it had already done in para 54, that an interview which takes place in police custody has particular features which require the provision of an especially strong protection to protect the rights of the defence against a forced confession. It is that aspect of Salduz&#8217;s case which seems to have informed the whole of the court&#8217;s judgment.</p>

The context would have required this to be stated expressly if it was what was intended, as the rule which the judgment laid down can be departed from only where there are compelling reasons to justify its restriction. It would have had to have been stated precisely to what situations outside police custody the rule was to apply, and it was not.</p>

He was informed of his right to silence and exercised it, as he refused to answer the questions put to him by the police. It was held nevertheless that there had been a breach of article 6(3)(c) in conjunction with article 6(1) because he did not have access to a lawyer while he was being interrogated.

In <span style="font-style:italic">Arzu v Turkey</span> (application no 1915/03) (unreported) given on 15 September 2009 the applicant, who was arrested and placed in custody, complained that he had been denied access to a lawyer during the initial stages of the criminal proceedings against him. The court said that <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> had considered the grievance of a lack of access to a lawyer whilst in police custody: para 46. In <span style="font-style:italic">Duman v Turkey</span> (application no 28439/03) (unreported) given on 23 March 2010 the court said in para 46 that the use of statements obtained at the stage of the police inquiry and the judicial investigation is not inconsistent with article 6(1), provided that the rights of the defence are respected. On that point the court said that it relied on the basic principles laid down in its judgments, including <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, para 55, concerning the notion of a fair procedure. In <span style="font-style:italic">Ta&#351;kin v Turkey</span> (application no 5289/06) (unreported) given on 1 February 2011 the applicant complained that he had had no legal assistance before he made his police statement or during his interrogation before the public prosecutor while in custody. The court observed that it had already examined the issue concerning the lack of legal assistance in police custody in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, paras 56-62. In all these cases, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> itself, there was a systemic restriction on access to legal advice by anyone held in police custody in connection with proceedings that were to be taken in the state security courts.</p>

The pattern of the First Section&#8217;s judgment followed that of the Grand Chamber in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>. It repeated many of the propositions in paras 50-55 of <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> in its assessment of the case under the heading &#8220;Restrictions on access to a lawyer in the police custody&#8221;, and referred in para 71 to the fact that the right to silence and the right not to incriminate oneself are generally recognised international standards which lie at the heart of a fair procedure under article 6. But, as it was a custody case, it does not examine the question whether these propositions require access to a lawyer at any earlier stage. In <span style="font-style:italic">Sharkunov and Mezentsev v Russia</span> (application no 75330/01) (unreported) given on 10 June 2010 the question before the court was again directed to the lack of legal assistance while in police custody and the use at the trial of incriminating statements that had been made at that stage. In para 97 the court repeated the proposition that was first stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, para 55 that the rights of the defence will in principle be irretrievably prejudiced when incriminating statements made during police interrogation without access to a lawyer are used for a conviction. But once again the police interrogation in the course of which these statements were made took place while the applicant was in police custody.</p>

Here too the propositions on which the court based its judgment are closely modelled on what the Grand Chamber said in para 55 of <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>. In para 79 it summarised the general principles that are to be found there. It stated that, as a rule, access to a lawyer must be provided as from the first questioning of a suspect by the police, unless it can be demonstrated in the light of the particular circumstances that there are compelling reasons to restrict that right. As in para 55 of <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, no indication is given that the principles are restricted to cases where the accused was in police custody. But, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, that was the background against which the case was heard.

This appears to have been the only case to date in which the complaint was of lack of legal assistance during questioning by the police when the applicant was not in custody. He was stopped while he was driving home from work and his car was inspected by the police as there had been reports of workers stealing diesel from their service vehicles. Two cans of diesel were discovered in the car. The applicant made self-incriminating statements in reply to questions put to him by the police at the roadside. He was charged with stealing the cans, and he was convicted. His complaint was that he had not been advised of the privilege against self-incrimination when he made his admission to the police. His position at the trial was that he had purchased the diesel at a petrol station and that he did not give this explanation to the police because he felt intimidated and did not have a receipt to prove the purchase.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;The right not to incriminate oneself presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused (see, inter alia, <span style="font-style:italic">J B v Switzerland</span>, no 31827/96, para 64, ECHR 2001-III). In this sense the right is closely linked to the presumption of innocence contained in article 6(2) of the Convention. In examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination, the Court must examine the nature and degree of the compulsion, the existence of any relevant safeguards in the procedures and the use to which any material so obtained is put (ibid).&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Applying these propositions to the applicant&#8217;s case, the court noted in para 42 that in criminal matters article 6 comes into play as soon as a person is &#8220;charged&#8221; and that this may occur on a date prior to the case coming before the trial court, such as the date of arrest, the date when the person concerned was officially notified that he would be prosecuted or the date when the preliminary investigations were opened. <span style="font-style:italic">Eckle v Germany</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1982) 5 EHRR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">(1982) 5 EHRR 1</ref>, para 73 was referred to, which includes the proposition taken from cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Deweer v Belgium</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1980) 2 EHRR 439" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1980">(1980) 2 EHRR 439</ref>, para 46 that the test as to whether a person has been &#8220;charged&#8221; for the purposes of article 6(1) is whether the situation of the person has been substantially affected. The court concluded that, given the context of the road check and the applicant&#8217;s inability to produce any proof of the diesel purchase at the moment of his questioning by the police, there was a suspicion of theft against him from that moment and that, although he was not yet accused of any criminal offence, his situation in the proceedings at the roadside was substantially affected. So article 6(1) was engaged at that point.</p>

The court observed in para 47 that the case was different from previous cases concerning the right to legal assistance in pre-trial proceedings. This was because the applicant was not formally arrested or in police custody but was stopped for a roadside check which was carried out in the presence of two attesting witnesses. In para 48 it said:</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">In para 49 it noted that the role of the police in such a situation was to draw up an inspection record and receive the applicant&#8217;s explanation as to the origin of the cans in his car. Having done so, the police transferred the documents to the inquirer who submitted a report to his superior which prompted him to open a criminal case against the applicant. In para 51 it held that the absence of legal representation at the roadside check did not violate his right to legal assistance under article 6(3)(c). In a partly dissenting opinion Judge Spielmann said that the interview took place in circumstances that could in no way be compared to those normally observed during routine road checks and he could not agree that the circumstances of the case disclosed no significant curtailment of the applicant&#8217;s freedom of action such as to require legal assistance. He did not take issue with the principle formulated in para 48. His dissent was as to its application to the facts of the case.</p>

Mr Shead for M submitted that <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko</span> was so out of line with the other cases, and so hard to reconcile with the basic principles that were stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, that it should be regarded as having been wrongly decided. I would reject these arguments. The President of the Court, Judge Rozakis, was a member of the Grand Chamber in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, as was Judge Spielmann. The importance of the question that the case raised, which was whether the ruling in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> applied to questioning where the applicant was not in police custody, would not have been overlooked. The reasoning shows that the reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> was fully taken into account. The finding in para 48 that the circumstances did not disclose a sufficient curtailment of the applicant&#8217;s freedom of action which could be sufficient for activating a requirement for legal assistance indicates that the court was well aware that it had to give reasons for reaching a different result. That it did so in the way that it did shows that this is a judgment which must be taken into account in the search for an answer to the question where the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court stands on the question we have to decide.</p>

He was questioned by the police as a witness in connection with the attempt to detonate four bombs at separate points in the London public transport system two weeks after the bombings that took place on 7 July 2005. He had been approached by two police officers who took him to a police station. According to their evidence at the voir dire at the applicant&#8217;s trial, this was with a view to his assisting the police as a potential witness. They began interviewing him, but after about 45 minutes of questioning they considered that, as a result of the answers that he was giving, he was in danger of incriminating himself and should be cautioned. On instructions from a senior officer they continued nevertheless to interview him as if he were a witness. It was not until after he had completed and signed his witness statement, which contained statements that were incriminating and was made without access to legal assistance, that they were told to arrest him and he was then taken into custody.</p>

But it is at least likely that its judgment will provide some useful guidance as to the approach that is to be taken to a person&#8217;s rights under article 6(1) together with article 6(3)(c) where the prosecution seeks to rely on answers given to questions by the police before he is formally taken into custody. The key issue, so far as the references that are before the court in this case are concerned, is whether, as a rule, access to a lawyer must always be provided when a person is questioned at any stage in the proceedings after he has become a suspect and must be taken to have been charged for the purposes of article 6 (see paras 62-63, below), or whether access to a lawyer is required, as a rule, only where the person has been taken into custody or his freedom of action has been significantly curtailed.</p>

In that case the Supreme Court held that the prosecution may not use statements, whether incriminatory or exculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of a defendant unless it demonstrated the use of procedural safeguards which were sufficient to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. These safeguards require that, unless other fully effective means are devised to inform the accused person of the right to silence and to assure continuous opportunity to exercise it, he must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement that he does make may be used as evidence against him, that he has the right to consult with an attorney and that, if he cannot afford one, a lawyer will be appointed to represent him. &#8220;Custodial interrogation&#8221; for the purposes of this rule means questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way: p 444.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Strasbourg court has not referred to <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span> in any of its judgments, and <span style="font-style:italic">Imbrioscia</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Murray</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Galstyan</span> are the only cases where it has been referred to in a dissenting opinion in the context of what is described in <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span> as custodial interrogation. But it can be assumed that the court will not have overlooked it in its search for generally accepted international human rights standards. The dissenting judgments in <span style="font-style:italic">Imbrioscia</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Murray</span> which drew attention to it were given before the Grand Chamber considered the issue in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, and those cases were cited to it in that case. As T A H M van der Laar and R L de Graaf, &#8220;Salduz and Miranda: is the US Supreme Court pointing the way?&#8221; [2011] 3 EHRLR 304, 315 have pointed out, the test that the Strasbourg court described in paras 47 and 48 of <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko</span> when it considered that the applicant was neither &#8220;formally arrested&#8221; nor &#8220;interrogated in police custody&#8221; and that there was no &#8220;significant curtailment of his freedom of action&#8221; echoes the statement in <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span>, p 477 that the rule of access to a lawyer that it describes applies when the suspect is subjected to police interrogation while in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is not unreasonable to think that <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span> and subsequent cases that the ruling in that case have given rise to in the United States will influence the thinking of the Strasbourg court as it develops the principles described in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>. The significance of <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span> is that it follows the custodial approach to the question as to when access to a lawyer is required. The core of that decision, as der Laar and de Graaf have described it in [2011] EHRLR 304, 310, is that a suspect&#8217;s statement made as a result of interrogation initiated by the interrogating authorities while he is in custody cannot be used in evidence unless the prosecutor can prove that the procedural safeguards that were used were effective enough to secure the suspect&#8217;s right not to incriminate himself. The underlying reason is that the circumstances in which such an interrogation takes place are inherently intimidating. As Chief Justice Warren explained at p 445, an understanding of the nature and setting of the in-custody interrogation was essential to the court&#8217;s decision: incommunicado interrogation in a police-dominated atmosphere. But it was noted that an interpretation of the requirement that the right to legal advice arose at an earlier stage would hamper the traditional function of the police in investigating crime. General on-the-scene questioning as to facts surrounding the crime or other general questioning of citizens was not affected.<span style="font-size:12pt"/>The right to legal advice was held not to extend that far because the compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation was not necessarily present: <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span>, pp 477-478. The accused in that position is protected by the rule that only statements voluntarily made are admissible.</p>

The basis for the ruling in <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span> is that police custody or its equivalent creates particular pressures which mean that the person&#8217;s will is more likely to be overcome when he is being questioned under conditions of that kind. The observation in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, para 53 that the rationale of the generally recognised international human rights standards relates in particular to the protection of the accused against abusive coercion on the part of the authorities fits in with this line of reasoning. This feature is likely to be absent when questions are being put at the locus or in the person&#8217;s home simply with a view to deciding whether the person being questioned is to be treated as a suspect and, as such, to be subjected to further procedures.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I return to the points I made in para 34, above. The privilege against self-incrimination is not an absolute right: <span style="font-style:italic">Murray v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1996) 22 EHRR 29" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">(1996) 22 EHRR 29</ref>, para 47; <span style="font-style:italic">Brown v Stott</span> 2001 SC (PC) 43, 64, per Lord Steyn. At p 60 Lord Bingham said that while it could not be doubted that such a right must be implied, there is no treaty provision which expressly governs the effect or extent of what is to be implied. At p 74 I said that implied rights are open, in principle, to modification or restriction so long as this is not incompatible with the right to a fair trial. We do know however that the right is primarily concerned with respecting the will of the person to remain silent: see <span style="font-style:italic">Saunders v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1996) 23 EHRR 313" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">(1996) 23 EHRR 313</ref>, para 68. A person is therefore free to speak to the police and to answer questions if he is willing to do so, even after he has been cautioned. He can provide them with self-incriminating answers if he is willing to do this, and his answers will be admissible if they are truly voluntary. This approach to the problem is familiar in domestic law: see para 22, above. So long as it is applied the fundamental right under article 6 to a fair trial will be guaranteed. The test is whether the will of the person to remain silent, if that is his will, has been respected. Answers cannot be extracted from him by unfair means, and he must be protected against the risk that they may be forced out of him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is well understood that in some circumstances merely to caution the person that he has the right to remain silent will not be enough to protect him against the risk of a forced confession. The paradigm case is where he is in police custody. In such a situation the circumstances surrounding his questioning are likely to be oppressive and intimidating. The questioning is likely to be prolonged, and the atmosphere is likely to be coercive. In such circumstances it is reasonable to assume that he will be vulnerable to having a confession extracted from him against his will and to insist that special measures are needed to ensure that his rights are respected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As Lord Kerr points out, common experience tells us that a coercive atmosphere can exist independently of custody: para 147, below. That is why it was recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span> and in <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko</span> that a person&#8217;s freedom of action to act as he wishes may be significantly impaired in other circumstances. But it does not follow that this will be so in every case when the police engage in conversation with a suspect. Circumstances will vary, and questioning which may become objectionable as the process continues may not be so during its initial stages. That is why I believe that a more flexible approach to the problem is called for than the rigid principle that Lord Kerr would adopt, which would involve laying down a rule that access to lawyer must always be provided before any police questioning can take place: see para 146, below.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Lord Kerr says in para 148 that there is no reason to suppose that a person questioned by the police while not in detention would not experience the same need to acquiesce in the power of the police to require answers to potentially highly incriminating questions. The important question, he says, is whether the questions asked are liable to be productive of incriminating answers, not the circumstances in which they are being asked. That leads him to say that whenever questions of that kind are being put to a suspect they must be asked in the presence of a lawyer. I do not think that there is any support in the Strasbourg cases, or in such international authorities as we have been shown, for that proposition.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The point that was being made in the Canadian case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Grant</span> 2009 SCC 32; [2009] 2 SCR 353 to which he refers in para 147 was that there are <span style="font-style:italic">situations</span> in which psychological constraint amounting to detention have been recognised: the majority judgment of McLachlin CJ and LeBel, Fish, Abella and Charron JJ at para 30. These are where the subject is legally required to comply with a direction or command and where there is no such obligation but a reasonable person in the subject&#8217;s position would feel so obligated. Not every conversation that takes place between the police and a suspect in which questions are asked is of that character. A demand or direction by a police officer is one thing. Questioning under caution is another. It is understandable that a person who is confronted by a direction or a demand by a police officer to provide information will feel that he has to comply with it. It is understandable too if the circumstances are such that he feels that he has no real choice in the matter. That is why the law requires that before questions are put to him by the police the suspect must be cautioned. In that way a fair balance is struck between the interests of the individual and the public interest in the detection and suppression of crime. The search for that balance is inherent in the whole of the Convention: <span style="font-style:italic">Sporrong and L&#246;nnroth v Sweden</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1982) 5 EHRR 35" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">(1982) 5 EHRR 35</ref>, para 69. The whole point of the caution is to make it clear to the person that he is under no obligation to answer the questions that are being put to him. The requirement would be pointless if it is to be assumed that he will nevertheless feel, whatever the circumstances, that he has no alternative but to answer them. Whether the caution is enough to ensure that the person will have a fair trial will depend on the circumstances.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The correct starting point, when one is considering whether the person&#8217;s Convention rights have been breached, is to identify the moment as from which he was charged for the purposes of article 6(1). The guidance as to when this occurs is well known. The test is whether the situation of the individual was substantially affected: <span style="font-style:italic">Deweer v Belgium</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1980) 2 EHRR 439" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1980">(1980) 2 EHRR 439</ref>, para 46; <span style="font-style:italic">Eckle v Germany</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1982) 5 EHRR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">(1982) 5 EHRR 1</ref>, para 73. His position will have been substantially affected as soon as the suspicion against him is being seriously investigated and the prosecution case compiled: <span style="font-style:italic">Shabelnik v Ukraine</span> (application no 16404/03) (unreported) given on 19 February 2009, para 57. In <span style="font-style:italic">Corigliano v Italy</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1982) 5 EHRR 334" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1982">(1982) 5 EHRR 334</ref>, para 34 the court said that, whilst &#8220;charge&#8221; for the purposes of article 6(1) might in general be defined as the official notification given to the individual by the competent authority of an allegation that he has committed an criminal offence, as it was put in <span style="font-style:italic">Eckle</span>, para 73, it may in some instances take the form of other measures which carry the implication of such an allegation. In <span style="font-style:italic">&#352;ubinski v Slovenia</span> (application no 19611/04) (unreported) given on 18 January 2007, paras 62-63 the court said that a substantive approach, rather than a formal approach, should be adopted. It should look behind the appearances and investigate the realities of the procedure in question. This suggests that the words &#8220;official notification&#8221; should not be taken literally, and that events that happened after the moment when the test is to be taken to have been satisfied may inform the answer to the question whether the position of the individual has been substantially affected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is obvious that the test will have been satisfied when the individual has been detained and taken into custody. It must be taken to have been satisfied too where he is subjected to what <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, para 52 refers to as the initial stages of police interrogation. This is because an initial failure to comply with the provisions of article 6 at that stage may seriously prejudice his right to a fair trial. The moment at which article 6 is engaged when the individual is questioned by the police requires very sensitive handling if protection is to be given to the right not to incriminate oneself. The mere fact that the individual has been cautioned will not carry the necessary implication. But, when the surrounding circumstances or the actions that follow immediately afterwards are taken into account, it may well do so. The moment at which the individual is no longer a potential witness but has become a suspect provides as good a guide as any as to when he should be taken to have been charged for the purposes of article 6(1): <span style="font-style:italic">Shabelnik v Ukraine</span>, para 57. The Lord Advocate submitted that the protection of article 6(3)(c) was not engaged until the individual was actually taken into custody. But this cannot withstand the emphasis that the Strasbourg court puts on the consequences of an initial failure to comply with its provisions, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, para 50; see also <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko v Russia</span>, para 42.</p>

I would attach particular importance to the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko v Russia</span>, for the reasons given in para 46, above. That is not to say that the fact that the individual had no access to legal advice in that situation is of no consequence. If it was practicable for access to legal advice to be offered, this will be one of the circumstances that should be taken into account in the assessment as to whether the accused was deprived of a fair hearing, as he is entitled to respect for the right not to incriminate himself. But it is no more than that. The fact that the incriminating statements were made without access to a lawyer does not of itself mean that the rights of the defence are irretrievably prejudiced, as was held to be the case in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> on account of the lack of legal assistance while the applicant was in custody.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The phrase &#8220;police interrogation&#8221; appears frequently in the cases where the applicant was detained in custody. It was suggested that, for the purposes of the rule about access to a lawyer, it means something more than just asking questions of an individual. These words are, however, extremely fact sensitive. Any questioning of an individual who has been detained in custody by persons who are referred to in the Strasbourg cases as representing the investigating authorities with the aim of extracting admissions on which proceedings could be founded will amount to interrogation for the purposes of the rule: for a statement to that effect in England, see <span style="font-style:italic">R v Absolam</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1989) 88 Cr App R 332" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1989">(1989) 88 Cr App R 332</ref>, 336, per Bingham LJ. The same could be said of questioning that takes place at the roadside or in the person&#8217;s home, depending on the circumstances. It is not necessary, if access to a lawyer is needed for the right to a fair trial to remain practical and effective (see <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, para 55), that the questioning should amount to an &#8220;interrogation&#8221; in the formal sense. It need not be a detailed and sustained course of questioning. Questions that the police need to put simply in order to decide what action to take with respect to the person whom they are interviewing are unlikely to fall into this category. But they are likely to do so when the police have reason to think that they may well elicit an incriminating response from him.</p>

I would answer this question in the negative. Applying the test that I have described in para 62, above, I would hold that Ambrose was charged for the purposes of article 6 when he was cautioned and that the police officer had reason to think that the second and third questions were likely to elicit an incriminating response from him. This conclusion is supported by the way the question whether the applicant was charged was dealt with in <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko v Russia</span>, para 41, where the court said that, given the context of the road check and the applicant&#8217;s inability to produce proof that he had purchased the diesel, there should have been a suspicion of theft against the applicant at the moment of his questioning by the police. The context in Ambrose&#8217;s case was that, when he was approached by the police, he was drunk and sitting in the car. Suspicion that he was committing an offence fell on him as soon as he told the police that the keys were in his pocket.</p>

This leaves open the question whether taking all the circumstances into account it was fair to admit the whole or any part of this evidence. There may, perhaps, still be room for argument on this point. So I would leave the decision as to how that question should be answered to the Appeal Court.</p>

I would hold that M was charged for the purposes of article 6 when he was cautioned by the police officer at his home address. Although he did yet not have enough information as that stage to detain him as a suspect under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46/section/14" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 14</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46" uk:canonical="1995 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1995 Act</ref>, his actions were sufficient to carry the implication that the purpose of his visit was to establish whether M was in that category. Even if that was not so at the moment when M was cautioned, the first question which the police officer put to him carried that implication. I also think that the police officer had reason to think that the second question that he asked (&#8220;Were you involved in the fight?&#8221;) was likely to elicit an incriminating response from him.</p>

The Lord Advocate conceded that G was a suspect from the time of his first admission to possession of a quantity of heroin in his jeans. In must follow that he had been charged for the purposes of article 6 by the time the police began their search. The feature of this case which distinguishes it from the other two is that, although G had not yet been formally arrested and or taken into police custody, there was a significant curtailment of his freedom of action. He was detained and he had been handcuffed. He was, in effect, in police custody from that moment onwards. So I would answer the question in the affirmative. The circumstances were sufficiently coercive for the incriminating answers that he gave to the questions that were put to him without access to legal advice about the items to be found to be inadmissible.</p>

It would be to go further than Strasbourg has gone to hold that a person has, as a rule, a Convention right of access to a lawyer before answering any questions put to him in the course of a police search. It is not because there is a rule to this effect that I would answer the question in the affirmative. Rather it is because it is plain from the particular circumstances of the case that G was, in effect, a detainee when he was being questioned by the police. In the absence of such indications of coercion the question, as in the other cases, will be whether, taking all the circumstances into account, it would be fair to admit the whole or any part of the evidence.</p>

On arrival at the police station the detainee must be advised about his right to free legal advice, including a right to speak to a solicitor on the telephone, and he must be asked if he wishes to do so.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Somewhat to my surprise, my own brief judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder</span> is sought to be prayed in aid in support of the respondents&#8217; contention on these references that the principle against self-incrimination requires a suspect to be given access to legal advice before he is first questioned whatever may be the circumstances of that questioning providing only that article 6(1) is engaged (as indeed it was held to be engaged even in the situation that arose in <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko v Russia</span> (application no 39660/02) (unreported) (judgment given 18 February 2010) &#8211; see paras 41-44 of Lord Hope&#8217;s judgment). With the best will in the world, however, I cannot recognise my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder</span> as offering the least support for any such contention. On the contrary, the whole context of that judgment was interrogation in a police station and in the last sentence I was endeavouring to explain the principal considerations which seem to me to underlie the principle against self-incrimination, namely the importance of guarding against both inadequate police investigation and the exploitation of vulnerable suspects. Strasbourg&#8217;s evident core concern in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> (see in particular para 53 of the Court&#8217;s judgment) is that suspects should be protected against &#8220;abusive coercion&#8221; and that miscarriages of justice should be prevented. Quintessentially such risks arise in the very situation under consideration in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>: the interrogation of a terrorist suspect in police custody. Small wonder that the court (at para 53) saw its decision as &#8220;in line with the generally recognised international human rights standards&#8221;, standards which may be seen from the instruments referred to in the footnotes to relate specifically to rights of access to a lawyer during, rather than before, suspects are taken into police custody.</p>

Section 10(b) provides:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;When faced with an application for exclusion under section 24(2), a court must assess and balance the effect of admitting the evidence on society&#8217;s confidence in the justice system having regard to: (1) the seriousness of the <span style="font-style:italic">Charter</span>-infringing state conduct, (2) the impact of the breach on the <span style="font-style:italic">Charter</span>-protected interests of the accused, and (3) society&#8217;s interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits. At the first stage, the court considers the nature of the police conduct that infringed the <span style="font-style:italic">Charter</span> and led to the discovery of the evidence. The more severe or deliberate the state conduct that led to the <span style="font-style:italic">Charter</span> violation, the greater the need for the courts to dissociate themselves from that conduct, by excluding evidence linked to that conduct, in order to preserve public confidence in and ensure state adherence to the rule of law. The second stage of the inquiry calls for an evaluation of the extent to which the breach actually undermined the interests protected by the infringed right. The more serious the incursion on these interests, the greater the risk that admission of the evidence would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. At the third stage, a court asks whether the truth-seeking function of the criminal trial process would be better served by admission of the evidence or by its exclusion. Factors such as the reliability of the evidence and its importance to the Crown&#8217;s case should be considered at this stage. The weighing process and the balancing of these concerns is a matter for the trial judge in each case. Where the trial judge has considered the proper factors, appellate courts should accord considerable deference to his or her ultimate determination.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">Here, the gun was discovered as a result of the accused&#8217;s statements taken in breach of the <span style="font-style:italic">Charter</span>. When the three-stage inquiry is applied to the facts of this case, a balancing of the factors favours the admission of the derivative evidence. The <span style="font-style:italic">Charter</span>-infringing police conduct was neither deliberate nor egregious and there was no suggestion that the accused was the target of racial profiling or other discriminatory police practices. The officers went too far in detaining the accused and asking him questions, but the point at which an encounter becomes a detention is not always clear and the officers&#8217; mistake in this case was an understandable one. Although the impact of the <span style="font-style:italic">Charter</span> breach on the accused&#8217;s protected interests was significant, it was not at the most serious end of the scale. Finally, the gun was highly reliable evidence and was essential to a determination on the merits. The balancing mandated by section 24(2) is qualitative in nature and therefore not capable of mathematical precision. However, when all these concerns are weighed, the courts below did not err in concluding that the admission of the gun into evidence would not, on balance, bring the administration of justice into disrepute. The significant impact of the breach on the accused&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Charter</span>-protected rights weighs strongly in favour of excluding the gun, while the public interest in the adjudication of the case on its merits weighs strongly in favour of its admission. However, the police officers were operating in circumstances of considerable legal uncertainty, and this tips the balance in favour of admission.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">In short, the position in Canada, just as in England and Wales, is that no absolute rule applies to exclude incriminating evidence obtained in breach of a constitutional right to legal advice &#8211; although it may be supposed that in flagrant cases equivalent to those where the <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder</span> rule itself would apply directly (where a suspect in police custody is denied access to a lawyer during interrogation) the Canadian courts would invariably strike the section 24(2) balance in the accused&#8217;s favour.</p>

It also seems to me inconsistent both with the terms of Judge Bratza&#8217;s concurring opinion in that case (implicit in which was a recognition that under the majority judgment the very earliest time at which a suspect could be found entitled to legal advice is when &#8220;he is taken into police custody or pre-trial detention&#8221;) and with Strasbourg&#8217;s post-<span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> jurisprudence (helpfully analysed by Lord Hope in great detail), most notably the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko v Russia</span> itself.</p>

As Lord Hope observes (at para 53), the significance of <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span> is that it adopts a custodial approach to the question as to when access to a lawyer is required, the fundamental reason being that it is at that point that &#8220;the circumstances in which [the suspect&#8217;s] interrogation takes place are inherently intimidating&#8221;, &#8220;because [of] the compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation&#8221;. As, however, Lord Hope also observes: &#8220;It was noted that an interpretation of the requirement that the right to legal advice arose at an earlier stage would hamper the traditional function of the police in investigating crime&#8221;.</p>

In the intimidating circumstances of custodial interrogation there are undoubtedly some suspects who confess to crimes of which in truth they are innocent. And undoubtedly too, once a suspect has confessed, the police are likely to become less inclined to pursue other useful avenues of investigation that may identify the actual offender. Thus it is that miscarriages of justice can occur. As <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span> suggests, however, the introduction of a right to legal advice (and what, of course, is being contended for here is an <span style="font-style:italic">absolute</span> right to <span style="font-style:italic">free</span> legal advice) at some pre-custodial stage, so far from encouraging proper police investigation into crime, would in fact tend to inhibit it.</p>

This is the critical distinction which <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko v Russia</span> so clearly illustrates. The Court there considered quite separately the applicant&#8217;s article 6 complaints as to (i) legal assistance and (ii) the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to remain silent and in the event it found no violation of article 6 (3)(c) in respect of the former but a violation of article 6(1) in respect of the latter (the applicant&#8217;s self-incriminatory answers to the police&#8217;s roadside questioning having been elicited without his first being cautioned).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In the result I agree with the answers proposed by Lord Hope to the questions posed in the respective references. Essentially it comes to this. In the cases of <span style="font-style:italic">Ambrose</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">M</span> there is no absolute rule such as that laid down in <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder</span> which precludes reliance on the evidence in question. Rather it must be for the trial court to decide &#8211; just as an English court must decide under section 78(1) of PACE &#8211; whether the evidence ought fairly to be admitted or excluded. In G&#8217;s case, however, because he was, as Lord Hope puts it (para 71), &#8220;in effect, in police custody&#8221; from the time when, following his arrest, he was handcuffed and detained, the <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder</span> rule should be held to apply to his questioning during the subsequent search. That said, I also agree with Lord Hope (para 72) that the <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder</span> rule would by no means routinely apply to exclude answers to questions put to a suspect without his having been given the opportunity to seek legal advice during a search. That too would be to go further than Strasbourg has yet gone.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz v Turkey</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2008) 49 EHRR 421" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">(2008) 49 EHRR 421</ref> (applied by this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder v HM Advocate</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2010/43" uk:canonical="[2010] UKSC 43" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] UKSC 43</ref>, [2010] SLT 1125), the ECtHR decided that article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (&#8220;the Convention&#8221;) requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided to a suspect when he is interrogated by the police while he is in detention; and that there will usually be a violation of article 6 if incriminating statements made by a suspect during a police interrogation in such circumstances are relied on to secure a conviction. I shall refer to this as &#8220;the <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> principle&#8221;. The central question that arises in the present proceedings is whether the <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> principle also applies to interrogations of a suspect that are conducted before he is placed in detention. Lord Hope says that there is no sufficiently clear indication in the Strasbourg jurisprudence of how the ECtHR would resolve this question and that we should not apply the <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> principle to situations to which the ECtHR has not clearly stated that it applies.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As Lord Hope explains at paras 26 to 33, the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> was concerned with whether there was or should be a rule that there was a right of access to a lawyer where the person being interrogated was in police custody. On its facts, it was a case about a suspect who had been interrogated by the police while he was in custody. The references in para 53 to &#8220;generally recognised international human rights standards&#8221; (which are concerned with the position of suspects who are in custody) and to &#8220;abusive coercion&#8221; strongly suggest that the court was only considering the position of suspects who are in custody. Paras 37 to 44 contains a discussion of the international law materials relating to a suspect&#8217;s right of access to a lawyer during police custody. Unsurprisingly, the judgment says nothing explicitly about the position of a suspect who is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> in custody. I agree with Lord Hope that the concurring opinions of Judge Bratza and Judge Zagrebelski lend further support to the conclusion that the court was only considering the position of suspects who are in custody.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Lord Kerr says that <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> is authority for the broad proposition that a suspect is entitled to have access to a lawyer at the &#8220;investigation stage&#8221; (because he is in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings) and that there is nothing in the reasoning of the decision to indicate that the investigation stage only begins after the suspect has been detained. But the judgment should be read as a whole. In my view, the better interpretation is that, for the reasons I have already given, the court was only addressing the issue of police interrogation of a suspect in custody. It was making the point that for such a suspect the &#8220;investigation stage&#8221; takes place while he is in custody, where there is the risk of &#8220;abusive coercion&#8221; and he is in a &#8220;particularly vulnerable position&#8221; of making self-incriminating statements.</p>

I agree with the reasons given by Lord Hope at para 46 for rejecting the arguments that <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko</span> was wrongly decided. I note that Lord Kerr does not suggest that it was wrongly decided. He analyses the reasoning of <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko</span> closely at paras 24 to 40. He says that the basis for the court&#8217;s decision that there had not been a violation of article 6(3)(c) is the cumulative effect of a number of factors (which he identifies at para 33) and that none of them, if taken in isolation, would have been sufficient to support the court&#8217;s conclusion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I cannot accept this interpretation of the court&#8217;s reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko</span>. It is true that at para 46, the court &#8220;notes at the outset&#8221; that the applicant waived his right to a lawyer. But the court went on to give other reasons for its decision at para 47. It said that the present case &#8220;is different from previous cases concerning the right to legal assistance in pre-trial proceedings (see <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>.....) <span style="font-style:italic">because the applicant was not formally arrested or interrogated in police custody. He was stopped for a roadcheck</span>....&#8221; (emphasis added). The court was, therefore, fully alive to the difference between police questioning of a suspect at the roadside and police questioning of a suspect who has been taken into custody. It was in the context of this difference that the court made express reference to <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>. Plainly and explicitly it did not apply the <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> principle and it gave its reasons for not doing so. The principal reason was given at para 48 which Lord Kerr has set out at para 160 below. I agree with Lord Kerr that this paragraph is not easy to follow. But what is clear is that the court considered that, whatever restrictions faced the suspect when he was being questioned at the roadside, they did not amount to a &#8220;significant curtailment of [his] freedom of action&#8221; sufficient to entitle him to legal assistance at this early stage of the proceedings. This is an essential part of the court&#8217;s reasoning. It is clear that the court considered that the fact that the questioning took place before the suspect had been formally arrested or detained was critical.</p>

The only case to which our attention has been drawn in which the <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> principle has been considered in relation to statements made by a suspect who is not in detention is <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko</span>. For the reasons that I have given, <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko</span> strongly suggests that the <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> principle does not apply in that situation.</p>

He says that the &#8220;animation of the right under article 6(1) cannot be determined in terms of geography&#8221; (para 133) and that it is arbitrary and illogical to hold that a suspect has no right to access to a lawyer if he is questioned by the police until he is taken into custody: the suspect is as likely to make incriminating statements outside as inside a police station and is therefore in equal need of the protection of article 6(3)(c) in both situations.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The essential question is at what stage of the proceedings access to a lawyer should be provided in order to ensure that the right to a fair trial is sufficiently &#8220;practical and effective&#8221; for the purposes of article 6(1). What fairness requires is, to some extent, a matter of judgment. I accept that opinions may reasonably differ on whether the line for providing a suspect with access to a lawyer should be drawn at the point when the person being questioned becomes a suspect or at the point when he is taken into custody. I do not doubt that being interrogated by the police anywhere can be an intimidating experience and that a person may make incriminating statements to the police wherever the interrogation takes place. This can occur in a situation of what the majority of the Canadian Supreme Court described as &#8220;psychological detention&#8221; in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Grant</span> 2009 SCC 32; [2009] 2 SCR 353, at para 30.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On the other hand, the arresting of a suspect and placing him in custody is a highly significant step in a criminal investigation. The suspect cannot now simply walk away from the interrogator. For most suspects, being questioned after arrest and detention is more intimidating than being questioned in their home or at the roadside. The weight of the power of the police is more keenly felt inside than outside the police station. As was said in <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda v Arizona</span> 384 US 436 (1966) at p 478, there is a &#8220;compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation&#8221;. No doubt, it is also present to the mind of the suspect that the possibility of &#8220;abusive coercion&#8221; is greater inside than outside the police station. Whether the difference between interrogation inside and outside the police station is sufficient to justify according the suspect access to a lawyer in one situation but not the other is a matter on which opinions may differ. But I do not see how it can be said to be arbitrary or illogical to recognise that there is a material difference between the two situations. I can agree with Lord Kerr (para 167) that one should be careful about making assumptions about the <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span> experience or believing that it can be readily transplanted into European jurisprudence. But this counsel of caution is hardly consistent with the assertion that the adoption of the distinction made in <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span> is arbitrary and illogical.</p>

As I have said, to the extent that the ECtHR has spoken on the question at all, <span style="font-style:italic">Zaichenko</span> contains a clear statement that the <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> principle does not apply to statements made by a suspect during police questioning while the suspect (i) is not in custody or (ii) is not deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way. I derive (ii) from para 48. That paragraph echoes the language of p 477 of <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span>: &#8220;The principles announced today deal with the protection which must be given to the privilege against self-incrimination when the individual is first subjected to police interrogation while in custody at the station <span style="font-style:italic">or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way</span>&#8221; (emphasis added).</p>

Nor were there, until the 2010 Act, any provisions similar to those provided in England and Wales under PACE. In <span style="font-style:italic">HM Advocate v Cunningham</span> 1939 JC 61 Lord Moncrieff at page 65 noted that after the accused &#8220;had been charged and had replied, he subsequently received an incidental intimation that he might, if he so desired, require and obtain the assistance of a law agent.&#8221; His Lordship continued:</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">The later full bench decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Chalmers v HM Advocate</span> 1954 JC 66 gave some support for the view that all answers given by a suspect to a police officer were inadmissible and nothing was said about a suspect&#8217;s right to have a solicitor present when he was being questioned. Although that decision was never over-ruled its influence was considered to have been virtually removed by subsequent case law, concerned, it seems, with rising crime rates, which made the criterion of admissibility, fairness - see <span style="font-style:italic">Lord Advocate&#8217;s Reference (No. 1 of 1983)</span>, 1984 JC 52. The decision in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Cadder</span>, in applying the law as set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, can be seen as truly innovative as regards what had been understood to be the domestic law of Scotland up until that time.</p>

The focus of the hearing before this court was concerned, to a significant extent, with how the suspect&#8217;s right to access to a lawyer has been defined to date by the Strasbourg court, either expressly, or by necessary implication, whatever other arguments there may be in principle, or policy, for defining it otherwise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The defence in the cases before us sought to take from the language of the ECtHR, in discussing the right in the decided cases on the topic, a broad approach to its nature and its extent. They had some basis for doing so having regard to how the court expressed itself in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> at para 55 where the Grand Chamber was to the effect &#8220;Article 6(1) requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police&#8221;. At para 52 of the judgment one finds the following &#8220;&#8230;Article 6 will normally require that the accused be allowed to benefit from the assistance of a lawyer already at the initial stages of police interrogation.&#8221; That language, it was submitted, focused on the status of the person as a suspect when determining his rights rather than his position being that of a person in custody. Similar language can be seen in previous judgments of the Court. For example in <span style="font-style:italic">Panovits v Cyprus</span> (Application No 4268/04) (unreported) given 11 December 2008 the Court, at para 66, observed that &#8220;&#8230;the concept of fairness enshrined in Article 6 requires that the accused be given the benefit of the assistance of a lawyer already at the initial stages of police interrogation&#8221; - see also <span style="font-style:italic">Borotyuk v Ukraine</span> (Application No 33579/04) (unreported) given 16 December 2010 at para 79. It should, however, be noted that <span style="font-style:italic">Panovits</span> was a case which concerned the questioning of a child when the child had gone to the police station with his father, as requested by the police, and was thereafter arrested. <span style="font-style:italic">Borotyuk</span> was also a custody case.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;These principles, outlined at para 52 above, are also in line with the generally recognised international human rights standards which are at the core of the concept of a fair trial and whose rationale relates in particular to the protection of the accused against abusive coercion on the part of the authorities. They also contribute to the prevention of miscarriages of justice and the fulfilment of the aims of Article 6, notably equality of arms between the investigating or prosecuting authorities and the accused.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">Those remarks would tend, in my judgement, to support the contention that the focus of the court&#8217;s concern in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, and other cases, has been in relation to those situations where methods of coercion or oppression might be more readily, and effectively, employed upon a suspect person, namely when his liberty has been curtailed by the authority detaining him.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;Today, then, there can be no doubt that the Fifth Amendment privilege is available outside of criminal court proceedings and serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves. We have concluded that without proper safeguards the process of in-custody interrogation of persons suspected or accused of crime contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual&#8217;s will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely. In order to combat these pressures and to permit a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination, the accused must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights and the exercise of those rights must be fully honoured.&#8221;</p>

		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;To summarise, we hold that when an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning the privilege against self-incrimination is jeopardised. Procedural safeguards must be employed to protect the privilege and unless other fully effective means are adopted to notify the person of his right of silence and to assure that the exercise of the right will be scrupulously honoured, the following measures are required. He must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires. Opportunity to exercise these rights must be afforded to him throughout the interrogation. After such warnings have been given, and such opportunity afforded him, the individual may knowingly and intelligently waive these rights and agree to answer questions or make a statement. But unless and until such warnings and waiver are demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Another factor pointing towards the more restrictive extent of the right in question is that the Strasbourg court, in defining it, has done so by referring to the context of what are described as &#8220;pre-trial proceedings&#8221;, see para 50 of the <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> judgment. The person taken into detention who, in due course, may face being tried for a crime, might well be said to be involved, at the stage of any questioning, while detained, to be &#8220;in pre-trial proceedings&#8221; for the purposes of Article 6. That that is the context in which the Strasbourg court has been considering the right in question under Article 6 is, I think, supported by what the court had to say recently in <span style="font-style:italic">Affaire Brusco c France (Requete No 1466/07)</span> (unreported) given 14 October 2010, at para 45:</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">That passage also, to my mind, points to the phrases in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> &#8220;early access to a lawyer&#8221; and &#8220;from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police&#8221; as being references to the earliest point in time after the person is taken into custody with his liberty having been restricted by the investigating authorities. The reference by the Strasbourg court to equality of arms, at para 53 of its judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span>, also, in my opinion, supports that approach. Once a person&#8217;s liberty is curtailed by the authorities, the balance of power between him and the representatives of the state shifts significantly and, it might be said, requires to be redressed by his having access to a lawyer.</p>

It follows that I am in agreement with Lord Hope that the Strasbourg jurisprudence, to date, does not support the defence contention in these references that the ECtHR has gone as far as to say that the right emerges as soon as a suspect is to be questioned by the police in whatever circumstances.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As to whether this court should go further than the ECtHR seems to have gone so far, certain important considerations lead me to the conclusion that it should not. The first is the difficulty that can arise in relation to defining precisely at what point in time someone becomes a suspect, as opposed to being a witness or a detained person. The second is that the broader version of the right, contended for by the defence in these cases, could have serious implications for the proper investigation of crime by the authorities. If the police are to be required to ensure that a person who they wish to question about the commission of a crime (in a situation where the circumstances point to the person being a possible suspect) should have access to a lawyer, if he so wishes, then such a requirement could hamper proper and effective investigations in situations which are often dynamic, fast moving and confused. The unfortunately regular street brawls in city and town centres, or disturbances in crowded places like night clubs, which, on occasions, result in homicide, are simply examples of situations which highlight the problems that might be involved.</p>

That case involved the questioning of a 13 year old. The majority of the court held that the child&#8217;s age was a relevant factor to be taken into account in addressing the question as to whether he had been in custody at the time of questioning. The majority did not depart from the test being whether or not the person was in custody at the relevant time and at page 18 of the opinion of the court they directed the state court to address that question, taking account of all of the relevant circumstances of the interrogation, including the child&#8217;s age at the time. The disagreement between the majority and minority was with regard to the relevance of the child&#8217;s age in judging of the question as to whether or not he was in custody at the relevant time.</p>

Alito J, then, at page 8 of his judgment, under reference to previous authorities remarked that &#8220;a core virtue&#8221; of the Miranda rule has been the clarity and precision of its guidance to &#8220;police and courts&#8221;. Again at page 13 he remarked that &#8220;a core virtue&#8221; of Miranda was the &#8220;ease and clarity of its application&#8221;.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;While the law of Scotland has always very properly regarded fairness to an accused person as being an integral part of the administration of justice, fairness is not a unilateral consideration. Fairness to the public is also a legitimate consideration, and in so far as police officers in the exercise of their duties are prosecuting and protecting the public interest, it is the function of the Court to seek to provide a proper balance to secure that the rights of individuals are properly preserved, while not hamstringing the police in their investigation of crime with a series of academic vetoes which ignore the realities and practicalities of the situation and discount completely the public interest.&#8221;</p>

As was said by Binnie J in the Canadian case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Grant</span> 2009 SCC 32 [2009] 2 SSC 353 at para 180 &#8220;It is not controversial that in the early stages of a criminal investigation the police must be afforded some flexibility before the lawyers get involved.

The law in formulating a right designed to protect and support a legitimate interest, such as the right to silence, should seek to avoid defining that right in such a way, as to damage, or unduly inhibit another legitimate interest such as the efficient investigation of crime. The task, which may be a delicate and difficult one, is to produce a result which strikes a rational balance between the two interests. I consider the balance struck in the US &#8220;Miranda&#8221; jurisprudence achieves that end.</p>

Therefore, said Lord Bingham, although such case law was not strictly binding, where a clear and constant theme of jurisprudence could be detected, it should be followed because the Convention, being an international instrument, had as the authoritative source of its correct interpretation the Strasbourg court.

I believe that, in the absence of a declaration by the European Court of Human Rights as to the validity of a claim to a Convention right, it is not open to courts of this country to adopt an attitude of agnosticism and refrain from recognising such a right simply because Strasbourg has not spoken.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is to be expected, indeed it is to be hoped, that not all debates about the extent of Convention rights will be resolved by Strasbourg. As a matter of practical reality, it is inevitable that many claims to Convention rights will have to be determined by courts at every level in the United Kingdom without the benefit of unequivocal jurisprudence from ECtHR. Moreover, as a matter of elementary principle, it is the court&#8217;s duty to address those issues when they arise, whether or not authoritative guidance from Strasbourg is available. The great advantage of the Human Rights Act is that it gives citizens of this country direct access to the rights which the Convention enshrines through their enforcement by the courts of this country. It is therefore the duty of this and every court not only to ascertain &#8220;where the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court clearly shows that it currently stands&#8221; but to resolve the question of whether a claim to a Convention right is viable or not, even where the jurisprudence of the Strasbourg court does not disclose a clear current view. Finally, section 6 of the Human Rights Act leaves no alternative to courts when called upon to adjudicate on claims made by litigants to a Convention right. This section makes it unlawful for a public authority, including a court, to act in a way which is incompatible with a Convention right. That statutory obligation, to be effective, must carry with it the requirement that the court determine if the Convention right has the effect claimed for, whether or not Strasbourg has pronounced upon it. </p>

If the much vaunted dialogue between national courts and Strasbourg is to mean anything, we should surely not feel inhibited from saying what we believe Strasbourg ought to find in relation to those arguments. Better that than shelter behind the fact that Strasbourg has so far not spoken and use it as a pretext for refusing to give effect to a right that is otherwise undeniable.

The respondents argue that its purpose is that when a person becomes a suspect, because of the significant change in his status that this entails; because of the potential that then arises for him to incriminate himself or to deal with questions in a way that would create disadvantage for him on a subsequent trial; and because of the importance of these considerations in terms of his liability to conviction, the essential protection that professional advice can provide must be available to him.</p>

For reasons that I will develop, I consider that these arguments should prevail. If it has taught us nothing else, recent experience of miscarriage of justice cases has surely alerted us to the potentially decisive importance of evidence about suspects&#8217; reactions to police questioning, whether it is in what they have said or in what they have failed to say, and to the real risk that convictions based on admissions made without the benefit of legal advice may prove, in the final result, to be wholly unsafe.

And it likewise does not matter whether, at the precise moment that a question is posed, the suspect can be said to be technically in the custody of the police or not. If that were so, the answer to a question which proved to be the sole basis for his conviction would be efficacious to secure that result if posed an instant after he was taken into custody but not so an instant before.

When one recognises, as Strasbourg jurisprudence has recognised for quite some time, that the entirety of the trial includes that which has gone before the actual proceedings in court, if what has gone before is going to have a determinative influence on the result of the proceedings, it becomes easy to understand why a lawyer is required at the earlier stage.</p>

The selection of that moment as the first occasion on which legal representation becomes necessary is not only arbitrary, it is illogical. The need to have a lawyer is not to be determined on a geographical or temporal basis but according to the significance of what is taking place when the later to be relied on admissions are made. This much, I believe, is clear from paras 54 and 55 of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz v Turkey</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2008) 49 EHRR 421" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">(2008) 49 EHRR 421</ref>.

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;&#8230; the Court underlines the importance of the investigation stage for the preparation of the criminal proceedings, as the evidence obtained during this stage determines the framework in which the offence charged will be considered at the tria1. At the same time, an accused often finds himself in a particularly vulnerable position at that stage of the proceedings, the effect of which is amplified by the fact that legislation on criminal procedure tends to become increasingly complex, notably with respect to the rules governing the gathering and use of evidence. In most cases, this particular vulnerability can only be properly compensated for by the assistance of a lawyer whose task it is, among other things, to help to ensure respect of the right of an accused not to incriminate himself. This right indeed presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seek to prove their case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression in defiance of the will of the accused. Early access to a lawyer is part of the procedural safeguards to which the Court will have particular regard when examining whether a procedure has extinguished the very essence of the privilege against self-incrimination. In this connection, the Court also notes the recommendations of the CPT [European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment], in which the committee repeatedly stated that the right of a detainee to have access to legal advice is a fundamental safeguard against ill-treatment. Any exception to the enjoyment of this right should be clearly circumscribed and its application strictly limited in time. These principles are particularly called for in the case of serious charges, for it is in the face of the heaviest penalties that respect for the right to a fair trial is to be ensured to the highest possible degree by democratic societies.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The first question that arises from this passage concerns the meaning of &#8220;the investigation stage&#8221;. That stage is stated to be particularly important for two related reasons. The first is that evidence obtained at that stage &#8220;determines the framework&#8221; in which the offence with which the defendant is charged will be considered at trial. In other words, evidence obtained during the investigation stage can significantly influence the outcome of the proceedings and on that account it requires close attention as to its reliability. The second reason is that at that very time (<span style="font-style:italic">viz</span> when evidence capable of influencing the trial&#8217;s outcome is being obtained) the accused finds himself in a vulnerable position. It may seem trite to ask why he should be vulnerable at that time but the answer, it seems to me, is both plain and significant. He is vulnerable <span style="font-style:italic">because</span> at this investigation stage, evidence which may be instrumental in securing a finding of guilt against him is being obtained and collated. The way that he reacts during the collection of that evidence may prove to be of critical importance in his subsequent trial. His vulnerability may be enhanced, moreover, because increasingly complex legislation permits the evidence to be obtained and used in ways that were not previously possible.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I return then to the anterior question. What is meant by the &#8220;investigation stage&#8221;? It must surely include any point or juncture at which evidence which is potentially inculpatory of an accused is being obtained. This is of especial importance when the investigation stage provides the setting for a statement by the accused person that might incriminate him. ECtHR recognised in para 54 of <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> that an incriminating statement might occur at an early stage of the investigation and it was for this reason that early access to a lawyer was considered to be necessary. That early access is expressly required so that the very essence of the right not to incriminate oneself is not destroyed. But extinction of the essence of the right, it seems to me, is precisely what may happen if statements tending to incriminate, made without the benefit of legal advice, are admitted in evidence against their maker on his or her trial. And that conclusion reinforces my view that it is not the place at which admissions are made nor whether the individual making the statements has been detained that is important. What is important is the use to which such statements may subsequently be put.</p>

At O-I2 Judge Bratza said:</p>

		<level>
		  <content>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;At para 55 of the judgment, the Court states as a general principle that in order for the right to a fair trial to remain sufficiently, &#8220;practical and effective&#8221;, article 6 requires that, as a rule, access to a lawyer should be provided, &#8220;as from the first interrogation of a suspect by the police&#8221;. This principle is consistent with the Court&#8217;s earlier case law and is clearly sufficient to enable the Court to reach a finding of a violation of article 6 on the facts of the present case. However, I share the doubts of Judge Zagrebelsky as to whether in appearing to hold that the right of access to a lawyer only arises at the moment of first interrogation, the statement of principle goes far enough. Like Judge Zagrebelsky, I consider that the Court should have used the opportunity to state in clear terms that the fairness of criminal proceedings under article 6 requires that, as a rule, a suspect should be granted access to legal advice from the moment he is taken into police custody or pre-trial detention. It would be regrettable if the impression were to be left by the judgment that no issue could arise under article 6 as long as a suspect was given access to a lawyer at the point when his interrogation began or that article 6 was engaged only where the denial of access affected the fairness of the interrogation of the suspect. The denial of access to a lawyer from the outset of the detention of a suspect which, in a particular case, results in prejudice to the rights of the defence may violate article 6 of the Convention whether or not such prejudice stems from the interrogation of the suspect.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is immediately obvious from this passage that Judge Bratza&#8217;s concern was that the judgment of the court did not go far enough. It is clear that his assumption was that &#8220;the first interrogation of a suspect&#8221; would normally take place <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> he had been taken into custody. He felt that to prescribe that the presence of a lawyer was only then required might not be sufficient. Statements could be made or events could occur which might prove incriminating after the suspect was taken into custody but before the first formal interrogation began. That was why Judge Bratza suggested that a lawyer was required when the accused was taken into custody. But his statement to that effect does not betoken a view that the moment that custody begins should be invested with some special significance. On the contrary, it reflects concern that the suspect&#8217;s vulnerability and his need for a lawyer should not be seen as inevitably coincident with the opening of the formal interview. Statements made or events occurring before that time are just as likely to require the presence of a lawyer if the fairness of the trial is to be assured.</p>

All of the cases concerned suspects who were already in custody when the questioning began. Lord Hope has suggested that importance was attached by Strasbourg in some of these cases to the fact that the person was in custody when he was being interrogated. I do not so read them. It seems to me that the cases are at least as consistent with the view that the important factor in play was that the interrogation was the occasion when inculpatory statements might be made and on that account a lawyer&#8217;s presence was considered an indispensable concomitant of a fair trial.</p>

This, as it seems to me, is entirely consonant with the underlying philosophy of article 6(1) taken in conjunction with article 6(3)(c). The essential question is: when the questioning is taking place, is the suspect in a position where the advice of a lawyer is essential if a fair trial is to occur. If he is liable to incriminate himself at that time, a lawyer&#8217;s presence is required so that he may be fully advised as to how he may or should respond to the interrogation. Likewise, if he requires advice as to how he should react to questioning, for example by giving information that may subsequently emerge at the trial, he needs to have proper guidance. Remaining silent when a perfectly innocent explanation is available may fatally undermine a subsequently proffered defence.</p>

Before such interrogation may be lawfully undertaken, the suspect must be informed of his or her right to legal representation and if he or she wishes to have a lawyer present, questions must be asked of the suspect, whether or not he or she is in custody, in the presence of a lawyer.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Lord Advocate in the present appeal submitted that the touchstone should be the taking into custody of the individual because this marked the start of the coercive atmosphere in which the vulnerability of the suspect was aroused. I cannot accept that argument. Common experience tells us that a coercive atmosphere can exist independently of custody. The subject was also helpfully considered, albeit in a different context, in the Canadian case of <span style="font-style:italic">R v Grant</span> 2009 SCC 32; [2009] 2 SCR 353. In that case the Supreme Court of Canada held that what it described as &#8220;psychological detention&#8221; such as to give rise to rights under section 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was established where an individual has a legal obligation to comply with a restrictive request or demand, or where a reasonable person would conclude by reason of the state conduct that he or she had no choice but to comply. Although the right under section 9 of the Charter is one that entitles an individual not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned, as opposed to the right not to incriminate oneself, the relevance of the decision to the present appeal lies in the court&#8217;s analysis of when the interaction between a police officer and the person he has stopped and questioned assumes a coercive quality. At para 30 of the majority judgment of McLachlin CJ and LeBel, Fish, Abella and Charron JJ it was stated:</p>

		  <intro>
		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;&#8230; we find that psychological constraint amounting to detention has been recognized in two situations. The first is where the subject is legally required to comply with a direction or demand, as in the case of a roadside breath sample. The second is where there is no legal obligation to comply with a restrictive or coercive demand, but a reasonable person in the subject&#8217;s position would feel so obligated. The rationale for this second form of psychological detention was explained by Le Dain J. in [<span style="font-style:italic">R v Therens</span> [1985] 1 SCR 613, 644] as follows:</p>

		  <subparagraph>
		    <content>
		      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in">&#8216;In my opinion, it is not realistic, as a general rule, to regard compliance with a demand or direction by a police officer as truly voluntary, in the sense that the citizen feels that he or she has the choice to obey or not, even where there is in fact a lack of statutory or common law authority for the demand or direction and therefore an absence of criminal liability for failure to comply with it. Most citizens are not aware of the precise legal limits of police authority. Rather than risk the application of physical force or prosecution for wilful obstruction, the reasonable person is likely to err on the side of caution, assume lawful authority and comply with the demand. The element of psychological compulsion, in the form of a reasonable perception of suspension of freedom of choice, is enough to make the restraint of liberty involuntary. Detention may be effected without the application or threat of application of physical restraint if the person concerned submits or acquiesces in the deprivation of liberty and reasonably believes that the choice to do otherwise does not exist.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

In as much, therefore, as a coercive atmosphere is required in order to stimulate the need for the protection that a lawyer&#8217;s presence brings, I consider that it is just as likely that this will occur outside a police station as within. As I have said, the important question is whether the circumstances in which questions are asked are liable to be productive of incriminating answers, not whether those questions are being asked in a police station or whether the suspected person can be said to be in custody.</p>

It is also noted that the inspection record itself indicated Article 178 of the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure as the legal basis for the inspection (see paragraph 26 above). Thus, although the applicant was not accused of any criminal offence on 21 February 2001, the proceedings on that date "substantially affected" his situation.

On that basis the same conclusion (that article 6 is engaged) is irresistible in the three cases involved in these references. In each of the cases it is clear that, at the time that the relevant admissions were made, the police either did have or should have had a suspicion that the persons to whom they were posing questions were guilty of the offences that were under investigation and that the statements made in answer to those questions were or were likely to be highly incriminating of all three.</p>

The Court cannot but note that, as confirmed by the applicant&#8217;s representative in his letter to the European Court dated 26 July 2002, both on 21 February and 2 March 2001 the applicant &#8216;chose not to exercise his right to legal representation with the hope that the court would give him a fair trial even without counsel&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

Observations that appear later in the judgment would tend to support that view, however. In the first instance, the para following (para 47) opens with the word &#8220;moreover&#8221; which suggests that the decision of the applicant not to seek legal representation was, at least, one of a number of reasons for the finding that article 6(3)(c) had not been breached. Secondly, at para 50 of the judgment, the court refers to the applicant&#8217;s election not to seek legal assistance either on 21 February or on 2 March 2001 as a <span style="font-style:italic">waiver</span> of his right to legal assistance.</p>

He was stopped for a road check. This check and the applicant&#8217;s self-incriminating statements were both carried out and made in public in the presence of two attesting witnesses. It is true that the trial record contains a statement by the applicant suggesting that the writing down of the inspection record and/or his subsequent statement were started on the spot but were completed in the village of Birofeld. Nevertheless, the Court concludes on the basis of the materials in the case file that the relevant events, namely the drawing of the inspection record and the taking of the applicant&#8217;s explanation, were carried out in a direct sequence of events.&#8221;</p>

It seems to me impossible to say, on the basis of the statements in this paragraph, that ECtHR has concluded that formal arrest and interrogation in custody are essential prerequisites to the invocation of the right. Rather, it appears that the court treated the cumulative effect of factors that were peculiar to this particular case as the basis for the finding that there had not been a violation of article 6(3)(c). These factors can be enumerated as follows: (1) the applicant had waived his right to a lawyer and had explicitly stated that he did not want a lawyer to represent him despite having been told on 2 March 2001 that he was entitled to legal representation; (2) he had not been formally arrested or interrogated in police custody; (3) the initial questioning of the applicant took place at a road check and not in any formal setting; (4) the applicant was questioned in a public place with other witnesses present who could attest to a lack of coercion on the part of the police; and (5) the checking of the applicant&#8217;s car and his questioning as to the source of the diesel all occurred as part of a seamless process.</p>

The principle which I believe can be said to be common to both is that when a suspect is interrogated by police he is entitled to legal assistance. Where Judge Spielmann parted company with the majority was in its conclusion as to whether the principle applied. Because of the accumulation of factors that the court had identified (see para 158 above) and because it concluded that there had not been a curtailment of Mr Zaichenko&#8217;s freedom of action, it held that the principle did not apply. Judge Spielmann, by contrast, did not attach the weight to the factors that the majority had considered militated against a finding of violation of article 6(3)(c) and he disagreed (in my view, quite properly) with the suggestion that someone who was not free to leave the scene nevertheless had not suffered any curtailment of his freedom of action.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As Lord Hope has said in para 52, &#8220;curtailment of freedom of action&#8221; carries echoes from <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda v Arizona</span> 384 US 436 (1966). And as Lord Hope suggests, it may well be that <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span> will influence the thinking of Strasbourg, it having featured in a number of prominent dissenting judgments in that court already. But I question whether this will lead to the adoption of &#8220;the custodial approach to the question as to when access to a lawyer is required&#8221;. Curtailment of an individual&#8217;s freedom of action can arise even when he has not been taken into custody. The important question must surely be whether the suspect feels constrained to answer the questions posed to him by the police officer. As the <span style="font-style:italic">Grant</span> case illustrates, this can arise either because of the manner in which the police officer manages the exchange with the suspect or because of the latter&#8217;s belief that he has no option but to answer the questions put to him.</p>

The implications of that decision must be considered in the context of police practice in the United States of America. Nothing that has been put before this court establishes that it is common practice in America to ask incriminating questions of persons suspected of a crime other than in custody. Indeed, it is my understanding that as soon as a person is identified as a suspect, police are trained that they should not ask that person any questions until he or she has been given the <span style="font-style:italic">Miranda</span> warnings.</p>

California</span>, 511 US 318 (1994); <span style="font-style:italic">New York v. Quarles</span>, 467 U.S. 649, 655 (1984). So it is clear that the rule that custody is required before entitlement to legal representation arises is not inflexible or static and that its underlying rationale is closely associated with the question whether the person questioned feels under constraint to respond.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">One of the principal practical arguments advanced against the requirement that a suspect be informed that he is entitled to legal representation before incriminating questions are put to him is that this will hamper police investigations. The argument is a venerable one. It has been deployed in reaction to various proposals for safeguards intended to protect suspects&#8217; rights &#8211; including the right to have a solicitor present during interviews and the audio recording or the videotaping of interviews. There is no evidence that the introduction of those measures brought about any widespread impediment to police investigations nor is there, in my view, any convincing evidence that this would be the result of recognising the right of a suspect to be informed that he or she is entitled to legal representation before being required to provide potentially incriminating answers to police questioning.</p>

There is no legal prohibition on police asking questions of a suspect that may produce incriminating answers. The legal consequence of doing so without first informing the suspect of his or her right to be legally represented will be, in my opinion, that the answers produced will be inadmissible in evidence unless compelling reasons such as were discussed in para 55 of <span style="font-style:italic">Salduz</span> exceptionally justify denial of access to a lawyer. One can anticipate, therefore, that police may decide in appropriate circumstances to proceed with questions in order to further the investigation but have to accept that if they are capable of producing incriminating answers from someone who is a suspect, the replies will be inadmissible.</p>

It is my belief that the proper balance to strike for our times is the one that I have suggested in para 146 above.</p>

In these circumstances, I am of the view that he had a right under article 6(3)(c) taken in conjunction with article 6(1) of ECHR to be informed, after his reply to the first question, that he was entitled to legal representation before answering further questions, and that, absent such a warning, the incriminating answers given by him to the second and third questions were not admissible.</p>
