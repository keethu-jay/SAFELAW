	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The ability of asylum seekers who make unsuccessful claims to be allowed to remain to discover further reasons why they should not be removed from the country where they seek refuge is an inescapable feature of any system that is put in place to meet a State&#8217;s obligations under the Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees and article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The opportunity for further reasons to be put forward is enhanced by the fact that a series of decisions may need to be taken before a person&#8217;s immigration status is resolved. Various measures have been put in place by the United Kingdom to deal with this phenomenon. Some of these measures are to be found in the Immigration Rules, and on occasion the meaning that is to be given to them is the subject of controversy: see <span class="case">ZT (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span><span class="case0"/><span class="dtref" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2009/6" uk:canonical="[2009] UKHL 6" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] UKHL 6</ref>, [2009]</span><span class="ref" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> 1 </span><span class="ref0">WLR 348.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In this case however we are concerned with meaning and effect of the statute.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The first respondent BA is a citizen of Nigeria. He is married to a British citizen, by whom he has four children. He entered the United Kingdom in 1988 as a visitor. Initially he was given six months leave to enter. Later he was granted leave to remain as a student until the end of August 1991. He was granted indefinite leave to remain on 25 May 1994 on the basis of his marriage. On 20 May 2005, however, he was served with a decision by the Secretary of State that he was to be deported following his release on licence from a 10 year sentence of imprisonment for conspiracy to import class A drugs. His appeal against this decision to the asylum and immigration tribunal on human rights grounds failed. On 25 May 2007 he was served with a deportation order. On 25 June 2007 and 8 August 2007 further submissions were made on his behalf as to why he should not be deported. The Secretary of State agreed to consider his reasons for seeking revocation of the deportation order, but she declined to revoke it. Directions were then given for him to be removed from this country on 29 December 2007.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The respondent PE is a citizen of Cameroon. He entered the United Kingdom clandestinely in August 2004. On 19 May 2005 he applied for asylum. The Secretary of State refused his application on 5 July 2005. On 9 July 2005 it was decided that directions were to be given for his removal to Cameroon. He did not appeal against this decision. Before it was put into effect however he was sentenced to twelve months imprisonment for having a forged passport and using it to obtain work, to which he had pleaded guilty. As a result of this conviction the Secretary of State decided to make a deportation order against him. He appealed against this decision on asylum and human rights grounds, but his appeal was dismissed. The deportation order was signed, and it was served on him on 10 January 2007. On various dates thereafter his representatives made written representations on his behalf for the decision to be reconsidered. They claimed that he had been and would be persecuted in Cameroon on account of his homosexuality. The Secretary of State declined to reconsider her decision, as in her view his further representations did not amount to a fresh claim within the meaning of rule 353 of the Immigration Rules. He appealed to the tribunal against the Secretary of State&#8217;s refusal to revoke her decision to make the order. The tribunal held that this decision was not an appealable decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 27 December 2007 BA applied for judicial review of the directions for his removal. He contended that he had a further in-country right of appeal. It was no part of his case that his further representations amounted to a fresh claim under rule 353 of the Immigration Rules. PE had already applied for judicial review of the decisions that had been made against him. He claimed that he had a right of appeal against a refusal to revoke the deportation order, that this right was exercisable in-country and that in any event the representations amounted to a fresh claim under rule 353. Permission was given in each case, and the applications were heard together by Blake J: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2008/1140" uk:canonical="[2008] EWHC 1140 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWHC 1140 (Admin)</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 4 All ER 798" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 4 All ER 798</ref>. The judge held that what determined whether there was an in-country right of appeal was whether or not the Secretary of State was satisfied under rule 353 there was a fresh claim: para 62. In his opinion neither claimant had an in-country right of appeal simply by virtue of having made a protection claim or having made fresh representations supported by different material: para 74. In PE&#8217;s case he quashed the decision that his was not a fresh claim and remitted it for redetermination by the Secretary of State. He said that if the Secretary of State were to conclude that the claim is a fresh one but it was still refused, PE would have access to a right of appeal in-country before removal. But if it was not a fresh claim, his right to appeal would have to be exercised from abroad. As Sedley LJ observed in the Court of Appeal, this conclusion raises the same issue as that raised by BA&#8217;s appeal: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/119" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 119" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 119</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 2 WLR 1370" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 2 WLR 1370</ref>, para 4.</p>

The expression &#8220;immigration decision&#8221; is defined in section 82(2). It includes, among other things, a decision that a person is to be removed from the United Kingdom who is here unlawfully, a decision to make a deportation order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41/section/5/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41" uk:canonical="2002 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and a refusal to revoke a deportation order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41/section/5/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 5(2)</ref>: sections 82(2)(g), (j) and (k).

The Secretary of State argued that, once a person had made a claim for asylum, had had that claim refused and had unsuccessfully exercised his rights of appeal under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1993/23/section/9" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 9</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1993/23" uk:canonical="1993 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>, his legal rights were exhausted. There could be no further claim for asylum unless the claimant left the United Kingdom and returned before making a fresh application. At p 781 Sir Thomas Bingham MR rejected that argument. He said that it would undermine the beneficial object of the Convention if the making of an unsuccessful application for asylum were to be treated as modifying the obligation of the United Kingdom or depriving a person of the right to make a fresh &#8220;claim for asylum&#8221;. He then discussed what constituted a fresh claim. At pp 783-784 he said that the acid test must always be whether, comparing the new claim with that which had been rejected, and excluding material on which the claimant could reasonably be expected to rely in the earlier claim, the new claim was sufficiently different from the earlier claim to admit of a realistic prospect that a favourable view could be taken of the new claim despite the unfavourable conclusion reached on the earlier claim.</span></p>

There is obviously a balance to be struck. The immigration appeals system must not be burdened with worthless repeat claims. On the other hand, procedures that are put in place to address this problem must respect the United Kingdom&#8217;s international obligations.

But Mr Husain&#8217;s analysis has persuaded me that the legislative scheme that Parliament has now put in place does not have that effect. Its carefully interlocking provisions, when read as a whole, set out the complete code for dealing with repeat claims. Rule 353, as presently drafted, has no part to play in the legislative scheme. As an expression of the will of Parliament, it must take priority over the rules formulated by the executive. Rule 353A on the other hand remains in place as necessary protection against premature removal until the further submissions have been considered by the Secretary of State.</span></p>

It was not necessary to decide this question in that case, but the Master of the Rolls &#8220;inclined&#8221; to the latter view. This was adopted by the Court of Appeal in later cases: see eg <span style="font-style:italic">WM (DRC) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2006/1495" uk:canonical="[2006] EWCA Civ 1495" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWCA Civ 1495</ref>, [2007] Imm AR 337; <span style="font-style:italic">R (AK) (Sri Lanka) v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2009/447" uk:canonical="[2009] EWCA Civ 447" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWCA Civ 447</ref>. Rule 353 of the Immigration Rules sets out the test which the Secretary of State applies in making his decision. It should not be thought, however, that Miss Laing&#8217;s argument depends upon the existence and wording of rule 353. That merely provides for how the Secretary of State reaches his decision as to whether or not a claim is a &#8220;claim&#8221;. It is not the end of the matter. The Secretary of State&#8217;s test might come under attack for not reflecting the &#8220;acid test&#8221; laid down by the Master of the Rolls in <span style="font-style:italic">Onibiyo</span>.

The conclusion of the Court of Appeal, that this is not a question of precedent fact, to be determined by the appellate authorities and ultimately by the courts, might be challenged in the Supreme Court.

She is not relying on rule 353 to construe <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41" uk:canonical="2002 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref>.</p>

I would make it clear, however, that this is not a conclusion at which I readily arrived and I reached it only on the basis that, as Mr Husain in his enticing submissions readily accepted, the statutory solution to the problem of abuse created by the making of repeat asylum claims lies not in construing &#8220;an asylum claim&#8221; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41/section/92/4" uk:canonical="2002 c. 41 s. 92" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 92(4)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41" uk:canonical="2002 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002</ref> as the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Onibiyo</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] QB 768" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] QB 768</ref> construed &#8220;a claim for asylum&#8221; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1993/23/section/6" uk:canonical="1993 c. 23 s. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1993/23" uk:canonical="1993 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993</ref> but rather in the Secretary of State issuing certificates where appropriate under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41/section/94" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 94</ref> or 96 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41" uk:canonical="2002 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2002 Act</ref> (no equivalent provisions having been available under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1993/23" uk:canonical="1993 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1993 Act</ref>).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">True it is, as observed by Lord Hope in paragraph 29 of his judgment (and noted also at paragraph 13 of Sedley LJ&#8217;s judgment in the Court of Appeal <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 2 WLR 1370" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 2 WLR 1370</ref>), that it is common ground between the parties that the present cases are not certifiable under either of these sections. That, however, as I understand it, is solely because, so far as <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41/section/94" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 94</ref> is concerned, it applies only &#8220;where the appellant has made an asylum claim or a human rights claim (or both)&#8221; (sub<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1993/23/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref>). By the same token that, on the Secretary of State&#8217;s argument, a repeat claim does not fall within those words in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41/section/92/4" uk:canonical="2002 c. 41 s. 92" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 92 (4)</ref>(a), so he contends that it does not do so for <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41/section/94" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 94</ref> purposes. Given, however, as Mr Husain submits and I would accept, that a repeat claim <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> involve making a claim for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41/section/92/4" uk:canonical="2002 c. 41 s. 92" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 92(4)</ref>(a), so too it enables the Secretary of State to certify it as &#8220;clearly unfounded&#8221; if he so regards it under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2002/41/section/94" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 94</ref>. Moreover, consistently with what the House said in <span style="font-style:italic">ZT (Kosovo) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 1 WLR 348" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 1 WLR 348</ref> (Lord Neuberger&#8217;s views expressed at paragraphs 80-81 of his opinion being determinative on this point), there will be precious few cases in which that test differs from the rule 353 test as to whether a claim has &#8220;a realistic prospect of success&#8221;.</p>
