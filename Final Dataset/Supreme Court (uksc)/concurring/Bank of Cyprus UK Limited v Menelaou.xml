	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">This appeal is concerned with the law of unjust enrichment and subrogation. The original parties to the action were Melissa Menelaou as claimant (&#8220;Melissa&#8221;), the Bank of Cyprus UK Ltd as defendant (&#8220;the Bank&#8221;) and a firm of solicitors, Boulter &amp; Co, as third party (&#8220;Boulters&#8221;). The trial of the action came before David Donaldson QC, sitting as an additional judge of the Chancery Division (&#8220;the judge&#8221;): <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2012/1991" uk:canonical="[2012] EWHC 1991 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWHC 1991 (Ch)</ref>. The trial began on 16 May 2012 and lasted three days. By the end of the trial only the Bank&#8217;s counterclaim against Melissa was live. On 19 July 2012 the judge handed down a judgment dismissing the counterclaim. The Bank appealed to the Court of Appeal (Moses, Tomlinson and Floyd LJJ), which allowed the appeal on 4 July 2013: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1960" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1960" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1960</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 WLR 854" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 WLR 854</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The facts can largely be taken from the agreed statement of facts and issues. Melissa, who was born on 27 January 1990, is the second of the four children of Mr Parris and Mrs Donna Menelaou (&#8220;the Menelaou parents&#8221;). The other children were Danielle, born on 9 August 1986, Max, born on 24 June 1991 and Ella-Mae, born on 6 February 2002. In mid-2008, the Menelaou parents and their three youngest children lived at Rush Green Hall, Great Amwell, Hertfordshire (&#8220;Rush Green Hall&#8221;), which was a property owned by the Menelaou parents jointly. Melissa was 18 and a student at a nearby college. Rush Green Hall was subject to two charges in favour of the Bank. The Menelaou parents directly owed the Bank about &#163;2.2m, and had personally guaranteed loans made by the Bank to their companies.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Menelaou parents decided to sell Rush Green Hall, to apply some of the proceeds to buy a smaller property as the family home, to provide funds for Danielle to pay the deposit on a house which she wanted to buy with her future husband and to free up capital to invest in a further development project. The Menelaou parents instructed Boulters to act for them in the conveyancing transaction. The senior partner of Boulters was Mr Menelaou&#8217;s sister. They used Mr Paul Cacciatore, who was employed by Boulters as a legal executive and who was also one of Mr Menelaou&#8217;s brothers-in-law. On 15 July 2008 contracts were exchanged for the sale of Rush Green Hall for the price of &#163;1.9m. The contractual purchasers of Rush Green Hall paid a deposit of &#163;190,000 to Boulters for the account of the Menelaou parents.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">About a week later, Mr Menelaou informed Mr Cacciatore that he had found a new property to serve as the family home at 2 Great Oak Court, Hunsdon, Hertfordshire (&#8220;Great Oak Court&#8221;). On 24 July 2008 contracts were exchanged for the purchase of Great Oak Court for the price of &#163;875,000. On Mr Menelaou&#8217;s instructions, the purchaser of Great Oak Court was to be Melissa. The deposit payable was &#163;87,500. This deposit was paid from the &#163;190,000 held by Boulters as the deposit for the sale of Rush Green Hall. Mr Menelaou told Melissa that Great Oak Court was being bought in her name as a gift to her, on the basis that she would hold the property for the benefit of herself and her two younger siblings. She agreed to the arrangement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Bank was not approached about the proposed arrangement prior to the exchanges of contracts. The Bank sanctioned the proposed arrangements with some reluctance given the overall indebtedness of the Menelaou parents and their companies. On 5 September 2008 Boulters wrote to the Bank saying that it understood that the Bank was to take a charge over Great Oak Court from Melissa, which Boulters understood would be a third party charge. Completion was to be on 12 September. On 9 September 2008 the Bank wrote to Boulters in these terms:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Bank also instructed Boulters to act as its solicitors to deal with the discharge of its charges over Rush Green Hall and to obtain a charge in favour of the Bank over Great Oak Court. On 10 September 2008 Boulters replied to the Bank&#8217;s letter of 9 September enclosing a certificate of title undertaking to obtain an executed mortgage in Melissa&#8217;s name over Great Oak Court and to confirm that they had complied or would comply with the Bank&#8217;s instructions. On 11 September 2008 Boulters sent the Bank a form of legal charge over Great Oak Court, purportedly signed by Melissa and identifying her as &#8220;the customer&#8221;. It was (and is) Melissa&#8217;s case, supported by her brother and by handwriting evidence, that the signature on the charge was not hers. Indeed, she was unaware of the existence of the charge until 2010. On the same day, 11 September 2008, the Bank telephoned Boulters and pointed out that the identity of the customer in the charge should be the Menelaou parents and not Melissa. Boulters did not contact Melissa. Instead, an employee of Boulters simply changed the name of the customer in manuscript on the charge from that of Melissa to those of the Menelaou parents.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">On 12 September 2008 completion of the sale of Rush Green Hall by the Menelaou parents and the purchase of Great Oak Court by Melissa both took place. As part of the completion process, Boulters received the balance of the price of Rush Green Hall from its purchasers. They remitted &#163;750,000 to the Bank and sent a further &#163;785,000 to the vendors of Great Oak Court to meet the remaining 90% of the purchase price for Great Oak Court. Boulters also sent the Bank two deeds to be sealed by the Bank authorising the cancellation of the entries in respect of the two registered charges over Rush Green Hall. The discharge of mortgage forms were not returned by the Bank until 13 October 2008. After a considerable delay, Melissa was registered as the proprietor of Great Oak Court. The Bank was also registered as the purported chargee. Following completion, the Menelaou parents, Melissa, and her two younger siblings moved into Great Oak Court and occupied it as their family home.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In the spring of 2010 Melissa was told by her parents that their business was experiencing difficulties. It was proposed that Great Oak Court would be sold and a smaller property purchased. It was at this point that Melissa discovered the existence of the charge dated 12 September 2008 over Great Oak Court. Melissa&#8217;s conveyancing solicitors then corresponded with Boulters. The Bank was made aware of the challenge to the validity of its charge and, through its solicitors, intimated a claim against Boulters. Many allegations of breach of duty (fiduciary and otherwise) were made by the Bank against Boulters.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">On 2 November 2010 Melissa issued a Part 7 claim in the Chancery Division seeking orders that all references to the charge, as appearing in the Charges Register for Great Oak Court, be removed. The main basis for this claim was that, not having been signed by Melissa, the Bank&#8217;s charge was void. The Bank defended the claim but also counterclaimed for a declaration that the Bank was entitled to be subrogated to an unpaid vendor&#8217;s lien over Great Oak Court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">On 14 January 2011 the Bank issued a Part 20 claim against Boulters for damages for breach of trust and/or fiduciary duty, and an indemnity against all costs and expenses that it might incur in the main claim. After the exchange of witness statements, it became clear to Melissa and her advisers that Boulters had altered the charge without consulting her. By consent of the parties, pursuant to Melissa&#8217;s application dated 13 April 2012, the particulars of claim were amended to rely upon this alteration as a further ground for rendering the charge void. The Bank&#8217;s response was to continue to challenge the invalidity of the charge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">As stated above, the trial of the case began on 16 May 2012. At the commencement of the trial all issues were live. Melissa was called to give evidence and was duly cross-examined. Thereafter, following an interchange between counsel and the judge, Boulters conceded in the Part 20 claim that the charge was void and that Melissa was entitled to the relief sought in her claim and, as it is put in the statement of facts and issues, reflexively, the Bank conceded the same in the main claim. The issue of liability in the Bank&#8217;s claims against Boulters was then compromised and a written agreement was entered into between the Bank and Boulters whereby Boulters accepted that it was in breach of its duties in both contract and tort and was liable to indemnify the Bank for its losses as a result of an invalid charge being entered against Great Oak Court. As a result of that agreement, the only remaining live issue for determination at the trial was the Bank&#8217;s counterclaim against Melissa.</p>

As to the wider approach,<span style="font-style:italic"/>he concluded that there was both benefit to Melissa, namely the gratuitous acquisition of Great Oak Court (albeit to be held on trust for her two younger siblings), and detriment to the Bank, namely the release of its two charges (para 22).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In my opinion the answer to the question whether Melissa was unjustly enriched at the expense of the Bank is plainly yes. The Bank was central to the scheme from start to finish. It had two charges on Rush Green Hall which secured indebtedness of about &#163;2.2m. It agreed to release &#163;785,000 for the purchase of Great Oak Court in return for a charge on Great Oak Court. It was thus thanks to the Bank that Melissa became owner of Great Oak Court, but only subject to the charge. Unfortunately the charge was void for the reasons set out above. In the result Melissa became the owner of Great Oak Court unencumbered by the charge. She was therefore enriched at the expense of the Bank because the value of the property to Melissa was considerably greater than it would have been but for the avoidance of the charge and the Bank was left without the security which was central to the whole arrangement.</p>

It is submitted on behalf of the Bank that, if that is so, it would be pure formalism for subrogation to be precluded simply because the moneys remained in Boulters&#8217; client account (and were not paid to the respondent) between the sale of Rush Green Hall and the purchase of Great Oak Court; just as Lord Steyn commented in <span style="font-style:italic">Banque Financi&#232;re </span>at p 227C that it would be &#8220;pure formalism&#8221; for the interposition of Mr Herzig between the loan by BFC of its advance and Parc&#8217;s obligation to repay to be treated as altering the substance of the transaction and the result of the claim. On the facts of the instant case the funds remained in Boulters&#8217; client account and were not paid to the Bank because of a pre-acquisition agreement between it and the Menelaou parents. By this agreement it was agreed that money to which the Bank was otherwise absolutely entitled under its charges could remain advanced to the Menelaou parents for the purpose of purchasing Great Oak Court and was to be released only on condition that the Bank was given a specific charge over Great Oak Court.</p>

The question in each case is whether there is a sufficient causal connection, in the sense of a sufficient nexus or link, between the loss to the Bank and the benefit received by the defendant, here Melissa.</p>

However, it appears to me that, whichever test is adopted the result is likely to be the same. In any event it is not to my mind necessary to consider the issue further in this case because, as the Court of Appeal made clear, the position is clear on the facts of the instant case, which is concerned only with the first of Henderson J&#8217;s relevant considerations. In a case in which more such considerations were relevant, it would be necessary to have regard to a number of different factors, probably with no presumption one way or the other where the starting point is.</p>

The Bank had agreed that it would release its charges over Rush Green Hall upon receipt of &#163;750,000 out of the sale proceeds, in return for a charge over Great Oak Court to secure what would be the remaining indebtedness, &#163;1.45m, thereby enabling the Menelaou parents on the strength of that undertaking by the Bank to use &#163;875,000 out of the sale proceeds of Rush Green Hall for the purchase of Great Oak Court in the name of Melissa. I do not see how this can sensibly be described as anything other than a transfer of value between the Bank and Melissa, in whose name the purchase of Great Oak Court was made.</p>

It is not suggested, for example, that she had a change of position defence. Nor was she a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. She was a mere donee and, as such can be in no better position than her parents as donors. As indicated at the end of para 31 above, I recognise that in another case there may well be defences or at least countervailing considerations, as indicated, for example, in considerations (b), (c) and (d) identified by Henderson J.</p>

What the Bank seeks to achieve is to be placed in a position equivalent to that of the vendor of Great Oak Court at the point where the purchase money has not been paid. At that point the vendor would be able to refuse to convey the title to Great Oak Court, unless the purchase money was paid to him.

This is so even after the lien has been extinguished as between vendor and purchaser. Floyd LJ notes that it is not intuitively clear how, or why, this should be the case and asks how it is that the unpaid vendor&#8217;s lien transferred from the vendor to the third party. He says with force that it might be thought that once the obligation in question has been extinguished, there is nothing which the vendor could transfer. He further asks by what legal method the transfer takes place, even if there was something to transfer. He notes that there has been no legal assignment and suggests that it was conceptual problems such as these that gave rise to the notion that the vendor&#8217;s lien was &#8220;kept alive&#8221; for the benefit of the subrogated third party.</p>

Such an analysis has inevitably to be propped up by presumptions which can verge upon outright fictions, more appropriate to a less developed legal system than we now have. I would venture to suggest that the reason why intention has played so prominent a part in the earlier cases is because of the influence of cases on contractual subrogation. But I think it should be recognised that one is here concerned with a restitutionary remedy and that the appropriate questions are therefore, first, whether the defendant would be enriched at the plaintiff&#8217;s expense; secondly, whether such enrichment would be unjust; and thirdly, whether there are nevertheless reasons of policy for denying a remedy.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;My Lords, there is no general doctrine of unjust enrichment recognised in English law. What it does is to provide specific remedies in particular cases of what might be classified as unjust enrichment in a legal system that is based upon the civil law. There are some circumstances in which the remedy takes the form of &#8216;subrogation&#8217;, but this expression embraces more than a single concept in English law. It is a convenient way of describing a transfer of rights from one person to another, without assignment or assent of the person from whom the rights are transferred and which takes place by operation of law in a whole variety of widely different circumstances. Some rights by subrogation are contractual in their origin, as in the case of contracts of insurance. Others, such as the right of an innocent lender to recover from a company moneys borrowed ultra vires to the extent that these have been expended on discharging the company&#8217;s lawful debts, are in no way based on contract and appear to defeat classification except as an empirical remedy to prevent a particular kind of unjust enrichment.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Those statements seem to me to support a flexible approach to the remedies appropriate in a particular case. Indeed, the principles have been extended since the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Orakpo </span>because there is now a general doctrine of unjust enrichment in a way that there was not when Lord Diplock drafted his speech. Lord Hoffmann stresses the importance of the questions identified in para 18 above. It appears to me that, on the facts of this case, if, as here, the first three questions are answered in the affirmative and the fourth in the negative, the appropriate equitable remedy is that the claimant is subrogated to the unpaid vendor&#8217;s lien as explained in paras 41 and 42 above. On the facts here the Bank is entitled to a lien on the property, which is in principle an equitable interest which it can enforced by sale. In short, by effectively reinstating Melissa&#8217;s liability under the charge, the remedy of subrogation is reversing what would otherwise be her unjust enrichment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I would accept the submission made on behalf of the Bank that the analyses in <span style="font-style:italic">Banque Financi&#232;re</span> have rationalised the older cases through the prism of unjust enrichment. <span style="font-style:italic">Banque Financi&#232;re</span> was not limited to subrogation to personal rights. The remedy the House fashioned was subrogation to a property right but, as the Bank puts it, it was attenuated so as not to grant RTB a greater right than that for which it had bargained. There is no reason why, on the facts of this case, the remedy should not be subrogation as described above, even if the Bank did not retain a property interest in the proceeds of sale of Rush Green Hall. The remedy simply reverses the unjust enrichment which Melissa would otherwise enjoy by ensuring that the Bank not only has a personal claim against her but also has an equitable interest in Great Oak Court, as it would have had if the scheme had gone through in accordance with the agreement of the Bank and the Menelaou parents. Moreover, but for the proposed remedy the Bank would lose the benefit it was to receive from the scheme, namely a charge on Great Oak Court to replace the charges it had on Rush Green Hall.</p>

In any event I agree with him that it is not necessary to decide this question in this appeal for reasons he gives in para 82. I would only say that there seems to me to be considerable force in his comments in para 81, namely that the standard response to unjust enrichment is a monetary restitutionary award in order to reverse the unjust enrichment.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Bank&#8217;s primary case involves two steps; the first is that it has a claim based on unjust enrichment against Melissa; the second step is that that claim was or should be satisfied by subrogating the Bank to the Lien. Melissa&#8217;s main argument against the first step is that she was innocent of any wrong-doing and therefore cannot be said to have been unjustly enriched. As to the second step, her main argument is that subrogation as claimed by the Bank is not, as a matter of principle, available as a remedy for unjust enrichment in the circumstances of this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The first step in the Bank&#8217;s case is that it has a claim against Melissa in unjust enrichment. A claim in unjust enrichment requires one to address the four questions which Lord Clarke sets out in para 18 above. I agree with what he says in relation to those four questions in this case in paras 19-35 above, and indeed with the analysis of Floyd LJ in the Court of Appeal at <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/1960" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 1960" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 1960</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2014] 1 WLR 854" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] 1 WLR 854</ref>, paras 29 to 42.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The answer to the first question, namely whether Melissa has been enriched, would appear to be plainly yes, because she received the freehold of Great Oak Court (&#8220;the freehold&#8221;) for nothing. However, although it does not affect the outcome in the present case, there is much to be said for the view that the relevant enrichment for present purposes is that she received the freehold free of any charge, instead of receiving it subject to a charge to secure her parents&#8217; indebtedness to the Bank (a &#8220;Charge&#8221;).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">This may be a more accurate way of answering the first question for present purposes, because the only aspect of Melissa&#8217;s enrichment which can be complained of by anyone arises from the fact that she received the freehold free of the intended Charge. The fact that the freehold was conveyed to her was an uncontroversial benefit, but the fact that it was not subject to a Charge was not just a benefit, but, in the light of the facts surrounding the sale of Rush Green Hall, the purchase of Great Oak Court and the preparation of the defective Deed of Charge (&#8220;the Deed&#8221;), it was accidental and unintended. (The fact that Melissa held the freehold on trust for herself and her siblings adds nothing for present purposes.)</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In any event, it might be said to be somewhat artificial to distinguish between acquisition of the freehold and acquisition of the freehold subject to the Charge. After all, Great Oak Court could not have been acquired without the Bank&#8217;s agreement that some of the proceeds of sale of Rush Green Hall could be used to purchase it, and that agreement was conditional on the grant of the Charge contemporaneously with the purchase. This is reflected by the observations of Lord Oliver in <span style="font-style:italic">Abbey National Building Society v Cann</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 1 AC 56" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 1 AC 56</ref>, 92-93, albeit that his observations apply by analogy rather than directly:</p>

The acquisition of the legal estate is entirely dependent upon the provision of funds which will have been provided before the conveyance can take effect and which are provided only against an agreement that the estate will be charged to secure them. &#8230; The reality is that the purchaser of land who relies upon a building society or bank loan for the completion of his purchase never in fact acquires anything but an equity of redemption, for the land is, from the very inception, charged with the amount of the loan without which it could never have been transferred at all and it was never intended that it should be otherwise.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Bank had the right to demand the whole of the proceeds of sale of Rush Green Hall, as the Menelaou parents&#8217; debt to the Bank, which had been secured on the freehold of Rush Green Hall, exceeded the proceeds of sale. Instead, the Bank agreed that &#163;875,000 of those proceeds of sale could be used to fund the purchase of the freehold of Great Oak Court, but only provided that the Bank was granted a Charge over that freehold at the time of its acquisition. So the Bank would have had the right to prevent the &#163;875,000 being used to purchase the freehold if it had not been provided with a valid Charge. Even assuming (as Melissa asserts) that the Bank had released to the Menelaou parents &#163;875,000 of the proceeds of sale of Rush Green Hall, the release was only on the basis that it would be granted a Charge over Great Oak Court. Therefore, it seems to me clear that the Bank could have prevented the purchase proceeding until it had been granted a Charge. Accordingly, again deriving support from the passage quoted from <span style="font-style:italic">Abbey National</span>, looking at the arrangements in relation to the purchase and charging of Great Oak Court, it seems to me plain that Melissa&#8217;s enrichment was at the expense of the Bank.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">That conclusion is reinforced (if reinforcement is needed) by the point made by Lord Clarke in para 25 above, reflecting the realistic approach of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Abbey National</span>, that it is appropriate not merely to consider the purchase of, and charge over, Great Oak Court as a single composite transaction. It is also appropriate in the present case to treat the sale of Rush Green Hall and the purchase of Great Oak Court as one scheme, at least for present purposes. I see nothing in any of the judgments in <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Southern Pacific Mortgages Ltd </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2014/52" uk:canonical="[2014] UKSC 52" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] UKSC 52</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] 1 AC 385" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] 1 AC 385</ref> (<span style="font-style:italic">sub nom Mortgage Business plc v O&#8217;Shaughnessy</span>) which casts doubt on that approach.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">If one regards the enrichment as having the freehold uncharged rather than subject to a Charge, it therefore seems clear that that enrichment was at the Bank&#8217;s expense. One gets the same answer if Melissa&#8217;s enrichment is regarded as being the freehold in its entirety: that enrichment would be at the expense of the Bank, albeit only to the extent that the freehold was uncharged rather than subject to the Charge, and therefore the points made in paras 66-67 above would apply with equal force.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The third question is whether the enrichment was unjust. At first sight, there may appear to be some attraction in Melissa&#8217;s argument that, as between the Bank and herself, her enrichment was not unjust. After all, as Mr Mark Warwick QC pointed out, she owed the Bank nothing, she was wholly unaware of a prospective or actual charge, and she was innocent of any oversight, let alone any wrong-doing, whether before, during or after the sale of Rush Green Hall and the purchase of Great Oak Court.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The answer to that contention, in my view, lies in the fact that Melissa received the freehold as a gift from her parents. Had she been a <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide </span>purchaser for full value, it may very well have been impossible to characterise her enrichment as unjust, especially if she had no notice of the Bank&#8217;s rights. If she had paid a small sum to her parents for her acquisition, a difficult question might have had to be faced, although, as at present advised, I think that her enrichment would still have been unjust, but the extent of any unjust enrichment would be reduced by the small sum. But she paid nothing, and she therefore cannot, in my view, be in any better position than her parents so far as the Bank&#8217;s claim is concerned. And there can be no doubt that, if the Menelaou parents, rather than directing the transfer to Melissa, had acquired the freehold themselves in circumstances where the Deed was for some reason invalid, the Bank would have had a claim against them in unjust enrichment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Again, it seems to me to be easier to see why Melissa&#8217;s enrichment should be characterised as unjust if her enrichment is treated as being the receipt of the freehold uncharged instead of subject to the Charge. Her parents were quite properly able to direct the transfer of the freehold of Great Oak Court to Melissa, but they were not properly entitled, so far as the Bank was concerned, to direct the transfer to her of the unencumbered freehold; they were only properly able, at least as against the Bank, to direct the transfer to her of the freehold subject to a Charge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">A variant of Mr Warwick&#8217;s argument on this third aspect is the contention that, if the Bank could otherwise mount a valid unjust enrichment claim, that claim cannot succeed against Melissa, as she was only an &#8220;indirect recipient&#8221; of any enrichment, to use the language Goff &amp; Jones<span style="font-style:italic"/>on <span style="font-style:italic">The Law of Unjust Enrichment</span>,<span style="font-style:italic"/>8th ed (2012), eds Professors C Mitchell, P Mitchell and Watterson, paras 6-12ff and in Ben McFarlane&#8217;s article <span style="font-style:italic">Unjust Enrichment, Property Rights, and Indirect Recipients </span>(2009) 17 RLR 37. It is fair to say that there was a tripartite relationship in this case, in the sense that not merely Melissa and the Bank, but also the Menelaou parents, were parties to the arrangements which gave rise to the alleged unjust enrichment. However, as already explained above, there was in reality a single transaction, and it was from that transaction that Melissa directly benefitted, even though the benefit was effected at the direction of the Menelaou parents. The benefit to Melissa was direct because it arose as the immediate and inevitable result of the very transaction to which she was party and which gave rise to the unjust enrichment (in contrast to the examples at the beginning of Professor McFarlane&#8217;s article). I should add that, even if Melissa could be characterised as an indirect recipient of any enrichment, I do not consider that that would assist her: she would still properly be liable on the facts of this case, essentially for the same reasons.</p>

However, it does render it more likely that she would be able to rely on subsequent events to give rise to an innocent change of position defence to a claim based on the unjust enrichment. However, no such defence appears to arise in this case.</p>

There is nothing in that point. Boulters&#8217; liability in no way impinges on the question whether, and to what extent, Melissa was unjustly enriched at the expense of the Bank: the Bank&#8217;s claim against Boulters is <span style="font-style:italic">res inter alios acta </span>so far as Melissa is concerned. (Further, although the point was not argued, it may well be that, if the Bank had recovered damages from Boulters, then Boulters would be subrogated to the Bank&#8217;s unjust enrichment claim against Melissa.)</p>

(And in that connection, the fact that 10% of the &#163;875,000 had already been paid as a deposit is irrelevant for present purposes, as the balance had to be paid to &#8220;rescue&#8221; the deposit.)</p>

It would give the Bank a lien instead of a formal charge, and it would be in the sum of &#163;875,000 (plus interest), rather than the larger debt, well over &#163;1m at the time of the purchase of the freehold, owed by the Menelaou parents to the Bank.</p>

Further, as Mr Rainey QC, for the Bank, pointed out in his clear argument, no consideration was given in those cases to analysing whether actual ownership of the money on the part of the person claiming subrogation was needed. Nonetheless, that does not alter the point that subrogation should be accorded to the Bank in this case only if it can be achieved in accordance with principle.</p>

At p 231G-H, having described subrogation in the traditional case as &#8220;a contractual arrangement for the transfer of rights against third parties [which] is founded upon the common intention of the parties&#8221;, he went on to say that &#8220;the term is also used to describe an equitable remedy to reverse or prevent unjust enrichment which is not based upon any agreement or common intention of the party enriched and the party deprived&#8221;. Then, at pp 231H-232A, he described the former principle as &#8220;part of the law of contract&#8221; and the latter, which seems, at least on the face of it, to cover the present case, as &#8220;part of the law of restitution&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Lord Hoffmann&#8217;s subsequent analysis at p 232B-H confirms that the Bank&#8217;s subrogation claim in this case should not be in difficulties because Melissa was wholly ignorant of, and in no way responsible for, the fact that the Bank was intended to have a charge over the freehold (and, as Lord Hoffmann explained, this is confirmed by a number of earlier decisions including two of the cases relied on by Mr Warwick, namely <span style="font-style:italic">Chetwynd </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Butler</span>). Thus, at p 234B-D, Lord Hoffmann observed that it was &#8220;a mistake to regard the availability of subrogation as a remedy to prevent unjust enrichment as turning entirely upon the question of intention&#8221; (although he also said that this does not &#8220;mean that questions of intention may not be highly relevant to the question whether or not enrichment has been unjust&#8221;). He also expressed the view that &#8220;intention has played so prominent a part in the earlier cases &#8230; because of the influence of cases on contractual subrogation&#8221;, and that, in a case of a restitutionary subrogation claim, the appropriate questions were, in effect, those identified by Lord Clarke at para 18 above.</p>

Accordingly, as he went on to say, the notion (in this case) of the unpaid vendor&#8217;s lien being &#8220;kept alive&#8221; for the benefit of the Bank was &#8220;not a literal truth but rather a metaphor or analogy&#8221; (p 236D). Particularly significantly for present purposes, Lord Hoffmann said at p 236F that subrogation is &#8220;an equitable remedy against a party who would otherwise be unjustly enriched&#8221; and &#8220;a means by which the court regulates the legal relationships between a plaintiff and a defendant &#8230; in order to prevent unjust enrichment&#8221;. Accordingly, he said, it would &#8220;not by any means follow that the [Bank] must for all purposes be treated as an actual assignee of the benefit of the [unpaid vendor&#8217;s lien] and, in particular, that [it] would be so treated in relation to someone who would not be unjustly enriched&#8221; (p 236G).</p>

The editors go on to say at para 39-12 that &#8220;subrogation to extinguished rights is therefore a remedy that reverses unjust enrichment of a discharged debtor &#8230; which follows from the discharge of a debt, by affording the claimant new rights which prima facie replicate the creditor&#8217;s extinguished rights&#8221;. The same point is made in the following paragraphs. For instance in para 39-16, it is suggested that &#8220;the subrogation cases can all be explained&#8221; on &#8220;the ground for restitution that makes it unjust for the debtor &#8230; to be enriched at the claimant&#8217;s expense&#8221;.</p>

However, that does not seem to me to present the Bank with a problem in relation to its claim for subrogation. For the reasons given in paras 66-68 above, the Bank has established that Melissa&#8217;s enrichment was at its expense even though the money did not emanate from the Bank directly, so that its unjust enrichment is made out against her. I do not see why the Bank need establish anything more in this case in order to make good its case to be subrogated to the Lien. It is right to add that para 7-02 of <span style="font-style:italic">Geoff &amp; Jones</span>, cited by Lord Carnwath in para 131 could be read as suggesting that a more stringent test has to be satisfied before the court will award subrogation (and see also paras 37-9 and 37-10).

Secondly, as Mr Rainey QC pointed out, at p 339A-B Millett LJ said that it would be &#8220;perilous to extrapolate from one set of circumstances where the court has required a particular precondition to be satisfied before the remedy of subrogation can be granted a general rule which makes that requirement a precondition which must be satisfied in other and different circumstances&#8221;. Similarly, at p 334H, Millett LJ described subrogation as a remedy which &#8220;will be fashioned to the circumstances&#8221;.</p>

However, and more to the point, Lord Millett&#8217;s remarks were directed to proprietary claims not unjust enrichment claims. Lord Millett made that clear in a passage at p 129E-G, where he said, <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span>, that one must distinguish between a claim brought &#8220;to vindicate &#8230; property rights&#8221; and one brought &#8220;to reverse unjust enrichment&#8221;, and that <span style="font-style:italic">Foskett </span>was an example of the former.

It would have been perfectly open to the Bank to have requested Boulters to pay the whole proceeds of the sale of Rush Green Hall to the Bank, with the Bank then remitting back to Boulters the &#163;875,000 needed to purchase Great Oak Court, on the basis that it would be subject to a charge in favour of the Bank to secure the Menelaou parents&#8217; indebtedness. If that had happened, and the Menelaou parents had then directed the transfer of Great Oak Court to Melissa, and the defective Deed had been executed, it is very difficult to see why the Bank could not have claimed subrogation to the unpaid vendor&#8217;s lien. If Melissa&#8217;s case on this appeal is right, the fact that the Bank sensibly short-circuited the process, and agreed that the &#163;875,000 could be retained by Boulters to purchase Great Oak Court, would mean that a small and practical change, of no apparent commercial significance, results in a substantially different commercial outcome. Such an outcome is, of course, possible, but its unattractiveness tends to support the conclusion which I have reached.</p>

At least on the basis of the arguments we have heard, I am very sympathetic to the notion that the Bank had a proprietary interest in the &#163;875,000 which was used to purchase Great Oak Court, and if that is right, its subrogation claim becomes relatively uncontroversial. I am, however, reluctant to express a concluded view on the topic, as the argument was developed very shortly, although it is fair to say that it was considered (and rejected) at first instance, albeit on a somewhat different basis from that which currently appeals to me.</p>

What was intended to happen on 12 September 2006 was that the proceeds of sale of Rush Green Hall, which was charged to the Bank for a debt in excess of those proceeds, were split into two portions, one of which was to be paid to the Bank to reduce the debt, and the other of which was to be used to purchase Great Oak Court on terms that the Bank was to have charge over it for the outstanding indebtedness. In those circumstances, it would seem, either the second portion was the Bank&#8217;s money beneficially subject to its agreement that the money could be used to purchase Great Oak Court, or it was the Menelaou parents&#8217; money beneficially subject to the Bank&#8217;s right to require it to be paid to the Bank to reduce the Menelaou parents&#8217; debt unless it was used to purchase Great Oak Court subject to the Charge.</p>

Both the Menelaou parents and the Bank were their clients towards whom they had contractual and equitable duties, and, more particularly, both of whom had an interest in the &#163;875,000. If the Bank beneficially owned the &#163;875,000 (subject to its agreement that the Menelaou parents could use it to purchase Great Oak Court, subject to the Charge), <span style="font-style:italic">cadit quaestio </span>so far as the Bank&#8217;s subrogation to the Lien is concerned, as I see it: the Bank&#8217;s money was used to redeem the Lien.<span style="font-style:italic"/>Assuming, however, that the Menelaou parents were the beneficial owners of the &#163;875,000, the Bank would, in my view, have had the right of requiring that sum to be used to purchase Great Oak Court subject to a Charge back in favour of the Bank, failing which the Bank would have the right to demand that that sum be paid to it. I find it hard to see why that would not have given the Bank a sufficient interest in the &#163;875,000 to enable it to claim to be subrogated to the Lien, even on Melissa&#8217;s restricted view of subrogation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I am less convinced with respect of the case for &#8220;rationalising&#8221; the older cases &#8220;through the prism of unjust enrichment&#8221;, as Lord Clarke suggests was done in <span style="font-style:italic">Banque Financi&#232;re</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">(Banque Financi&#232;re de la Cit&#233; v Parc (Battersea) Ltd</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 1 AC 221" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 1 AC 221</ref>), thus in effect conflating the two doctrines. As Lord Millett explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Foskett v McKeown </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 AC 102" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 AC 102</ref>, 129 (cited by Lord Clarke at para 38), there is a clear distinction of principle between a claim to enforce property rights and a claim for unjust enrichment. Earlier in the same judgment (at p 127F) he had emphasised that property rights are to be determined &#8220;by fixed rules and settled principles&#8221;, not by discretion or policy. Subrogation to a vendor&#8217;s lien is a claim to a property right, but it is, as Lord Clarke acknowledges, a less than straightforward concept. It should not be extended, nor should the established rules be distorted, without good reason.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Conversely, in the light of some decades of academic discussion and of the authorities reviewed by Lord Clarke, it is surely time for the principles of restitution or unjust enrichment to be allowed to stand on their own feet. A proprietary remedy may arguably be justified because, as Lord Neuberger says (paras 79-80), such a remedy, rather than a personal remedy, is the most appropriate response to the unjust enrichment found in this case; but not because of some tenuous relationship with a vendor&#8217;s lien which has no continuing existence or practical relevance. However, that is not how the case has been argued, and, since it is not necessary for my decision on the appeal, I shall limit my observations on those wider issues.</p>

I would only observe that I approach those facts without any particular predisposition in favour of the Bank&#8217;s claim. As Mr Warwick points out, if Melissa was enriched, it was because her parents gave to her, and to her two younger siblings, some of the proceeds of sale of their property, which she received in good faith. In the same way, Melissa&#8217;s older sister, Danielle, was enriched because she also received some of the proceeds of Rush Green Hall. Neither was aware of any interest of the Bank, and in Danielle&#8217;s case none has been asserted. Melissa&#8217;s ignorance of the Bank&#8217;s claim is the result of their own solicitors&#8217; incompetence, not of any fault on her part.</p>

In a case in which the whole of the secured debt is repaid, the charge is not kept alive at all. It is discharged and ceases to exist. &#8230; It is important to remember that, as Millett LJ pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Boscawen v Bajwa</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 1 WLR 328" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 1 WLR 328</ref>, 335, subrogation is not a right or a cause of action but an equitable remedy against a party who would otherwise be unjustly enriched. It is a means by which the court regulates the legal relationships between a plaintiff and a defendant or defendants in order to prevent unjust enrichment. When judges say that the charge is &#8216;kept alive&#8217; for the benefit of the plaintiff, what they mean is that his legal relations with a defendant who would otherwise be unjustly enriched are regulated as if the benefit of the charge had been assigned to him. It does not by any means follow that the plaintiff must for all purposes be treated as an actual assignee of the benefit of the charge and, in particular, that he would be so treated in relation to someone who would not be unjustly enriched.&#8221;(P 236D-E)</p>

A much simplified account will suffice. A building society (&#8220;Abbey National&#8221;) agreed to make an advance to clients for the purchase of a property from the defendant (Mr Bajwa) to be secured on a first legal charge. The property was subject to an existing mortgage in favour of another building society (&#8220;Halifax&#8221;). Abbey National paid the money to solicitors (Dave &amp; Co) acting jointly for the society and the purchaser, on terms which obliged them to use the money for the purchase, and to return it if for any reason completion did not take place. They transferred it to the vendors&#8217; solicitors (Hill Lawson) to hold to their order pending completion. Before completion Hill Lawson sent the money to Halifax in discharge of their mortgage, after which the sale fell through. In response to a subsequent claim to the property by judgment creditors of Mr Bajwa, the Abbey National claimed to be subrogated to the Halifax mortgage.</p>

But this is only one of the proprietary remedies which are available to a court of equity. If the plaintiff&#8217;s money has been applied by the defendant, for example, not in the acquisition of a landed property but in its improvement, then the court may treat the land as charged with the payment to the plaintiff of a sum representing the amount by which the value of the defendant&#8217;s land has been enhanced by the use of the plaintiff&#8217;s money. <span style="font-style:italic">And if the plaintiff&#8217;s money has been used to discharge a mortgage on the defendant's land, then the court may achieve a similar result by treating the land as subject to a charge by way of subrogation in favour of the plaintiff</span>.&#8221;</p>

It was held in favour of Abbey National that, as against Hill Lawson and Mr Bajwa, who though not wrongdoers were not &#8220;innocent volunteers&#8221;, they could rely on equity&#8217;s ability to follow money through a mixed bank account &#8220;by treating the money in the account as charged with the repayment of his money&#8221; (pp 336F, 337G).</p>

It was clearly regarded by Millett LJ as necessary for the claimants to establish that the money used to pay off the loan was<span style="font-style:italic"> their</span> money. &#8220;Tracing&#8221; was the process by which this was done. In the context of subrogation, tracing was not about identifying a particular asset in the hands of the defendant, as belonging notionally to the claimant; but rather as providing the necessary link with the payments made to discharge the relevant mortgage. In the passage quoted above, Millett LJ treated such payments as analogous to money spent in improving property. It was not regarded by him as sufficient to apply a broad causation or &#8220;economic reality&#8221; test, such as applied by the Court of Appeal in the present case. Had that been enough, the detailed examination of equitable rules relevant to tracing the money in the Hill Lawson account would have been unnecessary. It would have been enough that &#8220;but for&#8221; the receipt of the money from Abbey National, the Halifax mortgage would never have been paid off.</p>

Indeed, there are few more hotly debated issues among specialist academics in this field than the scope of the remedies, personal or proprietary, for unjust enrichment. In Mitchell and Watterson<span style="font-style:italic"/>(<span style="font-style:italic">op cit</span>), there is an illuminating discussion of the various strands of academic opinion as it stood at the time of that edition (2007). I note in particular two sections, headed &#8220;Proprietary remedies for unjust enrichment generally&#8221; (para 8.40ff) and &#8220;Proprietary subrogation&#8221; (para 8.46-7). The former notes, for example, the view of some commentators that the English law of unjust enrichment &#8220;should be purged of proprietary remedies altogether&#8221; (para 8.41); contrasted with other &#8220;more accommodating&#8221; approaches, such as that of Professor Andrew Burrows (<span style="font-style:italic">The</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">Law of Restitution, </span>2nd ed (2002), para 8.42) who accepts the need for special justification for a proprietary remedy, but finds it in two factors, that the payment added to the value of the defendant&#8217;s asset and that the claimant did not voluntarily assume the risk of the defendant&#8217;s insolvency. Against that backdrop, it is said, the subrogation authorities reveal &#8220;a surprising readiness&#8221; to award proprietary remedies. Following <span style="font-style:italic">Banque Financi&#232;re</span>, it is suggested that the courts should &#8220;look across from the subrogation authorities&#8221; to develop a consistent view of the circumstances in which proprietary restitutionary remedies should be awarded (para 8.46-7).</p>

Where the claimant seeks a personal remedy, he must show that there was a transfer of value between the parties, and this is tested by asking whether an event took place that caused the claimant to become worse off and the defendant to become better off. This is discussed in Chapter 6. In contrast, where the claimant seeks a proprietary remedy, it is not enough for him to show that there was a transfer of value between the parties: he must also show either that he previously owned the property in which he now claims an ownership or security interest, or else that the defendant acquired this property in exchange for property that was previously owned by the claimant, or else that this property was formerly the subject matter of an interest that was discharged with property that was previously owned by the claimant. <span style="font-style:italic">This test is more stringent than the causal test used in the context of personal claims, and it serves as a control mechanism to prevent proprietary restitutionary remedies from becoming too freely available</span>.&#8221; (para 7-02, emphasis added)</p>

A solicitor (Sims) had received money, lent by Twinsectra to his client (Mr Yardley) for the purchase of a property, under an undertaking that it would be utilised solely for the acquisition of property and for no other purpose. The money was paid to the defendant solicitor (Mr Leach), acting on behalf of the same client; he paid it out to the client who used it for purposes other than the purchase of the property. A claim against the defendant solicitor for dishonest assistance failed only because dishonesty was not established. The money was held to be subject to a trust in the first solicitor&#8217;s client account, the terms of which were found in the terms of the undertaking, which made clear that the money &#8220;was not to be at the free disposal of [the client]&#8221;:</p>

For example, if Mr Yardley went bankrupt before the money had been so applied, it would not have formed part of his estate, as it would have done if Sims had held it in trust for him absolutely. The undertaking would have ensured that Twinsectra could get it back. It follows that Sims held the money in <span style="font-style:italic">trust</span> for Twinsectra, but subject to a <span style="font-style:italic">power</span> to apply it by way of loan to Mr Yardley in accordance with the undertaking &#8230;&#8221; (paras 12-13, per Lord Hoffmann)</p>

(I do not understand either party to suggest that the deposit &#163;90,000 should be treated differently from the balance of &#163;785,000.)

In the present case the agreement or understanding recorded in the Bank&#8217;s letter of 9 September 2008 did not address the question of ownership or even security rights in the sale proceeds of Rush Green Hall, and had no reason to do so. While the arrival of the sale proceeds from Rush Green Hall and the payment of &#163;785,000 to the vendors of Great Oak Court (or their solicitors) and of &#163;750,000 to the Bank could not have been literally simultaneous, it is unrealistic to suppose that the parties were concerned with the status of the incoming monies in any short interval between them. Critically, the agreement was concerned only with the circumstances in which the charges over Rush Green Hall would be released. So long as they remained in place, there was neither need nor reason for the Bank to have any rights over the proceeds of sale, or thereafter, since the charges were only to be released against substitute security over Great Oak Court. And should there be a defect in that substitute security, the Bank had protected itself by obtaining the undertakings given by Boulters in the Certificate of Title.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">With respect to the judge, this analysis (like my own as trial judge in <span style="font-style:italic">Twinsectra</span>) seems to me to start from the wrong end. In the Boulters client account the money was undoubtedly trust money, in the sense that it was held beneficially for their clients (see eg <span style="font-style:italic">In re A Solicitor </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1952] Ch 328" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1952">[1952] Ch 328</ref>). That is not affected by the brevity of the period for which it was expected to be held. The relevant questions are: for whose benefit was it so held and on what terms? By this time they were acting for both the Menelaous and the Bank. Their respective interests in the money depended on the arrangements between them and with their solicitors. It is true that the Bank&#8217;s letter of 9 September 2008 said nothing in terms about an interest in the money to be used for the new purchase. But there is nothing to suggest that the money was treated as freely at the disposal of the Menelaous, which would have been inconsistent with the general purpose of the arrangement.</p>

I agree with Mr Rainey that in its context the reference in the certificate of title to the &#8220;mortgage advance&#8221; must be read as a reference to the money received by them from the sale of Rush Green Hall.
