	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">These proceedings arise out of a fatal accident in Germany. On 21 May 2004, Major Christopher Cox, an officer serving with H.M. Forces in Germany, was riding his bicycle on the verge of a road near his base when a car left the road and hit him, causing injuries from which he died. The driver was Mr Gunther Kretschmer, a German national resident and domiciled in Germany. He was insured by the respondent, a German insurance company, under a contract governed by German law. The appellant, Major Cox&#8217;s widow Katerina, was living with him in Germany at the time of the accident. After the accident, she returned to England where she has at all relevant times been domiciled. Since then, she has entered into a new relationship and has had two children with her new partner.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is common ground that the liabilities of Mr Kretschmer and his insurer are governed by German law. It is also common ground that under paragraph 3(1) of the Pflichtversicherungsgesetz, Mrs Cox had a direct right of action against Mr Kretschmer&#8217;s insurer for such loss as she would have been entitled to recover from him. That being so, the combined effect of articles 9 and 11 of Regulation EC 44/2001 is that she is entitled to sue the insurer in the courts of the member state where she is domiciled. She has availed herself of that right by suing the insurers in England for bereavement and loss of dependency.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Liability is not in dispute, but there is a number of issues relating to damages. Their resolution depends on whether they are governed by German or English law, and if by English law, whether by the provisions of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/30" uk:canonical="1976 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Fatal Accidents Act 1976</ref> or on some other basis. Mrs Cox relies on both English and German law. The question which law applies was ordered to be tried as a preliminary issue, together with other issues which are no longer in dispute.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In German law, the extent of Mrs Cox&#8217;s recoverable loss is governed by section 844 of the B&#369;rgerliches Gezetzbuch (or &#8220;BGB&#8221;). Section 844(2) provides, so far as relevant:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Sir Christopher Holland, who decided the preliminary issues in the High Court, heard expert evidence about the effect of section 844(2) and made a number of findings: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/qb/2011/2806" uk:canonical="[2011] EWHC 2806 (QB)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 2806 (QB)</ref>. These findings have not themselves been appealed, and provide the point of departure for the questions before us. In summary, Sir Christopher held that the object of section 844 of the BGB was to restore the claimant to the financial position that she would have been in as a dependant of the deceased, but for his death, taking account of any subsequent benefits received which impact on the loss of dependancy, apart from insurance recoveries. These subsequent benefits may include the income that the claimant has made or would be likely to make by taking paid employment, together with any maintenance accruing to the claimant through her remarriage or through some other relationship following the birth of a child. &#8220;Fundamental to the foregoing,&#8221; he found, at para 17, &#8220;is a substantive requirement of German law: the duty to mitigate, such justifying ongoing reference to her earning capacity and to benefits accruing from remarriage or from a similar relationship.&#8221;</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Broadly speaking, German law on the damages recoverable for a fatal accident corresponds to the general principles applied at common law to the recoverability of damages in tort, which require the claimant to be put into a financial position equivalent to that which she would have been in but for the wrong. To that end, account must be taken of avoided or reasonably avoidable loss. In England, however, the law relating to liability for fatal accidents is almost entirely statutory. Before 1846, English law did not permit actions in tort for the death of a human being. This was the combined result of two rules of common law. The first was that the right of action of a person who had been tortiously injured was a personal action, which did not survive for the benefit of his estate upon his death. This rule survived until 1934, when it was abolished by the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act. The second rule was that &#8220;[i]n a civil court, the death of a human being could not be complained of as an injury&#8221; by dependants claiming in their own right: <span style="font-style:italic">Baker v Bolton</span> (1808) 1 Camp 493 (Lord Ellenborough). This is still the rule at common law, but it was largely superseded by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/9-10/93" uk:canonical="1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict.) c. 93" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Fatal Accidents Act 1846</ref> (&#8220;Lord Campbell&#8217;s Act&#8221;), which created a new statutory cause of action in favour of certain categories of dependant, including widows. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/9-10/93" uk:canonical="1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict.) c. 93" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The 1846 Act</ref> was repeatedly amended, elaborated and re-enacted, and the statutory cause of action is now contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/30/section/1/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(1)</ref> and (2) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/30" uk:canonical="1976 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Fatal Accidents Act 1976</ref>.

The appeal arose out of an action in England for personal injury caused by a road accident in New South Wales. Under New South Wales law, damages were limited by the Chapter V of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (known as the &#8220;MACA&#8221;). Section 123 of the MACA provided that &#8220;[a] court cannot award damages to a person in a respect of a motor accident contrary to this Chapter.&#8221; The Chapter then provided for a fixed limit to the damages and a number of detailed rules for awarding them. These included an exclusion of the first five days of earning capacity, an exclusion of economic loss, a specified discount rate to be used to calculate lump sum awards, and a rule requiring credit to be given for payments received from an insurer. The House rejected the view that in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42/section/14/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 14(3)</ref>(b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42" uk:canonical="1995 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of 1995, &#8220;questions of procedure&#8221; referred only to rules governing the manner in which proceedings were to be conducted. They distinguished between questions of recoverability (substantive) and questions of assessment (procedural). At common law the kinds of damage recoverable was a question of substance, whereas their quantification or assessment went to the availability and extent of the remedy and as such were questions of procedure for the law of the forum. The House classified all the relevant provisions of the MACA as rules of procedure. They were accordingly inapplicable to litigation in England. The leading speech was delivered by Lord Hoffmann, with whom the rest of the House agreed. Lord Hoffmann stated the principle at para 24 as follows:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.50in">&#8220;In applying this distinction to actions in tort, the courts have distinguished between the kind of <span style="font-style:italic">damage </span>which constitutes an actionable injury and the assessment of compensation (ie <span style="font-style:italic">damages) </span>for the injury which has been held to be actionable. The identification of actionable damage is an integral part of the rules which determine liability. As I have previously had occasion to say, it makes no sense simply to say that someone is liable in tort. He must be liable <span style="font-style:italic">for </span>something and the rules which determine what he is liable for are inseparable from the rules which determine the conduct which gives rise to liability. Thus the rules which exclude damage from the scope of liability on the grounds that it does not fall within the ambit of the liability rule or does not have the prescribed causal connection with the wrongful act, or which require that the damage should have been reasonably foreseeable, are all rules which determine whether there is liability for the damage in question. On the other hand, whether the claimant is awarded money damages (and if so, how much) or, for example, restitution in kind, is a question of remedy.&#8221;</p>

This seems surprising as regards some of them, such as the exclusion of economic loss, which would appear to be substantive according to Lord Hoffmann&#8217;s test. This may be why in their concurring judgments Lord Woolf and Lord Rodger of Earlsferry justified this classification not only on the grounds given by Lord Hoffmann but on additional grounds. Lord Woolf at para 11 considered that because the greater part of the provisions of the MACA relating to damages were procedural, the rest which were &#8220;arguably&#8221; substantive should be regarded as procedural also. Lord Bingham and Lord Carswell agreed with Lord Rodger as well as Lord Hoffmann. Lord Rodger found the answer in the opening words of section 123 of the MACA. He put the point as follows at para 73:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.50in">&#8220;Section 122(1) of MACA explains that Chapter 5 applies to, and in respect of, &#8216;an award of damages&#8217; relating to death or injury in motor accidents. Section 123 provides that: &#8216;A court cannot award damages to a person in respect of a motor accident contrary to this Chapter.&#8217; While, of course, it may be necessary to look beneath the surface of a statutory provision to ascertain its nature, the legislature is here signalling that the provisions in Chapter 5 are directed to what a New South Wales court can award by way of damages. In other words, prima facie at least, they are concerned, not with the scope of the defendant's liability for the victim&#8217;s injuries as such, but with the remedy which the courts of New South Wales can give to compensate for those injuries. For purposes of private international law, prima facie they are procedural in nature.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I consider that the relevant German damages rules are substantive. This is because they determine the scope of the liability. Sir Christopher Holland has found that the rule of German law requiring credit to be given for maintenance received from a subsequent partner, reflects the principle requiring the victim of a tort to mitigate loss and to give credit for successful mitigation. In German law this is classified as a substantive rule. Its classification in an English court is a question of English law, but English law would regard it in the same light. Questions of causation are substantive, as Lord Hoffmann pointed out in the passage which I have quoted from <span style="font-style:italic">Harding v Wealands</span>. Such questions include questions of mitigation, because they determine the extent of the loss for which the defendant ought fairly, reasonably or justly to be held liable. &#8220;The inquiry is whether the plaintiff&#8217;s harm or loss should be within the scope of the defendant&#8217;s liability, given the reasons why the law has recognised the cause of action in question&#8221;: <span style="font-style:italic">Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (Nos 4 and 5)</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 2 AC 883" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 2 AC 883</ref>, at para 70 (Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead). The rule of German law which makes damages available for psychological distress in certain circumstances, and makes damages for bereavement as such unavailable, is also substantive. These are paradigm examples of rules governing the recoverability of particular heads of loss, the avoidance of which lies within the scope of the defendant&#8217;s duty.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Turning to the categorisation of the relevant damages provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act, the Court of Appeal considered that they were procedural. Having arrived at this conclusion, they were much exercised by the difficulty of applying the damages rules of the Fatal Accidents Act to a cause of action under section 844 of the BGB, given the considerable differences between them; and the absence of any alternative basis for assessing damages for wrongfully causing death under English law. The majority considered that the damages rules in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42" uk:canonical="1995 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> could not be regarded as relevant to an assessment of damages for the German cause of action, because the conceptual differences between the English and German causes of action were too great. They therefore held that English law should adopt the German damages rules as its own and apply them not directly but by analogy. Dame Janet Smith dissented on the ground that in her opinion the Fatal Accidents Act applied as part of the <span style="font-style:italic">lex fori</span>, notwithstanding the differences between the English and German causes of action.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I agree with the majority of the Court of Appeal that the damages rules of the Fatal Accidents Act cannot be applied to a cause of action under section 844 of the BGB, but for an altogether simpler reason than the conceptual differences between the two laws. In my view it is unnecessary to engage in the difficult and technical task of classifying <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 1</ref>A, 3 and 4 of the Fatal Accidents Act as procedural or substantive, because these sections are irrelevant in either case. So far as they are substantive, they are irrelevant because the substantive law in this case is German law. But whether they are procedural or substantive, they do not apply under their own terms. These provisions do not lay down general rules of English law relating to the assessment of damages, even in personal injury actions, but only rules applicable to actions under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42" uk:canonical="1995 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> itself. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Sections 1</ref>A, 3(3), 3(4) and 4, which include the provisions relevant to the present appeal, apply only to &#8220;an action under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42" uk:canonical="1995 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">this Act</ref>&#8221;, i.e. to actions brought under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">If the English court must apply its own rules of assessment, then what rules are these, if not those of the Fatal Accidents Act? I do not think that it is necessary to resort to analogies, because English law does provide a remedy that harmonises with the German law right, namely damages. Mr Kretschmer committed a tort under German law, and thereby incurred a substantive liability to pay financial compensation. The principal head of loss for which he was liable to compensate Major Cox&#8217;s widow was the deprivation of the net financial benefit to her of her legal right to maintenance from him. This is entirely cognate with the corresponding remedy in English law. It is true, as the Court of Appeal pointed out, that because the cause of action in English law for a fatal accident is an action under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42/section/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42" uk:canonical="1995 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, there is no non-statutory measure of damages for fatal accidents. But this does not matter. If, as I consider, the particular rules of assessment in the Fatal Accidents Act do not apply as a matter of construction of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42" uk:canonical="1995 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, then the answer must be sought in the rules of assessment which apply generally in English law in the absence of any statute displacing them. The relevant English law principle of assessment, which applies in the absence of any statute to the contrary, is that Mrs Cox must be put in the same financial position, neither better nor worse, as she would have been in if her husband had not been fatally injured. It follows that even if one assumes, for the sake of argument, that the Court of Appeal were right to regard the damages rules of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42" uk:canonical="1995 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> as procedural, in principle credit must be given for maintenance from her subsequent partner during the period since the birth of their child. This is because damages at common law are assessed on the footing that credit must be given for receipts referable to the original loss, with very limited exceptions such as insurance receipts which are not relevant in this case. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The only potential difficulty concerns Mrs Cox&#8217;s receipt of maintenance from her current partner during the period before they had a child, when he was under no legal obligation to maintain her either in German or in English law. It appears from Sir Christopher Holland&#8217;s findings about the relevant German law that it is not just the maintenance that she would have received from Major Cox that must have been received by virtue of a legal obligation, but also the maintenance from her current partner for which she can be required to give credit. The classification of a damages rule regulating the receipts for which credit must be given in an award of damages is a difficult question which admits of no universal answer. In some cases, such a rule will be classed as part of the law of mitigation and therefore substantive. In some cases it will be regarded as a rule excluding an otherwise relevant element from a purely factual issue about quantum, which would normally be classified as procedural: see <span style="font-style:italic">Roerig v Valiant Trawlers Ltd</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 1 WLR 2304" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 1 WLR 2304</ref>, para 23, and <span style="font-style:italic">Coupland v Arabian Gulf Oil Co</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1983] 1 WLR 1136" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1983">[1983] 1 WLR 1136</ref>, 1149, concerning a foreign statutory rule about the deductibility of social security receipts. In the present case, the rule in question seems to me to be substantive for a reason peculiar to the nature of the German cause of action relied upon in this case. Mrs Cox is entitled as a matter of German substantive law to an award of damages for the loss of her legal right of maintenance from her late husband. German law requires credit to be given so far as she has received corresponding benefits by virtue of an alternative legal right of maintenance from someone else. This follows from the nature of the duty in German law and of the head of damages recoverable for breach of it. It is a rule of substantive law. Purely voluntary payments from someone with no legal obligation to make them cannot be regarded as an alternative to what she has lost. It follows that credit need not be given for it. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is not at all satisfactory that such significant consequences should turn on difficult and technical considerations of the kind considered in the previous paragraph. Under the law as it stood at the time of this accident, it was at least in theory possible that assessment rules of the forum could conflict with the substantive rules of the proper law. How that conflict should be resolved if it ever arose is a question on which I should prefer to express no opinion. The rational answer is that someone in Mrs Cox&#8217;s position should recover in respect of a German cause of action what she would have recovered in a German court. This has now been achieved by changing the law. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 15</ref>A of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42" uk:canonical="1995 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of 1995 (added by amendment in 2008) applies the Rome II Regulation EC 864/2007 to causes of action arising after 11 January 2009.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Whether an English statute applies extra-territorially depends upon its construction. There is, however, a presumption against extra-territorial application which is more or less strong depending on the subject-matter. It arises from the fact that, except in relation to the acts of its own citizens abroad and certain crimes of universal jurisdiction such as torture and genocide, the exercise of extra-territorial jurisdiction is contrary to ordinary principles of international law governing the jurisdiction of states. It follows, as Lord Scarman observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Clark v Oceanic Contractors Inc</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1983] 2 AC 130" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1983">[1983] 2 AC 130</ref>, 145, that &#8220;unless the contrary is expressly enacted <span style="font-size:14pt">or </span>so plainly implied that the courts must give effect to it, United Kingdom legislation is applicable only to British subjects or to foreigners who by coming to the <span style="font-size:14pt">United </span>Kingdom, whether for <span style="font-size:13.5pt">a </span>short or <span style="font-size:13.5pt">a </span>long time, have made themselves subject to British jurisdiction&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is, however, important to understand what is meant when we talk of the extra-territorial application of an English statute. There are two distinct questions, which are not always distinguished in the case-law. The first question is what is the proper law of the relevant liability. The answer will usually depend on the extent of any connection between the facts giving rise to liability and England or English law. If the proper law of the liability is English law, no question of extra-territorial application arises. In principle the exercise is no different from that which the court performs when it identifies the proper law of a non-statutory tort, by reference to the connection between the facts and the various alternative systems of law. This is what Lord Hodson (at p 380) and Lord Wilberforce (at pp 390-392) did in <span style="font-style:italic">Boys v Chaplin</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1971] AC 356" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1971">[1971] AC 356</ref>, when they held that liability in respect of a road accident in Malta in which only English parties were involved was governed by English law. The same basic principle has applied under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 11</ref> and 12 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42" uk:canonical="1995 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995</ref> since <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42" uk:canonical="1995 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref> came into force. The second question is one of extra-territorial application, properly so-called. It is the question posed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42/section/14/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 14(3)</ref>(a)(i) and 14(4) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42" uk:canonical="1995 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995</ref>, which had its counterpart in the common law, namely whether the choice of law arrived at in accordance with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 11</ref> and 12 is displaced by some mandatory rule of the forum. This is not a choice of law principle at all, but turns on the overriding rules of policy of the forum.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In the present case it is common ground that the <span style="font-style:italic">lex causae</span> arrived at on ordinary principles of private international law is not English but German law. There is nothing in the language of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/30" uk:canonical="1976 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Fatal Accidents Act 1976</ref> to suggest that its provisions were intended to apply irrespective of the choice of law derived from ordinary principles of private international law. Such an intention would therefore have to be implied. Implied extra-territorial effect is certainly possible, and there are a number of examples of it. But in most if not all cases, it will arise only if (i) the terms of the legislation cannot effectually be applied or its purpose cannot effectually be achieved unless it has extra-territorial effect; or (ii) the legislation gives effect to a policy so significant in the law of the forum that Parliament must be assumed to have intended that policy to apply to any one resorting to an English court regardless of the law that would otherwise apply.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">There is a body of case-law in which the Fatal Accidents Acts have been applied to accidents outside England. In <span style="font-style:italic">Davidsson v Hill</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1901] 2 KB 606" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1901">[1901] 2 KB 606</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/9-10/93" uk:canonical="1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict.) c. 93" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Fatal Accidents Act 1846</ref> was applied to the death of a foreign seaman on a foreign ship, resulting from a collision with a British ship on the high seas. The reason was that the existence of a cause of action in favour of dependants of a person negligently killed was regarded as a universal principle which should be treated as part of the international law maritime: see Kennedy J at pp 610, 614 and Phillimore J at pp 616, 618. In <span style="font-style:italic">The Esso Malaysia</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1975] 1 QB 198" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1975">[1975] 1 QB 198</ref>, 24 Russian crewmen serving on a Latvian trawler were killed when it collided with a Panamanian tanker on the high seas. Jurisdiction was established in England by arresting a sister ship. Brandon J held, following <span style="font-style:italic">Davidsson v Hill</span>, that the rule which imposed liability for negligently causing a fatal injury was a universal rule of the law maritime. On that footing, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Vict/9-10/93" uk:canonical="1846 (9 &amp; 10 Vict.) c. 93" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Fatal Accidents Act 1846</ref> applied, because its effect was not to create new rules of conduct, but only to regulate the consequences of existing rules of conduct: see p 206. These cases depend, in my opinion, on (i) the existence of an international principle of liability for negligent acts, which is to be regarded as part of the law maritime, coupled with (ii) the absence of any more appropriate system of law than English law to govern the precise incidents, extent and conditions of that liability. The peculiarity of the cases about collisions in international waters lies in the absence of any relevant connection between the breach of duty and the territory of any state, or of any underlying relationship between the parties, from which some more appropriate choice of law could be derived. In <span style="font-style:italic">Roerig v Valiant Trawlers</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 1 WLR 2304" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 1 WLR 2304</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/30/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 3</ref> and 4 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1976/30" uk:canonical="1976 c. 30" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Fatal Accidents Act 1976</ref> were also applied, but on a different basis. There were relevant connections with English law because the accident occurred on a British vessel with no other vessel involved, and also with Dutch law because the vessel was operating out of the Netherlands and the deceased was a Dutchman working for a Dutch company. The Dutch factors were held to be insufficiently significant to displace the <span style="font-style:italic">lex loci delicti</span>, which was English. These cases all, in different ways, turn on the choice of law arising from the circumstances of the case. None of them were about the extra-territorial effect of any statute. Indeed, in <span style="font-style:italic">The Esso Malaysia</span> at p 207, Brandon J declined to consider that question.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Fatal Accidents Act is an unpromising candidate for implied extra-territorial effect. In the first place, the question of extra-territorial application could not have been an issue at the time when <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/18" uk:canonical="1996 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> of 1976 and its predecessors were passed. This is because actions brought in England on a foreign tort were then subject to the double-actionability rule, which was a procedural rule requiring the conduct alleged to be actionable under English law as well as by its proper law. The practical effect of the rule was not to displace the law governing the tort, but to make it pointless ever to rely on that law because the elements of the tort in English law had to be satisfied anyway. The double-actionability rule had its origin in <span style="font-style:italic">Philips v Eyre</span>(1870) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="LR 6 QB 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">LR 6 QB 1</ref>, and was no doubt based on the tacit instinct of English judges that they should not be required to enforce values underlying the law of tort in foreign countries, which might not be acceptable in England. The Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1995 abolished the double-actionability rule and introduced rules requiring English courts to apply to claims in tort the law which had the most significant connection with the wrong, subject to an altogether more limited saving for the public policy of the forum applicable only in those cases where a specific foreign law was found to be repugnant to the policy of the forum.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Thirdly, there is no reason whatsoever why Parliament should have intended the Fatal Accidents Act to apply to foreign fatal accidents with no connection to England or English law. Neither the terms nor the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/18" uk:canonical="1996 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> depend for their effect on its having extra-territorial effect. The only other basis for imputing to Parliament an intention to apply the Fatal Accidents Act internationally irrespective of ordinary rules of private international law, is that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/18" uk:canonical="1996 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, and in particular its damages rules, represent a &#8220;mandatory rule&#8221;. This is the expression commonly employed to describe what the Law Commissions of England and Scotland have called &#8220;rules of&#8230; domestic law&#8230; regarded as so important that as a matter of construction or policy that they must apply in any action before a court of the forum, even where the issues are in principle governed by a foreign law selected by a foreign choice of law rule&#8221;: Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission Working Paper No. 87 (1984), para. 4.5. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42/section/14/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 14(3)</ref>(a)(i) an 14(4) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/42" uk:canonical="1995 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Private International Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1995</ref> have the effect of saving such rules. Some foreign laws governing the availability of damages for fatal accidents may no doubt be so offensive to English legal policy that effect would not be given to them in an English court. A rule of foreign law that women or ethnic minorities should have half the damages awardable to white males similarly placed was cited as an example. But the German rules with which this case is concerned are based on a perfectly orthodox principle which is by no means unjust and is accepted in principle by English common law in every other context than statutory liability for fatal accidents.</p>

(The distinction has, for torts committed since 11 January 2009, been, happily, superseded by Rome II Regulation EC 864/2007, article 15(c).)

The rules governing these matters are, as Lord Hoffmann indicated in para 24, rules which determine the scope of a defendant&#8217;s liability, or &#8220;for what&#8221; he is liable.

The House of Lords there refused in English proceedings to apply chapter 5 of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act (&#8220;MACA&#8221;), which would have regulated the damages recoverable had the matter been litigated in Australia. The application of the difficult distinction between substantive and procedural issues may on the facts of that case appear in some respects questionable. What is presently interesting is the acceptance by members of the House of Lords that the relevant chapter, chapter 5, contained provisions that &#8220;traditionally fall on the substantive side of the line for purposes of private international law&#8221;: per Lord Rodger, para 74, and see per Lord Woolf, para 11. Yet both held (paras 11 and 77), with Lords Bingham and Carswell agreeing (paras 1 and 79), that chapter 5 was a code the whole of which was to be characterised as procedural.</p>

These included a requirement that credit be given for payments made to the claimant by an insurer &#8211; on its face a mitigating receipt. The most convincing explanations of the House of Lords&#8217; decision that all aspects of the MACA were procedural seem to me in these circumstances either the package argument accepted by Lord Woolf (para 11) and perhaps also the argument that the MACA was a remedy intended only for use in Australian courts argument (see per Lord Rodger, para 75). Neither explanation affects the relevance or applicability of article 844 BGB as part of the relevant substantive law on the facts of this case. </p>

That may be open to question.

This is not because I think that their impact must necessarily be confined to claims under the FAA, simply because that is their domestic context - private international law may require the application of procedures developed in a purely domestic context to claims governed by foreign law. Rather it is because I do not, in this context, see any basis on which an English procedural provision could expand on a defendant&#8217;s liability under the substantive principles of the relevant governing law. So here an English procedural rule precluding account from being taken of re-marriage or the prospects of remarriage could not override the substantive rule under article 844 BGB by which credit is required to be given for maintenance received by way of legal right from a subsequent partner. </p>
