On 29 January 2003 he was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, with a punishment part of 25 years. By a note of appeal which was lodged on 18 December 2003 he appealed against his conviction and sentence. He was granted leave to appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">Although the Advocate Depute withdrew this charge at the end of the Crown case, he relied on the evidence that the rings had been discovered in the house on 7 May 1998 as a crucial part of the circumstantial evidence against the appellant that he had arranged for his wife to be killed. In his address to the jury he said that the discovery of the rings was a most compelling piece of evidence. He invited the jury to conclude that eight or nine days after Arlene Fraser&#8217;s death the appellant had removed the rings from her dead body, taken them to the house and placed them in the bathroom to make it look as though she had decided to walk away from the life that she had had there. He described the return of the rings as the cornerstone of the case against the appellant, for which he had provided no explanation. The trial judge directed the jury that, if they reached the view that they were not prepared to hold that it was the appellant who placed the rings in the bathroom on 7 May, it would not be open to them to convict the appellant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The case was presented on the assumption, for which unchallenged evidence had been led, that the rings were not in the bathroom when Arlene Fraser disappeared. But it came to the notice of Crown Office after the appeal was lodged that, when he was precognosced by a Crown precognition officer on 3 July 2002, PC Neil Lynch had stated that he had visited the house on three occasions during the night of 28 and 29 April 1998 and that on the final visit he was accompanied by WPC Julie Clark. He said that on the night of 28 April and the morning of 29 April he had seen jewellery, including rings, in the house and that before the official search began he had thought he saw bracelets and rings in the bathroom which looked like a wedding ring, an engagement ring or an eternity ring. This information had not been recorded in PC Lynch&#8217;s notebook and it was not included in any statement provided by him prior to the trial. It was not provided prior to or during the trial to the Advocate Depute, nor was it provided to the appellant&#8217;s representatives. PC Lynch and WPC Clark had not been precognosced by the defence in the course of their preparations for the trial.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Inquiries were then instigated, in the course of which a further precognition was taken from PC Lynch and WPC Clark was also precognosced. When he was precognosced on 8 February 2006 PC Lynch said that he first attended the house with WPC Clark around 10.30 pm to 11.00 pm on 28 April 1998 and that during this visit he saw jewellery in the bathroom. His recollection was that there were two or three rings there and a chain necklace, or maybe two. The rings were wedding, engagement or eternity type rings. When she was precognosced on 2 March 2006 WPC Clark said that either on the night of 28 April or in the early hours of 29 April she saw jewellery in the bathroom. There were at least two finger rings and a chain, and one of the rings could have been a lady&#8217;s wedding ring or an eternity ring. This information had not been recorded in her notebook and it was not included in any statement provided by her before the trial.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The information which had been obtained on precognition from PC Lynch and WPC Clark was disclosed to the appellant on 8 March 2006. On 11 March 2006 a statement was issued by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in which it was said that the Lord Advocate regarded it as a matter of serious concern that this evidence was not made available to the defence before the trial. The Area Procurator Fiscal for Glasgow, Catherine Dyer, and the Deputy Chief Constable of Strathclyde, Richard Gray, were asked to carry out a full investigation. They reported on 30 October 2006. In the course of their investigation they interviewed the Advocate Depute, now the Hon Lord Turnbull. He said that he thought at an early stage of his involvement in the case that the rings were the key piece of evidence, and that the information in PC Lynch&#8217;s precognition was so inconsistent with his thinking that if it had come to light during the trial it would have had to have been deserted.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In the light of the information disclosed by the Crown the appellant lodged additional grounds of appeal in May 2006. These were followed by revised additional grounds in February 2007, in which it was submitted that there had been a miscarriage of justice because the evidence of PC Lynch and WPC Clark was not heard at the trial and because the Crown had failed to disclose the information that PC Lynch had provided when he was precognosced on 3 July 2002. The appeal was set down for hearing by the Appeal Court (the Lord Justice Clerk (Lord Gill), Lord Osborne and Lord Johnston) in November 2007.</p>

In the devolution minute it was stated that the appellant intended to raise a devolution issue on the following grounds:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Appeal Court refused the motion for the additional ground of appeal and the devolution minute to be received. The reasons that it gave for this decision were that they came too late, that sufficient cause had not been shown and that the matters sought to be raised were adequately covered by the existing grounds of appeal. In the course of the hearing, which occupied a total of 13 days, the appellant&#8217;s counsel restricted his argument to the question whether there had been a miscarriage of justice on the ground of fresh evidence within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46" uk:canonical="1995 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995</ref>, and on the ground of non-disclosure which he accepted was in effect a duplication of the first ground. The non-disclosure ground of appeal was therefore treated in the same way as the fresh evidence appeal. On 6 May 2008 the Appeal Court refused the appeal against conviction and continued the appeal against sentence to a date to be afterwards fixed: [2008] HCJAC 26, 2008 SCCR 407. The appeal against sentence was subsequently abandoned. The appellant then sought leave of the Appeal Court to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council against the Appeal Court&#8217;s refusal to allow the devolution minute to be received.</p>

Delivering the opinion of the court, Lord Osborne said in para 13 that the identification of the devolution issue depended on the content of the devolution minute which had been tendered and rejected on 13 November 2007.</p>

What decision they might or might not reach in any such appeal can only be a matter of conjecture at this stage. However, what is clear is that the allowance of leave for such an appeal as this would authorise a procedure under which the Judicial Committee, in the circumstances of this case, would, quite simply, review the merits of the decision reached by this court on 6 May 2008. Whatever was contemplated by Parliament in enacting paragraphs 1(c) and 13 of Schedule 6 to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/46" uk:canonical="1998 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Scotland Act 1998</ref>, we do not think that it was intended to achieve such a result as that. Had it been the intention of Parliament to introduce, for the first time, a right of appeal to the Privy Council against the merits of decisions by the High Court of Justiciary determining appeals to it under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46" uk:canonical="1995 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1995 Act</ref>, we are of the opinion that it would have made that intention clear.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The tests set out in <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span> fall into two parts which, as I said in para 19, must be considered and applied separately. First, there is the test that is to be applied in order to decide whether the material which was withheld from the defence is material which ought to have been disclosed to it. The test here is whether the material might have materially weakened the Crown case or might materially have strengthened the case for the defence. As was explained in <span style="font-style:italic">HM Advocate v Murtagh</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/jcpc/2009/35" uk:canonical="[2009] UKPC 35" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] UKPC 35</ref>, 2010 SC (PC) 39, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 3 WLR 816" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 3 WLR 816</ref>, para 11, this test was identified by Lord Justice General Rodger in <span style="font-style:italic">McLeod v HM Advocate (No 2) </span>1998 JC 67. He said that the duty of disclosure was an aspect of the role of the Crown as it had been understood since <span style="font-style:italic">Slater v HM Advocate </span>1928 JC 94; see also <span style="font-style:italic">Downie v HM Advocate </span>1952 JC 37, p 40 per Lord Justice General Cooper; <span style="font-style:italic">Smith v HM Advocate</span> 1952 JC 66, p 72 per Lord Justice Clerk Thomson. As Lord Rodger said in <span style="font-style:italic">McLeod</span> at p 79F-G, our system of criminal procedure proceeds on the basis that the Crown have a duty at any time to disclose to the defence information in their possession which would tend to exculpate the accused. This test is well settled in Scots law and in the jurisprudence of this court: see <span style="font-style:italic">Sinclair v HM Advocate </span>2005 SC (PC) 28, para 33; <span style="font-style:italic">Allison v HM Advocate </span>2010 SLT 261, paras 25-28. There are, no doubt, various ways of expressing it. In his <span style="font-style:italic">Review of the Law and Practice of Disclosure in Criminal Proceedings in Scotland </span>(Scottish Government, Edinburgh, 2007), para 5.46 Lord Coulsfield recommended that it should be the duty of the prosecutor to disclose to the defence all material evidence or information which would tend to exculpate the accused whether by weakening the Crown case or providing a defence to it. But the way it was set out in <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span>, paras 19 and 28, can be taken to be the definitive way of expressing the test.</p>

	  <num style="font-size:13pt">14.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Then there is the test which is set out in <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span>, paras 20, 24 and 30. It is directed to the consequences of the violation. A failure by the Lord Advocate to disclose to the defence material which, applying the first test, ought to have been disclosed to it is incompatible with the accused&#8217;s article 6 Convention right to a fair trial: <span style="font-style:italic">Rowe and Davis v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2000) 30 EHRR 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">(2000) 30 EHRR 1</ref>, para 60; <span style="font-style:italic">Edwards v United Kingdom</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1992) 15 EHRR 417" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">(1992) 15 EHRR 417</ref>, para 36; <span style="font-style:italic">Dowsett v United Kingdom </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2003) 38 EHRR 845" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">(2003) 38 EHRR 845</ref>, paras 42, 43. At this stage the significance and consequences of the violation must be assessed. The question is whether, given that there was a failure to disclose and having regard to what actually happened at the trial, the trial was nevertheless fair. It was in order to indicate more precisely what &#8220;fair&#8221; means in this context that the court went on to give this further guidance. The test that is to be applied to determine this issue is whether, taking all the circumstances of the trial into account, there is a real possibility that the jury would have arrived at a different verdict if the withheld material had been disclosed to the defence. The decision of the Appeal Court (Lady Paton, Lord Hardie and Lady Smith) in <span style="font-style:italic">Hay v HM Advocate </span>[2010] HCJAC 125, 2011 SLT 293 provides a good illustration of a case where the application of that test may lead to the refusal of an appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The question in this appeal, therefore, is whether the way the Appeal Court dealt with the non-disclosure aspects of the appeal satisfies the requirements of these two tests. This is not an easy question to answer as, having refused to entertain the appellant&#8217;s devolution minute, the Appeal Court dealt with all aspects of the appeal as a fresh evidence appeal which was regulated by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46" uk:canonical="1995 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1995 Act</ref>: 2008 SCCR 407, para 131.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;Since there is no devolution issue in this appeal, I need not consider the points that the advocate depute raised about the test in appeals to the Privy Council.

If I am right, the test set by Lord Justice General Emslie in <span style="font-style:italic">Cameron v HM Advocate </span>[1991 JC 252, at 262], and followed by this court for over 20 years, applies to both grounds of appeal.&#8221;</p>

If we can be satisfied that there is no material difference between the tests that the Appeal Court actually applied and the <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes </span>tests, that will be an end to the case. That is because, as I said in <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span>, para 18, the jurisdiction of this court does not extend to the question whether, having identified the right tests, they were applied correctly by the Appeal Court. But we cannot avoid looking at what the Appeal Court did to see whether the tests that it applied were so similar to what the <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes </span>tests require that it made no difference whether the appeal was decided as a fresh evidence appeal or under the Convention.</p>

But in this case, as it is an appeal in which a devolution issue has been raised but which was determined by the Appeal Court solely by applying Lord Justice General Emslie&#8217;s test as if it were a fresh evidence appeal only, it is not possible to be so reticent.

First, there is what may be described as the threshold test: assuming that this is evidence that satisfies the statutory requirement that it was not heard at the original proceedings and there is a reasonable explanation of why it was not so heard, &#8220;is it at least capable of being described as important and reliable evidence which would have been bound, or at least likely to have had a material bearing upon, or a material part to play in, the jury&#8217;s determination of a critical issue at the trial?&#8221; The comparison here is with the test for disclosure that is set out in <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span>, para 19. Then there is what may be described as the consequences test, introduced by the words &#8220;it will be open to it to hold&#8221;: &#8220;does a conviction returned in ignorance of the existence of that evidence represent a miscarriage of justice?&#8221; The comparison here is with the test as to whether the trial was fair that is set out in <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span>, para 20.</p>

An alternative reading of it would be to read the words which I have quoted as setting out a threshold test which leads inevitably, if satisfied, to the conclusion that the verdict of the jury, reached in ignorance of the existence of the additional evidence, must be regarded as a miscarriage of justice. On that view it will be enough to show that the test set out in the preceding words has been met. In practice there may be little to choose between these two approaches. For present purposes, however, I think that it is preferable to follow the Lord Justice Clerk&#8217;s approach. It has the merit of giving weight to the words &#8220;it will be open to it to hold&#8221;, which suggest that the court should regard the reference to a &#8220;miscarriage of justice&#8221; in the concluding words of the <span style="font-style:italic">Cameron </span>test as raising a question that ought to be considered separately.</p>

He had already observed at p 262 that setting aside the verdict of a jury was no light matter: see also<span style="font-style:italic"> Megrahi v HM Advocate</span> 2002 JC 99, para 219 where Lord Justice General Cullen repeated this observation in his summary of the <span style="font-style:italic">Cameron </span>test. The availability of a right of appeal based on additional evidence was to be understood against that background. So Lord Justice General Emslie introduced an additional, and quite stringent, consequences test which was not to be found in the words of the statute. It remains the test which the High Court applies in these cases, as the Lord Justice Clerk explained in his opinion 2008 SCCR 407, para 193.</p>

But the statutory formula does not, and never has, provided a definition of what a miscarriage of justice is in law. In his commentary on the Appeal Court&#8217;s decision in 2008 SCCR 407, 465, para 4, Sir Gerald Gordon observed that just what is meant by a miscarriage of justice has always been a problem. In <span style="font-style:italic">R (Mullen) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2004/18" uk:canonical="[2004] UKHL 18" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] UKHL 18</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 AC 1" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 AC 1</ref>, para 9 Lord Bingham of Cornhill said that it is an expression which, although very familiar, has no settled meaning. So the statute leaves it to the court to adapt these words to the circumstances of each case. The formula that was used in <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span>, para 20, was designed to provide a test as to whether, in cases where it is alleged that there was a violation of the appellant&#8217;s article 6 Convention right, the trial was or was not fair. As was pointed out in that paragraph, in <span style="font-style:italic">Kelly v HM Advocate</span> [2005] HCJAC 126, 2006 SCCR 9, para 35 Lady Cosgrove said that, if the trial was found nevertheless to have been fair, there would in consequence have been no miscarriage of justice.

In paras 139-144 he said that the appellant had failed to provide a reasonable explanation of why the evidence of PC Lynch and WPC Clark was not led at the trial, as their names were on the list of witnesses and the defence was not deprived of any opportunity to precognosce them thoroughly about the factual allegations in the indictment. In para 147 he said that he was not persuaded that the recollections of either of them on the point at issue could be regarded as reliable. In para 150 he rejected the argument that the evidence of PC Lynch and WPC Clark was incompatible with the cornerstone of the Crown case as having been based on an incomplete view of the case. If they had given evidence about the presence of the rings in the house on the night of 28-29 April, the advocate depute would not have committed himself to his theory about the cornerstone of the Crown case.</p>

The Lord Justice Clerk&#8217;s acknowledgement at para 150 that, if the evidence of PC Lynch and WPC Clark had been led at the trial the advocate depute would not have committed himself to his theory, makes the point. It is plain that this was information which might materially have weakened the Crown case as presented at the trial, or might materially have strengthened the case for the defence. That was why the Crown, very properly, felt that it ought to have disclosed this material. The situation in this case is quite different from that which will normally arise where the court is presented with an appeal on the ground of fresh evidence. A fresh evidence case usually proceeds on the basis that, while there was nothing wrong with the trial as it was originally conducted, there was nevertheless something missing from it which ought now to be taken into account. Had the material that was missing from this case been disclosed, however, the conduct of the trial by both the Crown and the defence would have quite different.

The fact is that the Crown chose to present the case at the trial in a way that it would not have chosen to do if it had been aware at the time of the trial that there was evidence that the rings were in the house within hours of Arlene&#8217;s disappearance. Nor is it an answer to say that the obligation of disclosure does not extend to precognitions in the possession of the Crown: <span style="font-style:italic">Sinclair v HM Advocate </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/jcpc/2005/3" uk:canonical="[2005] UKPC 3" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] UKPC 3</ref>; 2005 SC (PC) 28, para 28. This is because the evidence as to the presence of the rings in the house on that night had such an obvious bearing on a crucial part of the circumstantial case against the appellant. It does not matter where the material was to be found. It was information that ought to have been given to the defence, and the failure to do this was a breach of the appellant&#8217;s article 6 right. The Crown accepted that this was so when it decided to disclose this material, and in his address to this court the learned Solicitor General did not seek to argue otherwise.</p>

It would also have materially weakened the Crown&#8217;s attack on the appellant that he had no explanation to give for bringing the rings back to the house on 7 May and the theory that he had retrieved them from Arlene&#8217;s dead body. He would not have had to provide an explanation if, as the evidence of PC Lynch and WPC Clark suggested, the rings were in the house all along. Of course, the reliability of their evidence would have been called into question. But so too would the reliability of the evidence for the Crown, including the video that was taken during the police search of the bathroom.</p>

But, as he had already explained at para 150, he had already decided that this was not to be done by judging its effect on the way the Crown presented its case to the jury. At para 161 he concluded that the circumstantial evidence alone was sufficient to entitle the jury to convict. At para 164 he said that the evidence of Hector Dick, if the jury believed it, transformed the Crown case as it made it much more compelling by providing directly incriminating evidence. At para 166 he said that, on his interpretation of the evidence, it was not essential to a conviction that the jury should accept that the appellant left the rings in the bathroom. At para 167 he said that, on that view of the evidence and leaving aside the speech for the Crown and the directions by the trial judge, he could not see how the proposed new evidence could be of such significance as to require the verdict to be set aside. He acknowledged that, although his own view was that the evidence of the return of the rings was not crucial to the Crown case, the effect of the judge&#8217;s direction about the events of 7 May was to make it so. But he said that this direction had the result of enabling the court to conclude with certainty that the jury found that the appellant put the rings in the bathroom on that day.</p>

But the purpose of doing this is to assess the extent to which, having regard to the way the case was conducted by the Crown, the material would have weakened the Crown case or strengthened the case for the defence. It is on the case as presented at the trial that the court must concentrate, rather than the case as it might have been presented. It is not for us to speculate as to what the case might have been, much less how the jury would have reacted to it. What the Crown asks us to do, and what it persuaded the Appeal Court to do, was to consider the case on the basis that the discovery of the rings on 7 May was indicative of the appellant&#8217;s guilt for completely different reasons from those advanced at the trial. In effect we were being asked to deal with the case as if we were a new jury trying the case for the first time. This is not permissible. Our task is quite different but entirely clear. As the Appeal Court said in <span style="font-style:italic">McCreight v H M Advocate </span>[2009] HCJAC 69, 2009 SCCR 743, para 95, it is not the court&#8217;s task to decide what the outcome of the trial would have been if the trial had been conducted on an entirely different basis. We must ask ourselves whether, in the light of the undisclosed evidence, there is a real possibility that the jury at this trial would have arrived at a different verdict.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The proposition that the appellant had returned the rings to the bathroom on 7 May was, as the Advocate Depute said in his address to the jury, the cornerstone of the Crown&#8217;s case. It is clear, in view of the direction that was then given to them by the trial judge, that the jury must have concluded that the appellant put the rings in the bathroom on 7 May. This was the basis for the Crown&#8217;s theory that he had obtained the rings from the deceased&#8217;s dead body and had placed them in the bathroom to create the impression that she had left the matrimonial home with the intention of turning her back on the life that she had had there. This theory would have been undermined by the evidence of PC Lynch and WPC Clark. It would have been challenged by lines of cross-examination of the Crown witnesses that were never developed at the trial, and by questions that were never put to the appellant in chief or in re-examination. The point could have been made that it was improbable that, if the rings were in the bathroom on 28 and 29 April when the police visited the house, the appellant would have removed them and then chosen to return them on 7 May. The theory that he removed them from the dead body would, if the evidence of PC Lynch and WPC Clark were to be accepted, have been untenable. These and other arguments that the defence would have been able to develop would have struck at the heart of the case that the Crown presented. The trial would have been significantly different had the material that was not disclosed been available. There is a real possibility that this would have been sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about the Crown&#8217;s case that the appellant returned the rings to the bathroom on 7 May. If that were so, the jury&#8217;s verdict would be bound in view of the trial judge&#8217;s direction to have been different.</p>

But for that to be achieved the right tests must be applied, so that the appeal too is fair. The conclusion that I would reach as to what these tests lead to leaves us with no alternative but to make the orders which I have proposed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I have read Lord Hope&#8217;s judgment and gratefully adopt his account of the facts and the particular circumstances in which this appeal arises. I recognise, of course, as Lord Hope more than once points out, that there is no appeal against the High Court of Justiciary in Scotland in respect of criminal matters and that this court&#8217;s jurisdiction is limited to consideration of devolution issues only. So far as devolution issues are concerned, however, we have no option but to exercise our jurisdiction and, as again Lord Hope points out, a devolution issue clearly does arise here. Really there can be no doubt that the prosecutor was under a duty to disclose to the defence PC Lynch&#8217;s precognition of 3 July 2002 (stating that he had seen the rings during the night of 28/29 April 1998) as, indeed, the Advocate Depute plainly would have done had he himself been aware of it. On any possible view of the facts, that precognition was material which &#8220;might have materially weakened the Crown case or materially strengthened the case of the defence&#8221; &#8211; see <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes v HM Advocate </span>2010 SLT 266 at paras 19, 28 (and 29) and 39.

(It is, of course, clearly established on the cases that not every article 6 failure to disclose disclosable material automatically results in an unfair trial.) As to this, the test of such unfairness is that now authoritatively laid down by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span> &#8211; in short whether, taking into account all the circumstances of the trial, there is a real possibility that the jury would have arrived at a different verdict had the undisclosed material in fact been disclosed to the defence &#8211; see particularly <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span> at paras 24, 30 and 35.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Is this the same test as the Appeal Court in fact applied here, treating the case as they did as a fresh evidence appeal under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46" uk:canonical="1995 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995</ref> (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1995/46" uk:canonical="1995 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1995 Act</ref>)? To this question there can only be one answer: clearly it is not, for all the reasons given by Lord Hope at paras 27-38 of his judgment. As Lord Hope observes at para 29, it is exclusively a matter for the High Court of Justiciary what test to apply in appeals which do not raise a devolution issue. As, however, that paragraph also suggests, it would be somewhat bizarre to apply different tests in deciding whether or not there has been a miscarriage of justice depending on whether the Appeal Court is concerned with undisclosed material which should have been disclosed (a devolution issue) or with fresh evidence (not a devolution issue). As I indicated in <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span> (at paras 36 and 37), the test, which is ultimately one for the Appeal Court, is logically the same for fresh evidence appeals as for those involving undisclosed statements. Lest it be suggested that undisclosed statements imply fault on the part of the prosecution (arguably, therefore, calling for a lower test to be applied to whether there has been a miscarriage of justice) whereas fresh evidence may not, I would point out that many fresh evidence cases operate at the very least to expose serious flaws in the prosecution evidence &#8211; take, for example, the lying main prosecution witness in <span style="font-style:italic">Dial v State of Trinidad and Tobago</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/jcpc/2005/4" uk:canonical="[2005] UKPC 4" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] UKPC 4</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 WLR 1660" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 WLR 1660</ref> (referred to in para 37 of my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span>) or, indeed, the egregiously deficient expert evidence revealed by the fresh evidence in <span style="font-style:italic">McCreight v HM Advocate </span>2009 SCCR 743 (a decision to which I shall shortly return). Of course, the route by which the court arrives at the question &#8220;has there been a miscarriage of justice?&#8221; differs depending on whether the appeal is brought on undisclosed material or on fresh evidence grounds. As explained in <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span>, the intermediate (article 6) issue arising in any undisclosed material case is: did the non-disclosure make the trial unfair? In a fresh evidence case, by contrast, the appellant must first establish not merely that the fresh evidence is important and reliable but also that there is a reasonable explanation for why it was not adduced at the original trial; only then does the question arise: without it, has there been a miscarriage of justice? Naturally, as Lord Hope points out at para 32, most fresh evidence cases involve no criticism of the original trial proceedings. But ultimately they raise the same question as is raised by the undisclosed material cases. So the <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes </span>test is, I suggest, equally applicable to both.</p>

That statement, however, needs this qualification: in certain rare cases the fresh evidence (or, as the case may be, undisclosed statement) will be of such overwhelming overall import as to make it inappropriate for the Appeal Court simply to add it to the original evidence and ask itself whether the jury might still reasonably have convicted. Instead, in such cases, the Appeal Court will have no alternative but to conclude that there has been a miscarriage of justice, and then decide simply whether or not to order a retrial. Such indeed was the conclusion of the Board in <span style="font-style:italic">Bain v The Queen</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/jcpc/2007/33" uk:canonical="[2007] UKPC 33" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] UKPC 33</ref> (referred to at para 36 of my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span>) given the dramatically different state of the evidence on all the key factual questions in the case at the conclusion of the appeal hearing compared to how they had been presented to the jury at trial.</p>

The victim had died from chloroform and the appellant was convicted specifically on the basis that he had held a chloroformed rag over her face, her death having been caused by the inhalation, not the ingestion, of chloroform. The fresh evidence exposed a thousand-fold error in the reporting of one particular test originally relied upon and, put shortly, established that death by ingestion alone could no longer be excluded. The Appeal Court rejected the Crown&#8217;s case that it mattered not which way the chloroform entered the deceased&#8217;s body and held that, had the fresh evidence been known at the time, the whole trial would have been conducted entirely differently. In such circumstances, said the court: &#8220;It is not our task to decide what the outcome of the trial would have been: in a case such as this, that would involve fruitless speculation.&#8221;</p>

That is to say, the fresh evidence was such that the court could not simply add it to the original evidence and ask itself whether the jury would still have convicted. It was not even such that it could be said that if it had been led at the trial the approach of the Crown would have taken account of it, and that the evidence as a whole would still have led the jury to convict. The case does not depend on the terms of the advocate depute&#8217;s speech or even of the judge&#8217;s charge to the jury. It depends on the more fundamental consideration that the fresh evidence was so overwhelming that it would have affected the whole way in which the trial was conducted. The problem for the Crown was not the approach of the trial depute, but the terms of the indictment, which referred exclusively to inhalation &#8230;. The resultant miscarriage of justice might be described as the failure to provide the accused with a trial based on the true position, and in that situation it seems that the court will not consider what the result of such a trial might have been. That is an extreme situation unlikely to happen very often, and there are also very few cases in which the original expert evidence is so egregious &#8211; or at least one hopes so.&#8221;</p>

Left to myself, however, I should have been inclined to remit the whole matter to that court for reconsideration, leaving it to them to decide, first, whether, in the light of <span style="font-style:italic">McCreight</span>, PC Lynch&#8217;s statement is of such overwhelming significance and would have had so fundamental an impact on the whole course of the trial that it is simply not open to the Appeal Court to decide what the outcome of the trial might have been; secondly, assuming that the Appeal Court concluded that PC Lynch&#8217;s statement was not of such overwhelming significance as that, whether nonetheless, applying the <span style="font-style:italic">McInnes</span> test, there is a real possibility that the jury would have arrived at a different verdict if the withheld material had been disclosed to the defence. In saying that, I am influenced by what I regard as the great strength of the Crown&#8217;s evidence as a whole against the appellant. Indeed, there seems to me force in the Appeal Court&#8217;s own view that the Crown&#8217;s case is logically stronger still in the light of PC Lynch&#8217;s statement than without it.</p>
