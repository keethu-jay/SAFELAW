	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In April 2012 the Supreme Court considered a case called <span style="font-style:italic">Summers v Fairclough Homes Ltd </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2012/26" uk:canonical="[2012] UKSC 26" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] UKSC 26</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 1 WLR 2004" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 1 WLR 2004</ref>, where the facts were strikingly similar to those here. In that case, as in this one, the claimant suffered an injury at work which was caused by the negligence or breach of duty of his employer. In each case the employer was either held liable (in <span style="font-style:italic">Summers</span>) or admitted liability (here) as to 80%, the claimant accepting that he was 20% to blame. In each case the claimant dishonestly exaggerated the extent of the consequences of the injury. In <span style="font-style:italic">Summers </span>the claimant originally claimed damages of over &#163;800,000 but was awarded a total of just over &#163;88,000 on the basis of the true facts, which came to light after undercover surveillance evidence showed that his account of the consequences of his injuries had been grossly and dishonestly exaggerated. In the instant case, the claimant, Mr Colin Hayward, claimed &#163;419,316.59 (exclusive of promotion prospects but discounted for loss of ill health pension). He was ultimately awarded &#163;14,720 after a trial before His Honour Judge Moloney QC (&#8220;the judge&#8221;). The reason for the reduction was again partly as a result of undercover surveillance and other evidence that showed that Mr Hayward&#8217;s claim had been grossly and dishonestly exaggerated.</p>

The agreement was made shortly before the issue of quantum was due to be tried and was incorporated in a Tomlin Order. The employer&#8217;s case was conducted on its behalf by its liability insurer, Zurich Insurance Company Plc (&#8220;Zurich&#8221;), which is the appellant in this appeal. The employer (in practice Zurich) agreed to pay &#163;134,973.11, inclusive of CRU of &#163;22,473.11, in full and final settlement of Mr Hayward&#8217;s claim.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In February 2009 Zurich commenced the present proceedings against Mr<span style="font-family:Arial"/>Hayward claiming damages for deceit. Zurich pleaded that both written statements made by Mr Hayward or on his behalf, and his statements of case in the Particulars of Claim and the Schedule(s) of Loss as to the extent of his injury, as well as his accounts given to the medical experts, constituted fraudulent misrepresentations. Damages were claimed equivalent to the difference between the amount of the settlement and the damages that should have been awarded if he had told the truth. The claim was subsequently amended to claim in the alternative rescission of the settlement agreement and the repayment of the sums paid under it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">No point has been taken in reliance upon the fact that the action was brought in the name of Zurich rather than the employer. Mr<span style="font-family:Arial"/>Hayward applied to strike out the proceedings, or for summary judgment in his favour. He contended that the Tomlin Order created an estoppel per rem judicatam and/or by record, alternatively that the action was an abuse of the process because the issue of fraud had been compromised by the settlement. Deputy District Judge Bosman refused to strike out the claim, although he directed Zurich to amend the claim to seek an order that the compromise be set aside rather than an order for damages. Although it was pleaded in the original defence to Zurich&#8217;s claim that Zurich must satisfy the test in <span style="font-style:italic">Ladd v Marshall</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1954] 1 WLR 1489" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1954">[1954] 1 WLR 1489</ref>, that contention was not ultimately pursued following the hearing before the DDJ.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Zurich appealed to the Court of Appeal (Maurice Kay, Smith and Moore-Bick LJJ) and the decision of the Deputy District Judge was unanimously restored: see <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2011/641" uk:canonical="[2011] EWCA Civ 641" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWCA Civ 641</ref>. It was held that the settlement gave rise to no estoppel of any kind and that the action was not an abuse of process. It was further held that the fact that Zurich had alleged deliberate exaggeration prior to the settlement did not preclude them from relying on it subsequently as a ground for rescission. In the result, the claim proceeded. I note in passing that Moore-Bick LJ said at para 58:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The trial came before the judge in the Cambridge County Court in November 2012. He heard evidence for Zurich from Zurich&#8217;s solicitor (Ms Winterbottom) and its claims manager (Mr Birkenshaw), who were responsible for the conduct of the litigation, from Mr and Mrs Cox and from Mr Sharp, who was the orthopaedic expert instructed on behalf of Zurich. Mr Hayward gave evidence together with three members of his family and also called evidence from Mr Varley, who was the orthopaedic surgeon instructed on his behalf.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Mr Hayward denied any suggestion that his condition was anything other than genuine or that there was any element of exaggeration. He maintained throughout that he was a seriously disabled individual whose disability arose from the original accident and was such that, ever since, he had not been able to work or carry out normal activities of daily living without assistance. As with the first series of witness statements, Mr Hayward signed the appropriate statements of truth setting out in detail the extent of his disability and presented himself to the medical experts on that basis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Following a four-day trial, the judge found that Mr Hayward had deliberately and dishonestly exaggerated the effects of his injury throughout the court process. Of Ms Winterbottom and Mr Birkenshaw, the judge said (at para 2.6 of his judgment quoted in full below) both that: &#8220;[n]either can be said to have believed the representations complained of to be true&#8221; and that &#8220;[t]hey may not themselves have believed the representations to be true; but they did believe that they would be put before the court as true, and that there was a real risk that the court would accept them in whole or part and consequently make a larger award than Zurich would otherwise have considered appropriate&#8221;. The judge further found that, although Zurich was aware at the time of the settlement of the real possibility of fraud, Mr Hayward had continued his deliberate misrepresentations even after the disclosure of the 1999 video, and that those continuing misrepresentations influenced Zurich into agreeing a higher level of settlement than it would otherwise have done. The judge therefore set aside the compromise.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It followed that the issue of quantum in the original action remained to be tried. That issue was heard on 6 September 2013 and, having found that Mr<span style="font-family:Arial"/>Hayward had made a full recovery from any continuing physical disability by October 1999, the judge thereafter handed down a judgment awarding Mr Hayward damages in the modest sum of &#163;14,720, which was about 10% of the settlement figure. An order was made in the later action directing him to repay the sum paid under the settlement less that amount, namely &#163;97,780, interest of &#163;34,379.45 and &#163;3,951 adjustment for CRU.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;Lastly, of course, it is necessary that the employer/Zurich should <span style="font-style:italic">rely</span> on the representations and suffer loss as a result. Here an interesting (and apparently unresolved) question of principle arises. In the ordinary case, sale of goods for example, reliance by the purchaser is effectively equivalent to his <span style="font-style:italic">belief in the truth</span> of the statement; if he believes the goods are as represented, he will be relying on the representation (and acting on it by his purchase) and if not, not. In the litigation context the position is different. In such a situation, the party to whom the representation is made is by no means likely to believe it to be true at the pre-trial stage. At the very least, statements made in the course of litigation will be viewed with healthy scepticism and weighed against the other material available. Often the other party will not be sure, even then, whether the statement is in fact true, and will mainly concern himself with how likely it is to be accepted by the court. Sometimes (a staged road traffic &#8216;accident&#8217; for example) the other party may actually be certain from his own direct knowledge that the statement is a deliberate lie. But even then he and his advisers cannot choose to ignore it; they must still take into account the risk that it will be believed by the judge at trial. This situation is quite different from a proposed purchase, where if in doubt one can simply walk away. For these reasons, <span style="font-family:Arial">it </span>appears to me that the many dicta relied on by CH, to the effect that liability requires that the representation must be believed by the other party, are not applicable to a case like the present. The formulation adopted by the editors of Clerk and Lindsell, 20th ed (2010), at 18-34 fits the case better; &#8216;The claimant must have been <span style="font-style:italic">influenced</span> by the misrepresentation&#8217; (my emphasis).&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;I heard the evidence of Ms Winterbottom and Mr Birkinshaw respectively in 2003 Zurich&#8217;s litigation solicitor and claims handler. Each was aware of the 1999 video and of the real possibility that this was a fraudulent claim. Each was frustrated by the reluctance of &#8216;their&#8217; expert, Mr Sharp, to produce a clear supplemental report saying that he now believed CH to have been shamming and to have sustained far less harm than was being claimed. Neither can be said to have believed the representations complained of to be true. But, if the law is as stated at 2.5 above, this does not matter provided the representations <span style="font-style:italic">influenced</span> them in their decision how much to pay CH in settlement. I am in no doubt that they did. They may not themselves have believed the representations to be true; but they did believe that they would be put before the court as true, and that there was a real risk that the court would accept them in whole or part and consequently make a larger award than Zurich would otherwise have considered appropriate. Acting in reliance on <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> belief (which, whether or not CH was truthful or honest, was the belief he and his advisers must have wanted them to form on the basis of the statements) they made the payment into court which led to the Tomlin Order settlement.&#8221;</p>

It is accepted that there was here an injury leading to a measure of pain and disability, at least up to 2002; and Mr Sharp and Mr Varley do not exclude some continuing pain (as opposed to disability) in the period after the settlement. That being so, the records of pain management and analgesic drug treatment which gave me concern are not irreconcilable with Zurich&#8217;s case.</p>

In this case, the evidence, summarised above, that CH was not in fact suffering from the level of pain and disability that he claimed is so strong that it prevails over his innocent explanations. The probability is, and I so find, that CH was experiencing some pain both before and after the settlement, and did want it treated and managed; but at the same time, he also wanted the maximum compensation he could obtain, and to get it he was dishonestly willing to exaggerate his symptoms to the doctors, and to conceal his real level of ability from them and from the world, so as to give the false impression that he was not capable of heavy work when in fact he was. He must have been aware by the time of the 14 October 1999 surveillance video (at the latest) that his physical abilities were considerably greater than he thereafter represented to the doctors and his employers&#8217; representatives, and I find that his representations made after that date were knowingly false and misleading.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Subject to one point, the ingredients of a claim for deceit based upon an alleged fraudulent misrepresentation are not in dispute. It must be shown that the defendant made a materially false representation which was intended to, and did, induce the representee to act to its detriment. To my mind it is not necessary, as a matter of law, to prove that the representee believed that the representation was true. In my opinion there is no clear authority to the contrary. However, that is not to say that the representee&#8217;s state of mind may not be relevant to the issue of inducement. Indeed, it may be very relevant. For example, if the representee does not believe that the representation is true, he may have serious difficulty in establishing that he was induced to enter into the contract or that he has suffered loss as a result. The judge makes this point clearly and accurately in the third sentence of para 2.5 of his admirable judgment.</p>

It is this. A person in the position of the employer or its insurer may have suspicions as to whether the representation is true. It may even be strongly of the view that it is not true. However, the question in a case like this is not what view the employer or its insurer takes but what view the court may take in due course. This is just such a case, as the judge correctly perceived. As he put it, the employer and its advisers must take into account the possibility that Mr Hayward would be believed by the judge at the trial. That is because the views of the judge will determine the amount of damages awarded.</p>

We now know that he was thoroughly dishonest from October 1999 and that he continued to make false claims in the witness box at the trial even when the evidence against him was overwhelming. Each case of course depends upon its own facts but it seems to me to be putting the case too high to say, as Briggs LJ does at para 30, that Zurich went so far as to plead that Mr Hayward was fraudulent and to support it by a statement of truth. He says this at para 31:</p>

Thus, once he discovers the truth, he must elect whether to rescind or to proceed with the contract. It must follow that, if he already knows or perceives the truth by the time of the contract, he elects to proceed by entering into it, and cannot later seek rescission merely because he later obtains better evidence of that which he already believed, still less if he merely repents of it. This seems to me to be <span style="font-style:italic">a fortiori </span>the case where, as here, the misrepresentation consists of a disputed claim in litigation, and the contract settles that claim.&#8221;</p>

The defendant relies on the medical reports of Mr Sharp dated 11 June 2000, 20 August 2000 and 26 November 2000. The view of the claimant&#8217;s ongoing physical condition from Mr Bracegirdle relied on by the claimant is not accepted by the defendant. As a result of video surveillance obtained Mr Sharp formed the view that the claimant&#8217;s disability was not as great as he had described and he was capable of working full time even if not with heavy lifting. In view of the claimant&#8217;s lack of candour in relation to his physical condition it is not possible to accept that his depressive state, as described, has been consistent, is continuing or will continue into the future.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">These pleas show that Zurich was suspicious of Mr Hayward but no very clear allegations were, or could be, made. However, it is not in dispute that Zurich did as much as it reasonably could to investigate the position before the settlement. The evidence was not as good from its point of view as it might have hoped but the fact is that Zurich did not know the extent of Mr Hayward&#8217;s misrepresentations. The case was settled at a time when the only difference between the experts was the likely duration of future loss. The figure agreed was about half way between the respective opinions of the experts. It was not until the advent of Mr and Mrs Cox that Zurich realised the true position. Hence, as the judge expressly found, the amount of the settlement was very much greater than it would have been but for the fraudulent misrepresentations made by Mr Hayward. The small amount ultimately awarded by the judge, which is not challenged, shows the extent of the dishonest nature of the claim. I am not persuaded that the importance of encouraging settlement, which I entirely agree is considerable, is sufficient to allow Mr Hayward to retain moneys which he only obtained by fraud.</p>

Otherwise, the doubting representee would be placed in a worse position than the gullible or trusting one. Given that misgivings and suspicion might be more likely to arise where there is fraud, it would be perverse for the prospects of redress to be extinguished on account of those very doubts. Of all representees, it may be thought the defrauded representee (whether believing or not) should be the most deserving of protection.</p>

For a misstatement to be the basis for a claim to rescind a contract, the claimant must have given some credit to its truth, and been induced into making the contract by a perception that it was true rather than false. Where judges and text-book writers have used the word &#8216;influenced&#8217; as the touchstone for reliance they have done so in order to allow for belief in the truth of the misrepresentation to be a contributory rather than sole cause of the representee&#8217;s entry into the contract: see for example Clerk and Lindsell on Torts (21st ed) para 18-35. They have not thereby intended to allow in any case where the representee can show that he was influenced into making the contract by the mere making of a representation which he did not believe was true.&#8221;</p>

As I see it, the representee&#8217;s reasonable belief as to whether the misrepresentation is true cannot be a necessary ingredient of the test, because the representee may well settle on the basis that, at any rate in a context such as the present, he thinks that the representation will be believed by the judge. But it is centrally relevant to the question of inducement and causation. Logically, the representee is more likely to settle for a different reason other than the representation, if his reasonable belief is that it is false. One of the extraneous factors in this case, for example, was the fact that the insurers&#8217; expert Mr Sharp had failed to produce, in their view, a report which set out the extent of the misrepresentations with sufficient clarity - see para 15 above.</p>

It seems to me that there may be circumstances in which a representee may know that the representation is false but nevertheless may be held to rely upon the misrepresentation as a matter of fact.</p>

Now as then, they present a serious problem. Personal injury claims usually fall to be met by insurers and the ultimate cost is borne by other policy holders through increased premiums.</p>

To pursue an allegation of fraud without strong evidence is risky. If in such circumstances insurers settle a claim, not in the belief that it is bona fide but in the belief that it is likely to succeed, and if afterwards they discover evidence which proves that the claim was fraudulent, can they bring proceedings to set aside the agreement and recover damages for deceit? In this case the judge at first instance said yes, but the Court of Appeal said no, because in such circumstances the insurers were not deceived. The question which court gave the right answer is important, both for insurers and for those who advise personal injury claimants.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Briggs LJ&#8217;s reasoning was short and direct. He held that for a misstatement to be the basis for a claim to rescind a contract, the claimant must have given some credit to its truth and have been induced into making the contract by a perception that it was true rather than false. He said that when judges and text-book writers used the word &#8220;influenced&#8221; as the touchstone for reliance, they did so in order to accommodate cases where belief in the truth of the statement was a contributory rather than the sole cause of the representee&#8217;s entry into the contract.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Underhill LJ&#8217;s reasoning was somewhat different but led him to the same place. His starting point was that when a person enters into a contract to settle a dispute he knowingly takes the risk of making a payment for a claim which may be ill-founded, and he pays a sum commensurate with his assessment of that risk. But he said that the risk which a settlor must be taken to have accepted will depend on the circumstances of the case. A settlor will not normally be taken to have accepted the risk that the claimant&#8217;s case is not just ill-founded but dishonest. However, if it is sufficiently apparent that the settlor intended to settle notwithstanding the possibility that the claim was fraudulent, he will be held to the settlement. The fact that the insurers had pleaded that the claim was exaggerated for financial gain proved their awareness of the possibility of fraud, but they chose to settle the claim with that awareness, and it was contrary to the public interest in the settlement of disputes for them to be allowed to set aside the settlement.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Underhill LJ was conscious that the logic of this reasoning was that Mr Hayward&#8217;s application to strike out the insurers&#8217; action ought to have succeeded, contrary to the Court of Appeal&#8217;s earlier decision. He described it as a &#8220;debatable point&#8221; whether that decision precluded him from deciding the case on the reasoning which he thought should apply, but he considered that it was possible to re-cast his reasoning in a form which was perhaps less satisfactory, but which avoided conflict with the earlier decision. He held that although in one sense the misrepresentations operated on the mind of the insurers, that did not constitute reliance in the relevant sense. In deciding whether to settle, the insurers formed their own independent judgment whether the claim was likely to succeed, and there was no &#8220;relationship of reliance&#8221; of the kind which was required for the insurers&#8217; action to succeed. Ultimately, therefore, he allowed the appeal on substantially the same ground as Briggs LJ.</p>

It is essential to show that the defendant&#8217;s false representation caused the claimant to act to its detriment. It stands to reason that this should be so. The vice of the defendant&#8217;s conduct consists in dishonestly making a false representation with the intention of influencing the representee to act on it to its detriment. If it does not cause the representee to do so, the mischief against which the tort provides protection will not have occurred.

The plaintiff, an elderly solicitor wishing to retire, advertised for someone to enter into partnership with him and to buy his house. The defendant responded to the advertisement and negotiations followed, in which the plaintiff stated that the practice brought him in about &#163;300 a year. In fact it did not bring in anything like that amount. The parties entered into partnership and into a separate contract for the sale of the house, which made no reference to the business. The defendant paid a deposit and was let into possession. On discovering that the practice was not worth what the plaintiff had said, the defendant gave up possession and refused to complete the purchase. It was therefore a classic case of a purchaser who claimed to have entered into the contract in reliance on the truth of a misrepresentation by the seller. The plaintiff sued for specific performance; the defendant counterclaimed for rescission of the contract and damages for deceit. The plaintiff succeeded at first instance before Fry J, who was not satisfied that the defendant had proved that he relied on the misrepresentation. The Court of Appeal upheld the dismissal of the defendant&#8217;s counterclaim in deceit on the ground that he had not sufficiently pleaded or proved dishonesty, but it allowed his appeal on the issue of rescission on the ground that the facts gave rise to an inference that he was induced to enter into the contract by the plaintiff&#8217;s misrepresentation.

The plaintiff claimed damages for deceit through having been induced to buy shares in an iron company by false representations in a prospectus as to the output of the iron works. The House of Lords held that his claim failed because the critical words of the prospectus were ambiguous, and the plaintiff had failed to show that he understood them in a sense which was false.

If the representor succeeds in his object of influencing the representee to act on the representation to its detriment, there will be the concurrence of fraud and deceit in the representor and resulting damage to the representee.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">That inducement is a question of fact, necessary to establish causation in all cases but not necessarily in the same way, was recognised and well expressed in the decision of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales in <span style="font-style:italic">Gipps v Gipps</span>[1978] 1 NSWLR 454. A woman sued her former husband for deceit in relation to a property settlement which they had entered into at the time of their divorce. They were joint shareholders in a private company and as part of the settlement the wife transferred her shares to the husband. The shares were valued by an independent accountant, but the husband dishonestly contrived to see that the valuation was a substantial undervaluation. The wife did not trust the husband and suspected that the shares were worth more than the valuation, but she did not know the extent of the undervaluation. It was submitted on the husband&#8217;s behalf that if a representee knows that a representation is false in a material particular, as a matter of law he or she cannot sue in respect of it. The court rejected that argument.</p>

No doubt pre-contractual knowledge that the statement made is not wholly true has a very direct bearing on the resolution of this question of fact but it does not of itself necessarily provide the answer. To say that it does is to formulate a different question.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">To state that a person is induced by a statement is to affirm a causal relation which is a question of fact, not of law. That being so, it is impossible to apply to any situation a rule which produces a final result. The trial judge or jury have to answer the question: Did the misrepresentation cause the representee to enter into the contract, it being understood that the representation, as was stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Australian Steel and Mining Corpn Pty Ltd v Corben</span> [1974] 2 NWLR 202, 207, &#8216;was among the factors which induced the contract.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

He added that &#8220;As regards inducement, this is a question of fact&#8221; and that &#8220;The word &#8220;reliance&#8221; used by the judge has a similar meaning but is not the correct criterion.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I agree with His Honour Judge Moloney QC&#8217;s analysis in para 2.5 of his judgment. The question whether there has been inducement is a question of fact which goes to the issue of causation. The way in which a fraudulent misrepresentation may cause the representee to act to his detriment will depend on the circumstances. He rightly focused on the particular circumstances of the present case. Mr Hayward&#8217;s deceitful conduct was intended to influence the mind of the insurers, not necessarily by causing them to believe him, but by causing them to value his litigation claim more highly than it was worth if the true facts had been disclosed, because the value of a claim for insurers&#8217; purposes is that which the court is likely put on it. He achieved his dishonest purpose and thereby induced them to act to their detriment by paying almost ten times more than they would have paid but for his dishonesty. It does not lie in his mouth in those circumstances to say that they should have taken the case to trial, and it would not accord with justice or public policy for the law to put the insurers in a worse position as regards setting aside the settlement than they would have been in, if the case had proceeded to trial and had been decided in accordance with the corrupted medical evidence as it then was.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It was expressly conceded on behalf of the insurers for the purposes of the present appeal that whenever and however a legal claim is settled, a party seeking to set aside the settlement for fraud must prove the fraud by evidence which it could not have obtained by due diligence at the time of the settlement. It makes no difference to the outcome of the present case and the court heard no argument about whether the concession was correct. Any opinion on the subject would therefore be obiter, and since the court has not considered the relevant authorities (including Commonwealth authorities such as <span style="font-style:italic">Toubia v Schwenke</span>[2002] NSWCA 34) or academic writing, it is better to say nothing about it.</p>
