	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is a common assumption that young people of succeeding generations become increasingly sophisticated and worldly-wise. Certainly, the young people of today have access to a range of external experiences, particularly through social media, that would have been inconceivable even 20 years ago. But the street urchins of Dickens&#8217; day were, arguably, just as knowing vis-&#224;-vis their elders, as are today&#8217;s youth. The seeming sophistication or worldliness of today&#8217;s children does not mean that they are not as inherently immature as have been children throughout the ages. Apparent social sophistication is not to be equated with a lack of naivet&#233;. Giving the appearance of being older than their years should not be confused with possession of mature judgment. Protection of our children from the consequences of their immaturity and the preservation of their innocence are just as vital as they have ever been.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The young man who is the appellant in this case is now 18 years old. He was born on 16 July 1996. On 23 and 26 July 2010 two newspapers, the Derry Journal and the Derry News respectively, published an image of him. He was at that time barely 14 years old. These photographs had been published by the newspapers at the request of the police. The publication of the appellant&#8217;s photographs and those of others who had been involved in public disorder in Londonderry was part of a police campaign known as &#8220;Operation Exposure&#8221; which was designed to counteract sectarian rioting at what are called &#8220;interface areas&#8221; in parts of Derry. Interface areas are situated at the boundaries of parts of the city which are predominantly inhabited by one or other of the two main communities.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Mr McGleenan QC, counsel for the Chief Constable, has described the factual background as &#8220;convoluted&#8221; and that is certainly not an exaggeration. The case made on the appellant&#8217;s behalf in the judicial review proceedings, by which he sought to challenge the legality of the police operation, was made largely through affidavits from his father. On 14 July 2010 the Derry Journal had published images of closed circuit television (CCTV) pictures which had been taken during serious rioting in Derry in July 2010. In the first of his affidavits, the appellant&#8217;s father claimed that these included images of his son. He also claimed that leaflets published and distributed by police on 16 August 2010 which again contained CCTV images of young people involved in rioting identified the appellant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">When the application for leave to apply for judicial review was first heard, two particular images from the 14 July issue of the Derry Journal and the leaflets were stated by his counsel to be those of the appellant. It was later established that, not only were these not images of the appellant, he did not appear at all in that particular issue of the newspaper or in the leaflets.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The appellant had been interviewed by police on 1 July 2010. He was questioned about his involvement in rioting on 24 May 2010 and 8 June 2010. He was shown CCTV footage of both incidents and he claimed to be able to identify himself from the footage of both incidents. He was also shown a booklet of some 115 photographs of persons involved in rioting on various dates in May and June 2010. These included the images contained in the leaflets which were later published by police on 16 August 2010. The appellant did not identify himself in any of these images.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In light of the statement by counsel for the appellant at the leave hearing that the appellant&#8217;s image did appear in one of the photographs contained in the leaflet, he was interviewed again in relation to the incident portrayed in that photograph. During this second interview the appellant and his father were shown CCTV footage. As a result of this viewing, both concluded that, contrary to what had been said on his behalf at the application for leave to apply for judicial review, the appellant was not depicted in the image in the leaflet which had formerly been chosen as having identified him. So far as the image in the Derry Journal of 14 July 2010 was concerned, it was established that this was of someone else entirely. In sum, in neither of the particular images which counsel had told the court were of the appellant, was he in fact portrayed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Following the second interview, a further affidavit was prepared for the appellant&#8217;s father. It is claimed that this affidavit has been filed in the proceedings. Apparently, it has never been sworn, so it seems unlikely that it has actually been filed. In any event, in this affidavit, it was claimed that the appellant&#8217;s image appeared in issues of the Derry Journal and the Derry News published on 23 and 26 July 2010 respectively. Both issues contained the same photograph. The appellant&#8217;s father stated that the image came from video footage of an incident which he believed had occurred on 6 June 2010. It is now accepted by the respondent that the appellant is the figure shown in the photograph reproduced in these two issues of the newspapers but the appellant&#8217;s image was captured on 5 June rather than the sixth as the appellant&#8217;s father believed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The appellant&#8217;s father also claimed in this second affidavit that, during the interview on 1 July 2010, his son had identified himself as the child throwing stones in the photograph that was published in the Derry Journal and the Derry News on 23 and 26 July 2010. This is disputed by the respondent. In affidavits filed on his behalf, the interviewing officer has said that, although CCTV footage of events on 5 June had not been shown during the interview on 1 July 2010, the appellant and his father were shown the image later reproduced in the newspapers on 23 and 26 July but the appellant had not been identified at that stage. Indeed, formal identification of the appellant was not made as the person shown in the photograph published on those dates until 11 May 2011. By that time, the six month limitation period that applies to any charge that might have been preferred against the appellant had elapsed. Accordingly, no action was taken against him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The appellant was involved in offences other than those relating to the publication of his photograph. On 6 August 2009 he was arrested on a charge of riotous behaviour which had occurred on 13 July 2009 at Butcher&#8217;s Gate, Derry. This was dealt with by a restorative caution on 29 June 2011. He was also charged with two separate offences of riotous behaviour alleged to have occurred on 6 June and 8 June 2010 and with possession of an offensive weapon and attempted criminal damage on the latter date. A youth conference was directed by Public Prosecution Service on 16 December 2010. The appellant failed to engage with this and on 31 May 2011 it was decided that he should be prosecuted for these offences. The riotous behaviour charges were dealt with by a youth conference ordered by the court on 23 October 2012. The possession of offensive weapon and attempted criminal damage charges were not proceeded with.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Chief Inspector Chris Yates is the area commander of Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) for the Foyle District of Londonderry. He has described how interface violence between the two communities in this district was a regular occurrence during periods of heightened tension such as when parades were taking place. The number of incidents of violence decreased significantly during the period from 2006 to early 2009. But in the early part of 2009 it was observed that the number of such incidents at one particular location, the Bishop Street/Fountain estate interface, had increased substantially. This was of particular concern to the police because there is a residential home for the elderly and vulnerable in the vicinity. Inter-community violence in the area again became a regular occurrence, flaring up significantly during two parades in July and August.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The level of violence increased yet again during May and June 2010. It was more serious and prolonged than any experienced by Mr Yates since he had begun service in the Foyle district. Intelligence received by police suggested that vigilante groups were being formed on one side and dissident republicans were encouraging violence on the other side. Community representatives on the nationalist side informed police that they had lost influence over the youths in their area; indeed they had been confronted on occasions by dissident republican elements. Police officers on the ground reported on the absence of community representatives from either side during the disturbances.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The ongoing violence drained police resources and, in the estimation of Mr Yates, threatened to undermine community confidence in PSNI&#8217;s response. Indeed, police were criticised for having failed to deal with the continuing disorder. The issue was raised at a meeting of the district police partnership on 16 June 2010. This is composed of, among others, local councillors and community representatives. The ongoing violence was discussed at the meeting and general concern was expressed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The matter was discussed again on 1 July 2010 when Chief Inspector Yates was present at a meeting of the City Centre Initiative. This was attended by representatives of various political parties and community groups. Everyone present agreed that the violence at the interface had to be brought to an end. The chief inspector informed those present that the young people engaged in the recent public disorder had to be identified in order to ensure an effective response to the interface violence. He produced a booklet of photographs and asked all who were present to inspect these and to help him identify those captured in the images. He said that if the persons involved were not identified at the meeting or at later private meetings which he offered to hold with any of the representatives present, he would consider having them published in the local press. None of those depicted in the photographs was identified. The chief inspector was asked to defer placing the images in the newspapers and he agreed to do so for a period of two weeks. In the event, he was not contacted by anyone who had attended the meeting and he proceeded to arrange for the publication of the photographs in the local press.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The final decision as to whether particular images should be released to the press or contained in leaflets to be distributed by the police fell to Temporary Superintendent Sam Donaldson. In an affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent, Mr Donaldson explained how the strategy of seeking public assistance in identifying offenders from still images and CCTV footage had been developed in G police district in 2008 and 2009. (Foyle is in G police district). The strategy had proved to be a particularly effective tool in identifying offenders involved in interface violence and acts of public disorder. What follows in the next six paragraphs is Mr Donaldson&#8217;s account of how the strategy is implemented.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Operation Exposure is a system of investigation of crime which comprises an elaborate series or stages of inquiry. The first stage involves the investigating officer inspecting the details of the individual offence which have been entered on the police database. At the next stage the officer follows what might be described as conventional lines of inquiry. This can include the recording of statements from injured parties and witnesses, the interviews of suspected offenders and, if the state of the evidence justifies it, the preparation of a prosecution file. When part of the criminal inquiry involves taking possession of CCTV or still photographic images, the investigating officer is not automatically entitled to make use of these to pursue the inquiry. He or she is required to ensure that all reasonable steps have been taken to identify a suspect by a less intrusive means. These may include door-to-door inquiries; forensic examination of items of evidence; circulation of details among other police officers; intelligence research; and liaison with other police services including An Garda Siochana.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">When it is clear that all lines of reasonable inquiry have been exhausted, the investigating officer is authorised to request the CCTV unit to develop the best image from the available footage. This is then uploaded to police internal electronic briefing pages in order to facilitate identification of suspects. All serving police officers have access to these pages. As part of the Operation Exposure process, the briefing pages carry photographs of the persons that the police wish to identify, together with details of the incident under investigation. Officers are reminded to speak to the Operation Exposure officer if they are able to identify anyone from the images. Particular attention is paid to the role of neighbourhood officers because of their local knowledge and the greater likelihood of their being able to identify individuals. These officers are regularly briefed and it is the responsibility of the Operation Exposure officer to ensure that this particular line of inquiry has been pursued before proceeding to the next stage.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">If it proves impossible to identify a suspect by internal police procedures, the question of releasing images to outside agencies is considered. The Operation Exposure officer must ensure that all other lines of inquiry have been fully pursued before seeking authorisation to release the images. A senior officer such as Mr Donaldson is briefed on the circumstances of the case, the lines of inquiry which have been pursued and the steps that the investigating officer has taken in relation to the identification of the suspect. The senior officer is also informed about the location of the incident under investigation; the injuries, if any, involved in the suspected offence; the ages of the injured parties and the estimated age of the offender. All of this is recorded in an official journal, together with any queries that may have been raised, for instance, about whether all necessary steps have been taken to identify a suspect by some other means. Consideration of the reasons in favour of and those against the release of a specific image is also recorded. All these steps are prescribed by an Operation Exposure guidance document which is modelled on national guidance issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In accordance with specific provisions in the guidance documents, human rights issues are also considered. The authorising officer requires to be satisfied that not only have all other reasonable lines of inquiry been pursued but that the release of the image will have a positive effect on the investigation. The proportionality of an order for release is also considered &#8211; this involves considering whether it is in the public interest that it be released; the risk to the community should the individual depicted in the image remain unidentified; the frequency of the type of offence involved; and the consequences of it continuing to be committed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Operation Exposure was not specifically designed as a general aid in the investigation of crimes committed by juveniles but where it is clear that the image to be released is that of a young person, particular care is taken and greater weight is given to the potential implications of the release of the image. Inquiry is made as to whether liaison has taken place with the local police officer who has a particular knowledge of young people in his area (the police youth diversion officer). Consideration is given to whether there is a risk to the young person from the community (in other words, whether he or she might be the target for a so-called &#8220;punishment beating&#8221;). The apparent age of the young person is taken into account. Unfortunately, it is the police experience that some young people involved in interface violence may be below the age of criminal responsibility. Where the authorising officer considers that this might be the case, release of the image will not be authorised.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Finally, a decision whether to release the image of a young person will involve consideration of where the best interests of the child lie. The authorising officer addresses this question in terms of whether it would be more beneficial to allow the young person to remain unidentified with the possibility that he or she would continue in the unlawful conduct or that it is better to intervene, in order to protect the young person from the dangers associated with involvement in public disorder. This examination takes place against the background that the preferred choice of the police service is to deal with an offending child in ways that do not involve the criminal justice system. The most common result of a child being identified as having taken part in this type of offending is what are described as &#8220;lower level interventions&#8221; such as parent/guardian involvement or youth diversion opportunities. Mr Donaldson stated that these are &#8220;often the desired, and most appropriate outcome&#8221;.</p>

He described the sectarian violence that had occurred between April and July 2010 at the Fountain Street/Bishop Street interface. In that period there were at least 46 sectarian incidents there and over 100 offences were committed. Approximately 75 young people were involved. Police warnings were issued informing the public that CCTV filming of the disorder would take place. Notwithstanding this, violence at the interface continued unabated.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The inspector then considered whether to seek authorisation for the publication of images of those involved in the disorder. Before applying for this he conducted a risk assessment. This included addressing the risk that young people who were identifiable from the images might be targeted. This was considered to be low but mitigation measures were put in place, involving the obtaining of intelligence on the likelihood of targeting taking place and ensuring that all images published would be accompanied by a caption which referred to the presumption of innocence.</p>

He sought to counteract this by adopting a &#8220;no positive charge policy&#8221;, in other words that there would be a presumption in favour of diversion away from sectarianism and crime rather than prosecution. Highlighting the use of engagement procedures whereby the police and other agencies engage with the young person was an integral part of the Operation Exposure exercise.</p>

This stipulated that all other means of identifying and tracing the suspect must have been exhausted before images were published. It also required that special care be taken when release of images of suspects under 18 years was being contemplated. The test for disclosure would be more rigorously applied in those instances. Social services should be approached and offered the opportunity to view the images so that release of such images to the media could be kept to a minimum.</p>

Subsequently, in August 2011 that exercise was retrospectively analysed. The results analysis revealed that 102 offences had been committed between 24 May and 30 June 2010. The release of images in July 2010 had resulted in the identification of 37 persons (including the appellant) who had been engaged in interface violence. Of these 37, only five had been charged with criminal offences. The others had been dealt with through the youth diversion or the youth conferencing facility. This was despite the fact that, in Inspector Burrows&#8217; estimation, there was sufficient evidence to charge the young people involved with criminal offences. The reason that he gave for this was that the overarching objective of the exercise was to identify the offenders and help them to divert from the type of offending that they had been engaged in.</p>

Separate, that is, from the claim that supplying photographs of the appellant to the newspaper for publication was a breach of his article 8 rights. Unsurprisingly, the respondent objected to this new ground of challenge. The question of the legality of retaining the images (as opposed to publishing them) had not been considered by the Divisional Court because that court had not been addressed on the issue. Indeed, Morgan LCJ at para 22 of his judgment had said this about the nature of the application with which the court was dealing:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.50in">&#8220;The answer to the question whether a private life right exists in a public setting will be found by considering whether the person had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the public circumstances in which he placed or found himself. In this case the applicant placed himself in public view among a crowd of other persons engaged, allegedly, in public disorder. He was open to public view by anyone who happened to be watching, be they police or civilians. He took the risk of his presence and any activities being observed and noted down or otherwise recorded. What was the aspect of his private life which was in issue at that stage? None has been ventured. There must be an onus on the applicant to establish the aspect of his private life which he states is engaged at that stage or to characterise the interest which he seeks to protect. As in <span style="font-style:italic">Kinloch</span> there can have been no expectation of privacy in the circumstances of the instant case. The criminal nature of his activities or his presence, (if that is what they are), are not aspects of his life which he is entitled to keep private. Such activities should never be an aspect of private life for the purposes of article 8. In my view a criminal act is far removed from the values which article 8 was designed to protect, rather the contrary. In this case the applicant was photographed by the police, rather than his presence or activities simply noted down. I do not consider that is a material distinction. The photograph is probably a more accurate record of what is on-going. In my view the taking of the photographs of the claimant, in the particular circumstances of this case, did not amount to a failure to respect any aspect of the claimant&#8217;s private life within article 8(1).&#8221;</p>

Alternatively, she suggested that, at best, reasonable expectation was a factor to be taken into account.

And the potential scope of application of the provision must vary according, not only to the conditions in which it is invoked, but also to the circumstances of the individual concerned. The concept of a reasonable expectation of a right to privacy, connoting, as it might seem to some, the notion that the individual concerned actually expected that his or her personal circumstances, on the occasion of the invasion of that privacy, ought to have been protected, and that that expectation was reasonable, is one to be approached with some caution, in my opinion, particularly in the case of children.</p>

It is for this reason that files gathered by security services on a particular individual fall within the scope of article 8, even where the information has not been gathered by any intrusive or covert method. The court has referred in this context to the Council of Europe's Convention of January 28, 1981 for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data, which came into force on October 1, 1985 and whose purpose is: &#8216;[T]o secure in the territory of each Party for every individual ... respect for his rights and fundamental freedoms, and in particular his right to privacy, with regard to automatic processing of personal data relating to him.&#8217; Such data being defined as &#8216;any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual&#8217;.&#8221;(emphasis supplied)</p>

Other factors such as the use to which a photograph might be put or whether the individual concerned has objections to its publication are also relevant. Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">Reklos v Greece</span>(2009) 27 BHRC 420, photographs taken of a day-old infant constituted a breach of his article 8 rights because his parents objected to the taking of his photograph.

Admittedly, the photographs simply showed a face-on portrait of the baby and did not show the applicants&#8217; son in a state that could be regarded as degrading, or in general as capable of infringing his personality rights. However, the key issue in the present case is not the nature, harmless or otherwise, of the applicants&#8217; son&#8217;s representation on the offending photographs, but the fact that the photographer kept them without the applicants&#8217; consent. The baby&#8217;s image was thus retained in the hands of the photographer in an identifiable form with the possibility of subsequent use against the wishes of the person concerned and/or his parents (see, mutatis mutandis<span style="font-style:italic">, PG and JH v The United Kingdom </span>46 EHRR 1272, para 57).&#8221;</p>

Revenue police compiled a file on her containing, among other things, her photographs and fingerprints. A public prosecutor held a press conference in which the allegations against the applicant and others were discussed. Photographs from the police file were supplied to newspapers.

Criminological research into labelling processes has provided evidence of the detrimental effects (of different kinds) resulting from the permanent identification of young persons as &#8216;delinquent&#8217; or &#8216;criminal&#8217;. Rule 8 stresses the importance of protecting the juvenile from the adverse effects that may result from the publication in the mass media of information about the case (for example the names of young offenders, alleged or convicted).

The ambit of article 8 of ECHR must be seen as including within its embrace the need to protect a child from exposure as a criminal. That it should apply to the publication of a photograph of a child while, apparently, engaged in criminal activity, must follow inexorably.

In appropriate circumstances, this will be of considerable importance and its application to those circumstances may lead to only one possible conclusion such as, for instance, an adult person engaging in crime in a public forum. Such a person could not have a reasonable expectation of privacy for his criminal activity. As in <span style="font-style:italic">Kinloch </span>he could not expect that police would not be entitled to carry out surveillance of his criminal behaviour. That consideration may occupy a position of such importance in the question of whether particular circumstances come within the ambit of article 8, that no other factor could outweigh it. But it is important to understand that reasonable expectation of privacy, as a test of whether article 8 is engaged, cannot be accorded a status of unique importance with that automatic consequence in every conceivable circumstance where it can be said that a reasonable expectation of privacy was not present.</p>

If reasonable expectation of privacy was to be treated as the be all and end all of whether article 8 was engaged, it might be supposed that only one answer was possible. For the reasons that I have given, a more nuanced approach is warranted. The fact that the appellant was a child; the fact that the mooted interference with his article 8 right involved not only the taking of his photograph but also its publication, with the consequent risk of stigmatisation; and the fact that the consent of the appellant and his parents was neither sought nor given, combine to more than offset the importance of the reasonable expectation of privacy test in his case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The test for whether article 8 is engaged is, essentially, a contextual one, involving not merely an examination of what it was reasonable for the person who asserts the right to expect, but also a myriad of other possible factors such as the age of the person involved; whether he or she has consented to publication; whether the publication is likely to criminalise or stigmatise the individual concerned; the context in which the activity portrayed in the publication took place; the use to which the published material is to be put; and any other circumstance peculiar to the particular conditions in which publication is proposed. To elevate reasonable expectation of privacy to a position of unique and inviolable influence is to exclude all such factors from consideration and I cannot accept that this is a proper approach. As I have said, reasonable expectation of privacy will often be a factor of considerable weight; it might even be described as &#8220;a rule of thumb&#8221; but to make it an inflexible, wholly determinative test is, in my opinion, to fundamentally misunderstand the proper approach to the application of article 8 and to unwarrantably proscribe the breadth of its possible scope.</p>

It is true that in para 51 of its judgment (quoted by Lord Toulson in para 84) the court referred to the reasonable expectation of privacy <span style="font-style:italic">but this was for the purpose of making clear that where there was such an expectation, that was a factor in favour of the engagement of article 8</span>. The court did <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>suggest that, if there was no reasonable expectation of privacy, that would be determinative of the issue. Indeed, it did not even address that question. Moreover, the court&#8217;s discussion in para 52 about the Commission&#8217;s reference to the use to which photographs might be put was quite separate from the question of whether a there was a reasonable expectation of privacy. It is clear that the Commission (and the court) considered that the dissemination of photographs to the general public could alone give rise to interference with the article 8 right, irrespective of whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy. That approach is plainly inconsistent with the view that, unless there was such an expectation, there could never be an interference with article 8 rights.</p>

Neither stated in terms that if a reasonable expectation of privacy was not present, there could never be an interference with personal autonomy. True it is that Lord Nicholls referred to reasonable expectation of privacy as the touchstone of private life but that is a far cry from saying that this is an indispensable criterion for the engagement of article 8. It is to be remembered that <span style="font-style:italic">Campbell </span>was a breach of confidence case. Such a case is more likely to give rise to consideration of what it was reasonable for the person who claimed that his or her article 8 rights had been infringed to expect. Moreover, too much can easily be read into the use of the word, &#8220;touchstone&#8221;. Understood, as I suggest it should be, as an expression connoting no more than a means by which the significance of the material to be assessed is considered or as a form of litmus test, the mistake of treating it as an obligatory condition is revealed.</p>

Rather, it commends an examination of all the circumstances of the case in order to determine whether such an expectation can be said to exist. This approach is echoed in the judgments of Lord Clarke and Lord Toulson in the present case. As I understand those judgments, it is suggested that considerations such as the age of the child, the circumstances in which the avowed interference took place, the purpose of the publication of photographs and whether consent had been obtained are relevant only in so far as they may be said to conduce to the overarching &#8220;touchstone&#8221; of a reasonable expectation of privacy. The reason for adopting such an approach is not explained other than by reference to earlier authority which, in turn, does not contain any analysis of why reasonable expectation of privacy should be given such unique and overweening status. There is certainly no obviously logical reason for approaching the question of engagement of article 8 in this way. The factors outlined earlier are unquestionably <span style="font-style:italic">capable</span> of bearing on the issue on a freestanding, autonomous footing and, absent any rational basis for treating them merely as a sub-set of reasonable expectation of privacy, this is how they should be evaluated.</p>

More importantly, it relied on Strasbourg decisions prior to <span style="font-style:italic">S v United Kingdom</span> which, as already explained, have to be re-assessed in the light of the judgment in that case; and it was based on a test of &#8216;reasonable expectation of privacy&#8217; which, as the recent Strasbourg cases show, is not the only or determinative factor.

As it happens, and unsurprisingly, the patent lack of any reasonable expectation of privacy in that case was a weighty factor which militated strongly against a finding that article 8 was engaged but nothing in Lord Hope&#8217;s judgment in that case lends support to the notion that that factor must in all circumstances be present for engagement of the article to arise. The criminalisation of a child&#8217;s activities and his possible stigmatisation by publishing photographs of him while apparently engaged in such activities are factors which were not in play in <span style="font-style:italic">Kinloch</span>. But they are distinctly in play in this case. Surveillance was the complained of activity in <span style="font-style:italic">Kinloch</span>; here it is the publication of photographs of the appellant which is in issue. That publication was, for reasons that I shall discuss below, justified. But it is extremely important not to conflate the question of justification with the issue of whether article 8 is engaged. It is wrong, in my judgment, to draw from cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Kinloch</span> the notion that, because the occasion of possible interference involves the recording of what appears to be criminal activity, the subsequent use of that material can never engage article 8.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.50in">&#8220;In one sense [the reasonable expectation of privacy] test might be thought to be circular. It begs the question what is the &#8220;privacy&#8221; which may be the subject of a reasonable expectation. Given the expanded concept of private life in the jurisprudence of the Convention, the test cannot be limited to cases where a person can be said to have a reasonable expectation about the privacy of his home or personal communications. It must extend to every occasion on which a person has a reasonable expectation that there will be no interference with the broader right of personal autonomy recognised in the case law of the Strasbourg court. This is consistent with the recognition that there may be some matters about which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, notwithstanding that they occur in public and are patent to all the world. In this context mere observation cannot, save perhaps in extreme circumstances, engage article 8, but the systematic retention of information may do.&#8221;</p>

It would be facile to say that, because he was rioting, he cannot have expected that a right to respect for private life would be engaged and, on that account alone, it was not engaged. A child&#8217;s need for protection can go beyond what, if he was an adult, he would be reasonably entitled to expect.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The importance of detecting and prosecuting criminal offenders, the prevention of future crime and the diversion of young people from criminal activity are self-evidently objectives of the first order of importance. In concrete terms in this case, dealing with sectarian violence at interfaces in Derry, which showed alarming signs of persistence and escalation, was obviously a pressing police and community priority. This was reflected in the concerns expressed by community leaders in the meetings referred to in paras 13 and 14 above. There is no question therefore that the objective of Operation Exposure was sufficiently important to justify an interference with the article 8 right.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">One must concentrate, therefore, on the three remaining questions to be answered, as outlined in Lord Wilson&#8217;s and Lord Reed&#8217;s analysis. First, is Operation Exposure rationally connected to the objective that it sought to achieve? A number of possible options were available to police as to how to deal with the sectarian violence that was taking place in 2009 and 2010. In his affidavit, Inspector Burrows explained why arresting individuals involved in rioting at the Fountain Street interface was extremely difficult. These reasons have not been challenged. In short summary, they were that police in full riot gear could easily be outrun by young rioters who would descend a grassy slope into the Bogside area of Derry as soon as any arrest operation at the scene was attempted. Pursuing them into this area and attempting to carry out arrests was almost certain to bring about further disorder and community disaffection. Deciding to identify young rioters after the rioting had ended and either prosecuting them or securing their co-operation on diversionary alternatives had an obviously rational connection with the objective of detecting crime, preventing further disorder and diverting young people from criminal activity. The rational connection between Operation Exposure and its objective is plainly established.</p>

Internal police inquiries were made; community leaders and social services were asked whether they could identify those involved; and it is ironical that the appellant and his father were shown the photograph that was later published. Had they identified the appellant, no publication would have occurred.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Plainly, some means of identifying those involved in the rioting had to be found. Sectarian violence at interfaces in Derry could not be allowed to continue. This not only put at risk vulnerable and elderly people living in the area, as well as the young people involved in the violence themselves. It was corrosive of the good community relations in Derry which so many agencies are trying to promote. I am satisfied that publication of the photographs was, in this instance, truly a measure of last resort. I do not consider that a less intrusive means of achieving the objective of Operation Exposure was feasible. The third condition is satisfied, in my opinion.</p>

The importance of the article 8 right and of the need to protect children and young persons from the risk of criminalisation and stigmatisation have been discussed above. The need for the decision-maker to be guided by the primary consideration of the best interests of the children has also been explained.</p>

The appellant himself stood to gain by the opportunities afforded him to be diverted from the criminal activity in which he had been engaged. It was very much in his long term interests that he should become a law-abiding and useful member of his community.</p>

Quite apart from the deep unpleasantness and, indeed, danger to which those who lived in the area were subjected by these recurring riots, the peril in which they placed inter-community harmony is undeniable. The fact that the Operation was so successful in reducing the number of interface confrontations cannot be left out of account either. For these reasons and for the reasons given by the Lord Chief Justice in para 37 of his judgment, the balance fell firmly on the side of pursuing the option of publication of the appellant&#8217;s photographs and those of others involved. The way in which he and others who were thus identified have been dealt with is testament to the benefit that was available to them by following that course. The benefit to the community is as unquestionable as it is considerable.</p>

The notion of the personal autonomy of every individual marches with the presumption of liberty enjoyed in a free polity: a presumption which consists in the principle that every interference with the freedom of the individual stands in need of objective justification. Applied to the myriad instances recognised in the article 8 jurisprudence, this presumption means that, subject to the qualifications I shall shortly describe, an individual&#8217;s personal autonomy makes him &#8211; should make him &#8211; master of all those facts about his own identity, such as is name, health, sexuality, ethnicity, his own image, of which the cases speak; and also of the &#8220;zone of interaction&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Von Hannover v Germany</span>(2004) 16 BHRC 545 (para 50) between himself and others &#8230;</p>

This cluster of values, summarised as the personal autonomy of every individual and taking concrete form as a presumption against interference with the individual&#8217;s liberty, is a defining characteristic of a free society. We therefore need to preserve it even in little cases. At the same time it is important that this core right protected by article 8, however protean, should not be read so widely that its claims become unreal and unreasonable. For this purpose I think that there are three safeguards, or qualifications. First, the alleged threat or assault to the individual&#8217;s autonomy must (if article 8 is to be engaged) attain &#8220;a certain level of seriousness&#8221;. Secondly, the touchstone for article 8(1)&#8217;s engagement is whether the claimant enjoys on the facts a &#8220;reasonable expectation of privacy&#8221; (in any of the senses of privacy accepted in the cases). Absent such an expectation, there is no relevant interference with personal autonomy. Thirdly, the breadth of article 8(1) may in many instances be greatly curtailed by the scope of the justifications available to the state pursuant to article 8(2). I shall say a little in turn about these three antidotes to the over blown use of article 8.&#8221;</p>

He also warned that courts need to be on guard against using as a touchstone a test which brings into account considerations which should more properly be considered at the later stage of proportionality. Applying <span style="font-style:italic">Campbell&#8217;s</span> case, Sir Anthony Clarke MR said in <span style="font-style:italic">Murray&#8217;s</span> case at para 35 that &#8220;The first question is whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy&#8221;. He said at para 36 that the question is a broad one which takes account of all the circumstances of the case, including the attributes of the claimant, the nature of the activity in which the claimant was involved, the place at which it was happening, and the nature and purpose of the intrusion. The principled reason for the &#8220;touchstone&#8221; is that it focuses on the sensibilities of a reasonable person in the position of the person who is the subject of the conduct complained about in considering whether the conduct falls within the sphere of article 8. If there could be no reasonable expectation of privacy, or legitimate expectation of protection, it is hard to see how there could nevertheless be a lack of respect for their article 8 rights.</p>

It may be that the court had in mind that a person may have a reasonable but mistaken expectation of privacy. Be that as it may, I have difficulty in reading the court as meaning to suggest that a situation may come within the scope of article 8 even where the person concerned had no reasonable expectation of privacy, and it is difficult to see why that should be so. It is perhaps unfortunate that the point was not developed, but the case pre-dated <span style="font-style:italic">Von Hannover</span>, where the court referred to a &#8220;legitimate expectation&#8221; of protection, and the succeeding line of domestic authorities (including three decisions of the House of Lords or Supreme Court), which have adopted and applied the reasonable expectation test.</p>

There is no difficulty is seeing that the applicant had a legitimate expectation that the police would not make use of her photograph in that way, but it is a very different question whether a member of a crowd engaged in a violent disturbance in a public place has a legitimate expectation of protection from the police seeking the help of the public to identify those involved.

Ultimately it will be a matter of judgment for the court with every case depending upon its own facts. The point that needs to be emphasised is that the assessment of the impact of the taking and the subsequent publication of the photograph on the child cannot be limited by whether the child was physically aware of the photograph being taken or published or personally affected by it. The court can attribute to the child reasonable expectations about his private life based on matters such as how it has in fact been conducted by those responsible for his welfare and upbringing.&#8221;</p>

The reasonable or legitimate expectation test is an objective test. It is to be applied broadly, taking account of all the circumstances of the case (as Sir Anthony Clarke said in <span style="font-style:italic">Murray&#8217;s</span> case) and having regard to underlying value or values to be protected. Thus, for example, the publication of a photograph of a young person acting in a criminal manner for the purpose of enabling the police to discover his identity may not fall within the scope of the protection of personal autonomy which is the purpose of article 8, but the publication of the same photograph for another purpose might. Nor am I persuaded by Lord Kerr&#8217;s reading of <span style="font-style:italic">Von Hannover</span> (in para 57 of his judgment) that the Commission and the court treated dissemination to the general public as a self-standing test.</p>

The expression &#8220;reasonable expectation of privacy&#8221; is found in a number of English cases. I agree with Lord Toulson that the two expressions have the same meaning.

In one sense this test might be thought to be circular. It begs the question what is the &#8216;privacy&#8217; which may be the subject of a reasonable expectation. Given the expanded concept of private life in the jurisprudence of the Convention, the test cannot be limited to cases where a person can be said to have a reasonable expectation about the privacy of his home or personal communications. It must extend to every occasion on which a person has a reasonable expectation that there will be no interference with the broader right of personal autonomy recognised in the case law of the Strasbourg court. This is consistent with the recognition that there may be some matters about which there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, notwithstanding that they occur in public and are patent to all the world. In this context mere observation cannot, save perhaps in extreme circumstances, engage article 8, but the systematic retention of information may do.&#8221;</p>

But that was plainly not the specific test applied by the Strasbourg court in <span style="font-style:italic">S v United Kingdom</span>; and the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">PG v United Kingdom</span> [<ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2008) 46 EHRR 51" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">(2008) 46 EHRR 51</ref>] makes clear at para 57, that it is not the only test and that other considerations come into play, in particular, in relation to the retention of personal data &#8230;.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is true that in <span style="font-style:italic">S</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">v United Kingdom </span>the court does not expressly refer to the reasonable expectation of privacy but its analysis seems to me to be consistent with it. It is also true that in <span style="font-style:italic">PG </span>the court said at para 57 that a person&#8217;s expectations may be a significant, although not necessarily a conclusive, factor. I cannot at present think of a situation where article 8.1 would be engaged in the absence of a reasonable expectation of privacy or a reasonable expectation of protection and respect for the private life of the applicant. It is difficult to see why article 8.1 should be engaged where the applicant has no reasonable expectation of privacy. It is important in this respect to have regard to the fact that the concept of reasonable expectation is a broad objective concept and that the court is not concerned with the subjective expectation of the person concerned, whether that person is a child or an adult.</p>

Although, in the light of the present state of the Strasbourg jurisprudence, I for my part would not go so far as to say that such a case is impossible, the test of reasonable expectation is in my opinion relevant in this class of case.</p>

In para 90 he sets out the facts and relies upon paras 19 to 21 of Lord Hope&#8217;s judgment in this court. The complaint was that the form of surveillance and the use of the resulting evidence involved a breach of the applicant&#8217;s article 8 rights. Lord Hope said:</p>

There is a zone of interaction with others, even in a public context, which may fall within the scope of private life: <span style="font-style:italic">PG v United Kingdom</span>, &#8230;, para 56. But measures effected in a public place outside the person&#8217;s home or private premises will not, without more, be regarded as interfering with his right to respect for his private life. Occasions when a person knowingly or intentionally involves himself in activities which may be recorded or reported in public, in circumstances where he does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, will fall into that category: <span style="font-style:italic">PG v United Kingdom</span>, para 57 &#8230;</p>

I think that the answer to it is to be found by considering whether the appellant had a reasonable expectation of privacy while he was in public view as he moved between his car and the block of flats where he lived and engaged in his other activities that day in places that were open to the public. &#8230; The criminal nature of what he was doing, if that is what it was found to be, was not an aspect of his private life that he was entitled to keep private.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I agree with Lord Toulson that on the facts here the criminal nature of what the appellant was doing was not an aspect of his private life that he was entitled to keep private. He could not have had an objectively reasonable expectation that such photographs, taken for the limited purpose of identifying who he was, would not be published. I would not however hold that the mere fact that a person is photographed in the course of a criminal activity deprives him or her from the right to prevent the police from publishing the photographs. Thus, if the photographs had been published for some reason other than identification, the position would have been different and might well have engaged his rights to respect for his private life within article 8.1. I would not therefore put the point quite as broadly as Lord Hope does in para 21 of <span style="font-style:italic">Kinloch</span> quoted above<span style="font-style:italic">.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I respectfully differ from Lord Kerr in so far as he distinguishes the position of a child. I adhere to the views I expressed in <span style="font-style:italic">Murray&#8217;s </span>case to which Lord Toulson refers at paras 88, 96 and 98. As ever, all depends upon the circumstances of the case and, in the case of a child, the context is of particular importance. So, for example, the attributes of the child, the nature of the activity in which he or she was involved, the place where the activity was happening and the nature and purpose of the intrusion complained of are all relevant factors. I do not think that any of the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights to which we were referred leads to any other conclusion, although I accept that it does not always refer to the reasonable expectation point.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">As Lord Toulson says at para 96, in <span style="font-style:italic">Murray </span>the Court of Appeal (comprising Laws, Thomas LJJ and myself) approved the approach of Patten J at first instance so far as a child is concerned. I remain of that view today. All the factors identified by Patten J as quoted by Lord Toulson are relevant or potentially relevant in considering whether article 8.1 is engaged in a particular case. Thus I agree with Lord Toulson at para 98 that the age of the person involved, the presence or absence of consent to publication, the context of the activity and the use to which the relevant material is put are all relevant. The law is to be applied broadly, taking account of all the circumstances of the case. In Lord Steyn&#8217;s famous phrase, in law context is everything.</p>

I reach that conclusion having regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the fact that the appellant was 14 at the material time.</p>
