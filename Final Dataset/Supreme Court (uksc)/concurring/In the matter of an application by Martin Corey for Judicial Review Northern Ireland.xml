	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 3 December 1973, the appellant, Martin Corey, was convicted of the murder of two police officers. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. He remained in prison until 26 June 1992 when the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland released him on licence, pursuant to section 23(1) of the Prison Act (Northern Ireland) 1953.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Following his release in 1992 the appellant remained at liberty for almost 18 years. On 13 April 2010 the Secretary of State wrote to the parole commissioners referring Mr Corey&#8217;s case to them under article 9(1) of the Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order 2001 (SI 2001/2564 (NI 2)) and seeking a recommendation on whether the licence on which appellant had been released should be revoked.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 14 April 2010, a single commissioner recommended that the licence of Mr Corey should be revoked. That recommendation was based on material which had been supplied by the Secretary of State. The material included a confidential file containing intelligence information which had been provided by the security services. After that recommendation had been received, a minister of state, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, revoked the appellant&#8217;s licence on 15 April 2010. Mr Corey was taken into custody again on 16 April 2010 and has remained in prison since then.</p>

After he had been recalled to prison, therefore, Mr Corey&#8217;s case was duly referred. Initially it was considered by a single commissioner. She gave provisional directions under the Parole Commissioners&#8217; Rules (Northern Ireland) 2009 (SRNI 2009/82). Part of the material which had been supplied to the commissioners in April 2010 had been certified as confidential information under rule 9(1) of the 2009 Rules. And rule 9(3) requires that a gist of such information should be served on the commissioners and the prisoner.</p>

In compliance with rule 9(3) it was accompanied by a statement of evidence which set out the gist of the confidential information. This was considered by the single commissioner. She also examined the confidential material itself. She recommended, pursuant to rule 19, that the Advocate General for Northern Ireland should appoint a special advocate to represent Mr Corey&#8217;s interests. The commissioner also recommended that the appellant&#8217;s case should be dealt with by a panel of commissioners, rather than by a single commissioner considering it alone. A panel was duly convened.</p>

The panel heard submissions on behalf of the Secretary of State. The special advocate also made representations to the panel about the adequacy of the disclosure of the closed material. The commissioners gave a ruling on these submissions on 7 February 2011. Hearings before the panel were then conducted into Mr Corey&#8217;s case. These took place between 29 and 31 March and 23/24 May 2011. Open and closed evidence was received. Counsel appeared for Mr Corey and the Secretary of State at the open hearings. The special advocate represented the appellant&#8217;s interests during closed hearings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 15 August 2011 the panel gave its decision. This comprised both a closed and an open judgment. In a detailed ruling which formed part of the open judgment, the panel stated that it was satisfied that Mr Corey had become involved in the Continuity Irish Republican Army from early 2005 and that he was in a position of leadership in that organisation from 2008 until his recall to prison. It was concluded that the appellant posed a risk of serious harm to the public at the time of his recall.</p>

Since the commissioners were not so satisfied in relation to Mr Corey, they refused to direct his release.</p>

The Secretary of State was a notice party to the application for judicial review.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In a judgment delivered on 9 July 2012, Treacy J held that the commissioners&#8217; decision was indeed based solely or decisively on the closed material. He further found that the allegations contained in the open material were not sufficiently specific to enable the appellant to provide his lawyers and the special advocate with information to refute them. The hearing which the commissioners had conducted into the appellant&#8217;s case constituted, on that account, a breach of the appellant&#8217;s &#8220;right to procedural fairness&#8221; under article 5(4) of the Convention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Instead of quashing the decision of the commissioners, however, Treacy J decided, pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/23/section/21" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 21</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/23" uk:canonical="1978 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Judicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978</ref>, to remit the matter to them with a direction that they reconsider the case and reach a decision in accordance with his ruling. The judge also decided to admit the appellant to bail pending reconsideration of his case by the parole commissioners. The Secretary of State immediately applied for a stay of Treacy J&#8217;s order and within a short time thereafter lodged an appeal against the judge&#8217;s decision. Although the commissioners also lodged an appeal, this was not pursued and they participated as a notice party in the appeal proceedings brought by the Secretary of State.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Court of Appeal convened an early hearing to consider that part of the judge&#8217;s order by which he had directed the appellant&#8217;s release. On 11 July 2012 it decided that the judge did not have power to grant bail. The Court of Appeal therefore stayed enforcement of that part of Treacy J&#8217;s order which had admitted the appellant to bail. Delivering the judgment of the court, Morgan LCJ said that the determining issue was whether there had been &#8220;a break between the sentence [of life imprisonment] and the continued detention of the [appellant]&#8221; (para 8). Since there was no such break, the judge did not have power to grant bail.</p>

Permission to appeal was granted on 13 December 2012. In the meantime, the appeal by the Secretary of State against that part of Treacy J&#8217;s decision in relation to the breach of article 5(4) (which had been deferred in July 2012) was heard by the Court of Appeal on 26 October and 26 November 2012. In a judgment delivered on 21 December 2012 the appeal was allowed: [2012] NICA 57. The Court of Appeal concluded that the material provided to the appellant and his advisers was sufficient to allow him to give effective instructions to those representing him. There was therefore no breach of article 5(4) of the Convention.</p>

That application was refused. In these circumstances, the appellant&#8217;s appeal on the question whether the High Court had an inherent jurisdiction to grant him bail or otherwise order his interim release is, strictly speaking, academic. Because of the importance of the issue, however, this court considered that the appellant&#8217;s appeal on this question should be allowed to proceed.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Quinlivan QC made three principal arguments on behalf of the appellant. Firstly, she submitted that, when determining a judicial review challenge to the commissioners&#8217; refusal to release a recalled prisoner, the High Court had power to order the discharge of the prisoner as part of its inherent jurisdiction. Secondly, she argued that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/42" uk:canonical="1998 c. 42" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Human Rights Act 1998</ref> afforded an applicant whose Convention rights were found to have been violated the right to an effective remedy. Where breach of the appellant&#8217;s article 5(4) rights had occurred, the effective remedy for that breach must include entitlement to be admitted to bail. Finally, she contended that the continued detention of the appellant some two years and three months after revocation of his licence, without there having been an article 5(4) compliant hearing at which the legal propriety of his detention was reviewed, amounted to a breach of article 5(1) of the Convention; alternatively, his continued detention was arbitrary. In either event, the High Court had power to direct that the appellant should be released.</p>

Nor had it been &#8211; at least in the terms in which it is now made &#8211; advanced to the Court of Appeal. Article 5(1) of the Convention, in its material part, provides that &#8220;Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law: (a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court &#8230;&#8221; For the first time before this court, Ms Quinlivan sought to argue that the delay in holding an article 5(4) compliant inquiry into the appellant&#8217;s detention had rendered that detention unlawful.</p>

Separate High Courts for Northern Ireland and the remainder of the island of Ireland (later to become the Republic of Ireland) were brought into existence. They continued to function in much the same way as previously but as separate entities. In Northern Ireland a new Supreme Court of Judicature was created by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/23" uk:canonical="1978 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Judicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978</ref>.

In particular, the general jurisdiction of the High Court was preserved. Section 16(2)(a) provided that all such jurisdiction as was capable of being exercised previously by the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland would continue to be exercisable. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the Northern Ireland High Court has an inherent jurisdiction.</p>

On the latter aspect, Sir Jack said that &#8220;the essential character of a superior court of law necessarily involves that it should be invested with a power to maintain its authority and to prevent its process being obstructed and abused&#8221;.</p>

Ultimately, however, these are geared to the same aim <span style="font-style:italic">viz</span> ensuring the effective delivery and enforcement of the court&#8217;s decisions. Approached in that way, the issue in the present case can be expressed thus: &#8216;Is it necessary for the effective disposal of the appellant&#8217;s claim that the court should have power to order his release pending reconsideration of his case by the commissioners?&#8217;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The fact that the release of life sentence prisoners is governed by the 2001 Order does not, per se, inhibit the exercise of an inherent jurisdiction. As Sir Jack Jacob put it, at p 24, &#8220;the court may exercise its inherent jurisdiction even in respect of matters which are regulated by statute&#8221;. But he added an important rider. Recourse to an inherent jurisdiction, he said, must not contravene any statutory provision. One may go further, however. Using an inherent jurisdiction in a way that runs counter to the purpose or spirit of legislation is not permissible. The present case exemplifies the point. It could not be right to purport to exercise an inherent jurisdiction in a way that would undermine the intended operation of the statute. And therefore to direct the release of a recalled prisoner where the statutory safeguards surrounding a decision to restore liberty to such a prisoner are not in place could not be justified by invoking the inherent jurisdiction.</p>

The focus of the appellant&#8217;s challenge was to the commissioners&#8217; failure to direct his immediate release and the manner in which their determination was made. The appellants had not made a substantive challenge to the lawfulness of his detention under article 5(1) of the Convention. As the judge said in para 58 of his judgment:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The decision to grant bail in the present case was not founded, therefore, on the conclusion that the appellant&#8217;s detention was unlawful. The judge did not address that issue. He based his decision on the manner in which the commissioners&#8217; review of the appellant&#8217;s case had been conducted. The claim that the court had inherent jurisdiction to order his release must be viewed against that backdrop. The same applies to the claim that the finding of a breach of article 5(4), to be practical and effective, required that the court should be able to order the appellant&#8217;s release. Put shortly, the critical question is whether it was necessary that, in order to give meaningful and realistic effect to the finding that the review into the appellant&#8217;s detention had not been conducted lawfully, the court should have power to order the appellant&#8217;s release.</p>

His order that the review of the appellant&#8217;s detention had not been conducted lawfully and that it should be reconsidered was, on its own terms, a full vindication of the right which the appellant had asserted. On that ground alone, I consider that the judge did not have power to order the appellant&#8217;s release. That conclusion makes it unnecessary to deal with the submission made on behalf of the appellant that the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Ex parte Blyth</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1944] KB 532" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1944">[1944] KB 532</ref>, that the High Court did not have jurisdiction to grant bail post conviction, should not be followed.</p>

His application for judicial review was subsequently dismissed and the judge, considering that he had no further jurisdiction in the matter, refused bail pending an appeal. On his appeal against the refusal of bail it was held that, unless there was statutory provision or judicial precedent to the contrary, the High Court seized of a civil matter had jurisdiction to grant bail. In </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#080808">Sezek </span><span style="color:#171717">the applicant, </span><span style="color:#2B2B2B">a </span><span style="color:#171717">Turkish national, had been granted indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom but his </span><span style="color:#2B2B2B">subsequent </span><span style="color:#171717">application for British citizenship had been refused for failing to declare previous criminal convictions. A deportation order was made in April 1999 which included authorisation for his detention. He applied for judicial review of that decision which was dismissed. He appealed the dismissal and applied to the Court of Appeal for bail pending the hearing of his appeal. It was held that the High Court had power in judicial review proceedings to make an ancillary order temporarily releasing on bail an applicant detained pursuant to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1971/77" uk:canonical="1971 c. 77" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Immigration Act 1971</ref>.

It should also be remembered that in <span style="font-style:italic">Sezek </span>the Court of Appeal considered that it was by recourse to an original, as opposed to inherent, jurisdiction, that the grant of bail might be made. All that aside, the principal difficulty with Ms Quinlivan&#8217;s argument is that in both cases the applicants were asserting their right to liberty. If their claims were upheld, they were entitled not to be detained, whereas what Mr Corey claims is the right to have his valid recall to prison reviewed in a way that is compliant with article 5(4) of the Convention. A power to grant bail ancillary to the declaration that the appellant was entitled to that particular form of relief was not only unnecessary in order to make the grant of relief practical and effective, it was unrelated to it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As Mr Simpson QC for the Secretary of State reminded us, the 2001 Order prominently required, in article 3(2), that a miscellany of experts drawn from a variety of fields be appointed to be life sentence commissioners (the predecessors of parole commissioners). That requirement was replicated in later legislation. Under paragraph 1 of Schedule 4 to the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 2008 (SI 2008/1216) the Secretary of State is enjoined to ensure that at least one of the commissioners is a person who holds or has held judicial office; one must be a medical practitioner who is a psychiatrist; one a chartered psychologist; one who has experience of working with victims of crime; and one who has made a study of the causes of delinquency or the treatment of offenders. This requirement reflects the need to have available a range of specialists who can contribute to what must often be a difficult debate as to whether the rigorous test set out in article 6(4)(b) is satisfied. It would be inconsistent with the protection of the public (which is such a central feature of the legislation) that a judge should order the release of a life sentence prisoner by reason only of a failure to conduct an article 5(4) compliant review, where the intense examination, contemplated by article 6(4)(b), of whether his detention is no longer necessary has not taken place. Put simply, the legislature has placed in the hands of a panel of experts the difficult decision as to when a life sentence prisoner should be released. Their role should not be supplanted by a judge who does not have access to the range of information and skills available to the commissioners. In this connection it should be noted that Ms Quinlivan sensibly accepted that, even if the High Court had inherent jurisdiction to release a life sentence prisoner on bail, it should not do so unless satisfied that he would pose no risk of serious harm to the public.</p>

Two months after the Court of Appeal ruling, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) handed down its judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">James v United Kingdom </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2012) 56 EHRR 399" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">(2012) 56 EHRR 399</ref>.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;The court is &#8230; satisfied that in cases concerning indeterminate sentences of imprisonment for the protection of the public, a real opportunity for rehabilitation is a necessary element of any part of the detention which is to be justified solely by reference to public protection. In the case of the IPP sentence, it is in any event clear that the legislation was premised on the understanding that rehabilitative treatment would be made available to those prisoners on whom an IPP sentence was imposed, even if this was not an express objective of the legislation itself. Indeed, this premise formed the basis upon which a breach of the Secretary of State's public law duty was found and confirmed (see paras 31, 104 and 107 above). The court accordingly agrees with the applicants that one of the purposes of their detention was their rehabilitation.&#8221;</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;&#8230; following the expiry of the applicants' tariff periods and until steps were taken to progress them through the prison system with a view to providing them with access to appropriate rehabilitative courses &#8230; their detention was arbitrary and therefore unlawful within the meaning of article 5(1)1 of the Convention.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The arbitrariness (and, on that account, the unlawful nature) of the continued detention stemmed from their detention while the means of bringing it to an end remained elusive for the prisoners. This was not directly related to the question of the causal link between the detention and the original sentence, however. The causal link survived. The sentence was imposed because of the perception that the prisoners posed a threat to the public if released. (The perception was grounded, at least to a certain extent, on a presumption built into the statute but it is unnecessary for present purposes to go into that). Until the risk of danger to the public could be dispelled the causal link with that part of the sentence which required the detention of the prisoner remained intact. It was because there was no means of ascertaining whether the danger had dissipated that the detention had become arbitrary.</p>

Thus, the court said in para 221 that &#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">until steps were taken </span>to progress [the prisoners] through the prison system&#8221; (emphasis added) with a view to enabling them to undertake courses that would reduce or eliminate the danger that they presented and until, thereby, they were able to demonstrate their suitability for release, their detention remained arbitrary.

The original sentence is premised on the existence of a danger to the public which must be extinguished before release is to be ordered. Until that extinguishment can be demonstrated, the reasons for the original sentence (and therefore the causal link) endure. But if one deprives the prisoner of the opportunity to show that the danger no longer obtains the detention is arbitrary, not because the causal link does not continue, but because the prisoner cannot show that the risk on which it is founded is no longer present.</p>

The essential question is whether he has had an opportunity to demonstrate that the reasons that he was considered to present a threat to society no longer apply. If he does not have such an opportunity, then clearly, on the authority of <span style="font-style:italic">James v United Kingdom</span>, his continued detention is arbitrary.

The Court of Appeal&#8217;s judgment dismissing his claim that the review of his detention was not compliant with article 5(4) disposes conclusively of that issue. He has had what has been found to be a fully ample chance to show that he can be safely released. There is, therefore, no question of his continued detention being arbitrary.

What is not completely clear from the judgment is whether, during the period that the detention was unlawful, the prisoners were entitled to be released. Observations made in para 217 of the court&#8217;s judgment are somewhat ambiguous on the question whether release is the automatic consequence of a finding of violation of article 5(1):</p>

The Government have suggested that, in these circumstances, a finding of a violation of article 5(1) as a result of the lack of access to appropriate treatment courses would allow the release of dangerous offenders who had not yet addressed their risk factors. The court accepts that where an indeterminate sentence has been imposed on an individual who was considered by the sentencing court to pose a significant risk to the public at large, it would be regrettable if his release were ordered before that risk could be reduced to a safe level.&#8221;</p>

It is not clear to me whether or not that means that the court thought that article 5(4) had been breached.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The second further issue was raised under article 13 by Mr Wells and Mr Lee, but the court regarded article 5(4) as <span style="font-style:italic">a lex specialis</span> in relation to the more general requirements of article 13, and so dealt with this issue also under article 5(4): para 229. The complaint was that the obstacle under primary legislation to the prisoners&#8217; release until they satisfied the Parole Board that they were no longer a public danger meant that, even if they had succeeded in their challenge to their detention, they would not have had any effective remedy in respect of the violation: para 224. In dealing with this, the court noted that Mr Wells and Mr Lee had been able to commence judicial review proceedings to obtain orders that they be provided with the relevant courses and that their commencement of such proceedings had led to their speedy transfer to first stage prisons for that purpose. Accordingly, they had &#8220;failed to establish that the combination of the Parole Board and judicial review proceedings could not have resulted in an order for their release&#8221; and, so, there had been no violation in this regard: para 232. This reasoning does not explicitly address the further five month delay in actually providing courses which Mr Lee suffered. But the underlying thinking may again be that Mr Lee could have commenced further judicial review proceedings which, in combination with the Parole Board&#8217;s power to release once satisfied that he no longer presented a public danger, constituted an effective remedy.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The court&#8217;s reference in <span style="font-style:italic">James </span>to the detention as &#8220;unlawful&#8221; under article 5(1) during periods when courses were not being duly provided is problematic. It suggests that the circumstance identified in article 5(1)(a) - that is &#8220;the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court&#8221; &#8211; had ceased to exist. If that were so, then logically that implies that the prisoner should have been at once released. In its forensic endeavour to persuade the Strasbourg Court not to find any violation of article 5(1), the United Kingdom Government itself suggested that a finding of such a violation would &#8220;allow [<span style="font-style:italic">logically, require</span>] the release of dangerous offenders who had not yet addressed their risk factors&#8221;: para 217. The court did not face up directly to the logic of this submission, but contented itself with saying that &#8220;it would be regrettable if &#8230;. release were ordered before that risk could be reduced to a safe level&#8221;, adding only that &#8220;However, this does not appear to be the case here&#8221;: para 217.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Although the submissions before the court took this extreme form, which much of the court&#8217;s description of the issues echoed (see paras 175 onwards), I doubt whether it follows axiomatically from the court&#8217;s judgment that a prisoner who was not being given appropriate courses could assert a right to release until such courses became available. The suggestion that this follows would lose its basis, if the court were to be understood as implying into article 5 an ancillary duty on the state to provide the courses which would enable prisoners to progress towards release in accordance with domestic law. That is in substance what the court was doing in, for example, para 206, where it said that &#8220;it would be irrational to have a policy of making release dependent on a prisoner undergoing a treatment course without making reasonable provision for such courses&#8221;.</p>

It is difficult to think that the court would expect prisoners to be released for a period, eg until appropriate first stage prison places and courses were available, and then, by some mechanism, recalled.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Second, there is the way in which the court dealt with Mr Wells&#8217; and Mr Lee&#8217;s complaint that the pre-condition to their release introduced by primary legislation, constituted by the requirement to satisfy the Parole Board that they were no longer a public danger, prevented them having an effective remedy under article 13. The court said nothing to question the legitimacy of this requirement during periods when courses were not available. On the contrary, it recited that &#8220;Pursuant to the 1997 and 2003 Acts, the release of a prisoner sentenced to an IPP could be ordered by the Parole Board, having satisfied itself that the individual was no longer dangerous&#8221;: para 231. It is however true that the court in its further reasoning was only concerned with, and accepted, the effectiveness of the judicial remedy available through the combination of the Parole Board and the judicial review proceedings which Mr Wells and Mr Lee actually took: para 232.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Third, I find significant the court&#8217;s reasoning in rejecting the claims to recover in respect of the violation of article 5(1) any damages over and above sums for distress and frustration: para 244. The court rejected such claims because, it said, it &#8220;cannot be assumed that, if the violations in the present cases had not occurred, the applicants would not have been deprived of their liberty&#8221;: para 244. That reasoning makes good sense, if the obligation to progress prisoners towards courses, which could facilitate their release, was an obligation ancillary to their continued detention. They would not be entitled to release, but they could claim damages for the ancillary and &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; failure to enable them to progress towards release. However, any damages claimed for loss of liberty (as distinct from damages for distress and frustration on account of the delays in providing courses) would depend upon showing that, had they been moved earlier to first stage prisons and given courses sooner, they would in fact have been released sooner. That, the court in effect said, had not been shown, and could not &#8220;be assumed&#8221;: para 244.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This explanation of the court&#8217;s reasoning loses force if the court thought that the prisoners should have been released during any periods when they were not being duly progressed through the prison system. On that basis, the prisoners&#8217; continued detention would simply be illegitimate, and, as such, damages for wrongful detention should follow. It is not normally possible for a public authority, after a wrongful arrest or imprisonment, to argue that, if it had not been guilty of a wrongful arrest or imprisonment, then it could and would have taken different steps which would have achieved a rightful arrest or imprisonment. And, even if such an argument were possible, the onus would surely be on the public authority to show that it could and would have taken those different steps with that result. It would not be sufficient to put the onus on the wrongfully detained prisoners to show that the public authority could not or would not have taken such steps. So the court&#8217;s statement that it &#8220;cannot be assumed&#8221; (para 244) that the prisoners would not anyway have been detained would not have been appropriate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">For these reasons, despite the court&#8217;s description in para 221 of the detention as arbitrary and unlawful under article 5(1), I believe it to be well arguable that what was in truth being identified was a breach of an ancillary obligation to progress the prisoners through the prison system arising by implication from, rather than directly under the terms of, article 5(1). Such a breach would not mean that the prisoners were entitled to be released, but would entitle them to recover any damages which they could show had been suffered as a result of that breach. If this were to be regarded as the correct analysis, then their continuing detention would continue to be legitimate under the Convention as well as under domestic law, until the Parole Board was satisfied that their detention was no longer necessary for the protection of the public.</p>
