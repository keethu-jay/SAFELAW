This is not just privilege for the purposes of the law of defamation but is a true immunity&#8221; - <span style="font-style:italic">Arthur JS Hall &amp; Co v Simons </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 1 AC 615" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 1 AC 615</ref>, 740, per Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough.

The claim in this case relates precisely to such negligence and was, for that reason, struck out by Blake J on 22 January 2010. He certified, however, that the case involved a point of law of general public importance and granted a &#8220;leapfrog certificate&#8221; under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/58/section/12" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1969/58" uk:canonical="1969 c. 58" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Administration of Justice Act 1969</ref>, so that this appeal is brought directly from his decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The narrow issue raised by this appeal is whether the act of preparing a joint witness statement is one in respect of which an expert witness enjoys immunity from suit. Mr Ter Haar QC for the appellant was careful to emphasise at the outset of his submissions that he was not concerned to do more than establish that an expert witness enjoyed no immunity in relation to this activity. Inevitably, however, his submissions have raised the broader issue of whether public policy justifies conferring on an expert witness any immunity from liability in negligence in relation to the performance of his duties in that capacity. Surprisingly, this immunity has never been challenged in the past. It has simply been accepted that an immunity which protects witnesses of fact applies equally to prevent a client from suing in negligence the expert that he has retained.</p>

They are to be treated as true for the purpose of resolving the question of whether this claim was properly struck out. Understandably, the respondent has not suggested that the facts asserted do not disclose a good cause of action if she is susceptible to liability in negligence.</p>

The appellant was stationary on his motorcycle, waiting to turn at a road junction, when he was knocked down by a car driven by a Mr Bennett. Mr Bennett was drunk, he was uninsured and he was driving while disqualified.</p>

These were post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, an adjustment disorder and associated illness behaviour which manifested itself in chronic pain syndrome.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 20 March 2001 the appellant instructed solicitors (&#8220;Kirwans&#8221;) to act for him in personal injury proceedings. Kirwans instructed a consultant orthopaedic surgeon who advised that an opinion from a clinical psychologist would be of help. The respondent is a consultant clinical psychologist. In May 2003 Kirwans instructed her to examine the appellant and prepare a report for the purposes of litigation. She prepared a report dated 29 July 2003 in which she expressed the view, inter alia, that the appellant was at that time suffering from PTSD. Kirwans issued proceedings on 26 September 2003 against Mr Bennett and the Motor Insurance Bureau. The latter was replaced by the relevant insurer (&#8220;Fortis&#8221;). Fortis admitted liability on 17 February 2004, so that only quantum remained in issue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Pursuant to instructions from Kirwans, the respondent carried out a further examination of the appellant and issued a second report dated 10 December 2004. This stated that the appellant did not have all the symptoms to warrant a diagnosis of PTSD, but was still suffering from depression and some of the symptoms of PTSD. A subsequent report prepared by Dr El-Assra, a consultant psychiatrist instructed by Fortis, expressed the view that the appellant was exaggerating his physical symptoms. The district judge ordered the two experts to hold discussions and to prepare a joint statement. The discussion took place on the telephone and Mr El-Assra prepared a draft joint statement, which the respondent signed without amendment or comment.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The joint statement was damaging to the appellant&#8217;s claim. It recorded agreement that his psychological reaction to the accident was no more than an adjustment reaction that did not reach the level of a depressive disorder of PTSD. It further stated that the respondent had found the appellant to be deceptive and deceitful in his reporting, and that the experts agreed that his behaviour was suggestive of &#8220;conscious mechanisms&#8221; that raised doubts as to whether his subjective reporting was genuine.</p>

This dates back over 400 years &#8211; see <span style="font-style:italic">Cutler v Dixon </span>(1585) 4 Co Rep 14b; 76 ER 886. Thus the immunity was established long before the development of the modern law of negligence and, in particular, the recognition of the possibility of liability for negligent misstatement. It also dates back to an era long before it became common for forensic experts to offer their services under contracts for reward. The immunity has its origin in a reaction to an actual or perceived tendency on the part of disgruntled litigants, or defendants in criminal proceedings, to bring proceedings for libel or slander against those who had given evidence against them. Thus the immunity originally took the form of absolute privilege against a claim for defamation and it extended to all who took part in legal proceedings.

A similar protection was afforded to counsel in relation to defamatory allegations made against a party, or indeed anyone else, in the course of his conduct of legal proceedings.

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">The continuous theme that runs through the cases is, in modern parlance, the chilling effect that the risk of claims arising out of conduct in relation to legal proceedings would have. It would make claimants reluctant to resort to litigation. It would make witnesses reluctant to testify. If they did testify, it would make them reluctant to do so freely and frankly. The cases emphasise that the object of the immunity is not to protect those whose conduct is open to criticism, but those who would be subject to unjustified and vexatious claims by disgruntled litigants.</p>

The issue in that case was whether witness immunity extended to protect police officers who were alleged to have fabricated evidence, as opposed to having given false evidence, from claims of conspiracy to injure and misfeasance in public office. The plaintiffs had been indicted for serious offences, but their trial had been permanently stayed on the grounds of abuse of process on the part of the police. Their Lordships identified the following justifications for witness immunity:</p>

He might have added that it only applied where the proceedings had culminated in a decision. In his judgment in this case, Lord Hope suggests that this justification is one that was relevant to barrister immunity, but which is not relevant to witness immunity. I do not wholly agree. A claim against a witness might well involve an assertion that, but for the false evidence, the trial would have had a different outcome, a matter with obvious implications for the measure of damages. I agree, however, that this was not one of the original justifications, nor the most cogent justification, for the general immunity.</p>

The question was raised, but not explored in depth, of whether an expert is normally in direct contractual relationship with his client, or whether his contract is with the solicitor who engages him on behalf of the client. I do not think that this is significant. In either event there is a marked difference between holding the expert witness immune from liability for breach of the duty that he has undertaken to the claimant and granting immunity to a witness of fact from liability against a claim for defamation, or some other tortious claim, where the witness may not have volunteered to give evidence and where he owes no duty to the claimant. It is notable that, before the present case, no one appears to have suggested that this difference called into question whether witness immunity should extend to protect the expert witness against a claim by his own client.</p>

It is a case of unusual facts. The appellant was a doctor of medicine who had been retained by the respondent (&#8220;the wife&#8221;) in respect of proposed proceedings against her husband for separation and aliment. He was subsequently retained by the husband in the same proceedings. In preparing his witness statement he included some very damaging allegations based on matters that he had learned when acting for the wife, which included allegations of taking morphine and planning to procure an abortion. He subsequently gave oral evidence of these matters in the court proceedings. The wife brought an action against him for breach of confidence and for slander, relying on both what was said to the husband&#8217;s lawyers and what was said in court. The head note to the report of the decision in the House of Lords suggests that the claim for breach of confidence did not proceed, and that the relevant issues that came before the House of Lords were whether the appellant was immune from a claim for slander in respect of what he said in court and, more pertinently, whether this immunity extended to what he had said when giving his witness statement (&#8220;the precognition&#8221;). I am however grateful to Lord Hope for his clarification of the nature of this rather confusing litigation. The House of Lords held that the appellant was immune.

In that case the plaintiffs had pursued a disastrous claim against both the supplier and a repairer of a lorry tractor unit. They subsequently sued an engineering expert on the ground that his incompetent report had led them to advance claims on a basis that was invalid, and their solicitors for negligence in engaging an incompetent expert. The expert persuaded the district judge to strike out the claim against him on the ground that he was immune from suit. On appeal the plaintiff did not challenge the proposition that the immunity that was enjoyed by witnesses in general protected a paid expert against a claim by his own client. The issue was the extent of that immunity. Mr Simon Tuckey QC, sitting as a deputy High Court judge, applied by analogy the decision of the House of Lords in relation to the advocate&#8217;s immunity from suit in <span style="font-style:italic">Saif Ali v Sydney Mitchell &amp; Co </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1980] AC 198" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1980">[1980] AC 198</ref> &#8211; a decision that I shall consider in due course.

One of the issues raised in that case was whether witness immunity protected a psychiatrist from liability in negligence to a child in respect of advice as to whether the likelihood of child abuse rendered it desirable for a child to be removed from her home. The argument was that if the psychiatrist&#8217;s views were to lead to child care proceedings, the psychiatrist would have to present those views in court. In the Court of Appeal at p 661 Sir Thomas Bingham MR dismissed this argument. He observed that witness immunity had been treated as analogous to immunity accorded to those in the conduct of proceedings. If the immunity were as wide as that claimed, a barrister or solicitor advising a client on a factual question with a view to proceedings would be immune from an action for negligence. Such a result was inconsistent with authority. Mr Simon Tuckey had reached a correct conclusion in <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer v Durnford Ford</span>. In the House of Lords Lord Browne-Wilkinson disagreed at p 755, inasmuch as he held that the views expressed by the psychiatrist were protected by witness immunity. He found the reasoning of Drake J in <span style="font-style:italic">Evans v London Hospital </span>compelling, at least in relation to criminal proceedings. He expressed no view in relation to &#8220;ordinary civil proceedings&#8221; and said that he intended to cast no doubt on Mr Simon Tuckey&#8217;s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer v Durnford Ford</span>.</p>

The case has features in common with those of the present case. The defendant was a structural engineer, retained by the plaintiffs to assist in a claim against insurers in relation to the costs of dealing with subsidence of the plaintiffs&#8217; house. He initially advised that total underpinning was required at a cost of some &#163;77,000. Subsequently, in the course of preparing a joint report with the insurers&#8217; expert witness, the latter persuaded him to agree that infilling with polystyrene, at a cost of only some &#163;21,000, would be a satisfactory remedy. The case was settled on that basis, but the plaintiffs then brought an action claiming that their expert&#8217;s change of advice had been negligent. The master refused an application to strike out the claim and the judge upheld him, but the Court of Appeal reversed the decision.

His application for permission to appeal included complaints against his counsel. It was refused. He then commenced proceedings for negligence. It was at all stages found that his claim was hopeless. But the issue of principle of whether an action for negligence could be brought against a barrister was pursued to the House of Lords. Their Lordships unanimously held that it could not. Barristers were immune from liability in negligence. This immunity did not stem from a barrister&#8217;s inability to sue for his fees. It was to protect him from the risk of being sued for doing no more than his duty to the court. This would sometimes conflict with what appeared to be the personal interests of the client:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Lord Reid, Lord Morris and Lord Upjohn expressed the view that public policy did not require that a barrister should be immune from negligence in relation to matters unconnected with cases in court. Lord Reid observed at p 229 that immunity was not the only way that the law protected counsel. They also shared with the judge and witnesses the absolute privilege with regard to what was said by them in court. At p 252 Lord Morris compared the immunity of the barrister with that accorded to witnesses in respect of the evidence given by them in court, an immunity which also attached to the parties and to the judge, albeit that the relationship between an advocate and the client differed from the relationship between the client and an adverse witness - p 253. Lord Pearce at pp 268-269 also drew an analogy between the position of advocates and the position of witnesses. He remarked that the reasons underlying the immunity of witnesses were first that there might be a series of retrials and secondly that an honest witness might be deflected by fear of the consequences. He asked at p 270 whether counsel alone of the five ingredients of a trial &#8211; parties, witnesses, judge, jurors and advocate &#8211; should be the only one to be liable to his client in damages. Lord Upjohn at p 283 remarked that it was because of counsel&#8217;s duty to the court in the public interest that immunity from defamation was granted, as it was to the judge and to witnesses. This immunity was just as necessary in respect of his general conduct of the case.</p>

The plaintiff brought an action against his solicitors for failure to sue the correct defendant in relation to a road traffic accident. The solicitors joined the barrister who had advised them. The issue was whether the barrister&#8217;s immunity extended to his advice on whom to sue. The House of Lords, Lord Keith of Kinkel dissenting, held that it did not. Lord Wilberforce at p 214 distinguished this immunity from the privilege that attached to court proceedings, which protected equally judge, counsel, witnesses, jurors and parties, observing that this had nothing to do with a barrister&#8217;s immunity from suit.

He held that this immunity was justified by two considerations. The first was that the barrister&#8217;s immunity for what he said and did in court was part of the general immunity from civil liability which attached to all persons in respect of their participation in proceedings before a court of justice; judges, court officials, witnesses, parties, counsel and solicitors alike &#8211; p 222. The second was the undesirability of re-trials of the same issues. Lord Salmon at p 230 remarked that public policy required the barrister to have the same immunity as the judge, juryman or witness for anything he said or did in court, but not for failing to join the right party. Lord Russell of Killowen, who also dissented, at p 233, on the other hand, said that the barrister&#8217;s immunity was so that he could perform his public duty in relation to the conduct of litigation without worrying about the possibility of a claim for negligence. He did not consider that this immunity was connected with &#8220;a quite different&#8221; immunity of judges, witnesses and jurors.</p>

The alleged cause of action was a statement of the evidence which the witness proposed to give to the court. A witness owes no duty of care to anyone in respect of the evidence he gives to the court.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Lawrence QC for the respondent did not seek to advance the danger of a multiplicity of proceedings in support of witness immunity. He accepted that that argument had been more cogent as a justification for the immunity from suit that had been accorded to advocates, and yet that argument had not prevailed in <span style="font-style:italic">Hall v Simons</span>. Rather, Mr Lawrence invoked the chilling factor that potential liability in negligence would introduce in respect of expert evidence. This, he submitted, would operate in two ways. First it would make expert witnesses more reluctant to provide their services at all. He drew attention to concerns expressed by Thorpe LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Meadow v General Medical Council </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2006/1390" uk:canonical="[2006] EWCA Civ 1390" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWCA Civ 1390</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] QB 462" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] QB 462</ref>, paras 225-249, that, in relation to family justice, the demand for experts exceeded supply and that this was a field which was very sensitive to increasing or newly emerging disincentives. This was a theme that Wall LJ had underlined extra-judicially when delivering a paper on the use of experts in family cases at the annual Bond Solon expert witness conference on 6 November 2009.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Lawrence placed more emphasis on the other aspect of the chilling factor. This was the reluctance that an expert witness would have to give evidence that was contrary to his client&#8217;s interest if there was a risk that this might lead his client to sue him. This risk, he submitted, had become more significant since Lord Woolf, and the provisions of the CPR which gave effect to his recommendations, had emphasised the paramount importance of the duty of an expert to give frank and objective advice to the court. It was important that experts should have the reassurance that, if they complied with this obligation to the possible disadvantage of their clients, they would not be at risk of being sued for failing to have regard to their clients&#8217; best interests.</p>

The expert might be reluctant to do this through fear of conceding that his earlier advice had been erroneous. In that event he needed protection, not in respect of his revised view, but in respect of his earlier advice. Yet, on the approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer v Durnford Ford</span>, the earlier advice might not be covered by the immunity. Mr Lawrence&#8217;s response to this was that any advice given in possible anticipation of litigation should be covered by the immunity. This would bring within the scope of the immunity a wider class of expert advice than those embraced by the test in <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer v Durnford Ford</span>, indeed any expert advice where there was a possibility of litigation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Ter Haar submitted that the case for conferring immunity on expert witnesses has weakened because, in two respects, the immunity of expert witnesses has been eroded. In <span style="font-style:italic">Meadow v General Medical Council </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] QB 462" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] QB 462</ref> the Court of Appeal held that expert witnesses had no immunity against disciplinary proceedings before professional tribunals where fitness to practice was in issue.

Mr Lawrence accepted the validity of this argument to the extent of submitting that <span style="font-style:italic">Phillips v Symes (No 2) </span>had been wrongly decided. I do not consider that the susceptibility of expert witnesses to disciplinary proceedings or to wasted cost orders weakens the case for immunity from civil suit, in so far as this case exists. The principal argument advanced for immunity from civil suit is that the risk of being sued will deter the expert witness from giving full and frank evidence in accordance with his duty to the court when this conflicts with the interests of his client. In so far as a witness may be tempted to trim his sails to suit his client, I would expect the risk of disciplinary proceedings or of a wasted costs order to be a deterrent. The argument advanced in support of immunity from suit by the client does not extend to immunity from disciplinary proceedings or wasted costs orders.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is common ground that if the immunity is to be effective it must apply to views expressed not only in court, but in contemplation of, or at least preparation for, possible court proceedings. The vast proportion of civil claims settle before they get to court. For this reason alone it will be in only a small minority of cases that views expressed by an expert will affect the client because of their impact on a hearing in court. In the vast majority of cases those views will impact, not on a judgment of the court, but on the client&#8217;s decision whether or not to proceed with an action or on the terms on which he agrees to settle the dispute. It is no coincidence that both in the present case and in <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer v Durnford Ford </span>the claim has related to the effect of the expert&#8217;s opinion on the terms of a settlement. Thus the effect of the immunity is to preclude the client from suing for breach of duty where the expert&#8217;s negligence is alleged to have adversely affected such a decision. The question is whether this is necessary in order to ensure that his objectivity is not affected in the minority of cases that do result in court proceedings.</p>

His only duty is to tell the truth. That statement may be true of a witness of fact, but it is not true of an expert witness.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In some circumstances the difference between an immunity from suit and an absence of legal duty can be readily appreciated. Diplomatic immunity, which can be waived, is an example. In this case the distinction is more elusive. There was a time when it might have been possible to argue that there was a difference between the duty owed by an expert witness to the client who retained him and a conflicting, and overriding, public duty owed by the expert when giving evidence in court; that the former obliged the expert to put forward the best case for his client whereas the latter involved a duty to be candid, even at the expense of his client. The existence of such a difference is implicit in the provision of CPR 35.3 which states that it is the duty of experts to help the court with matters within their expertise and that this duty <span style="font-style:italic">overrides</span> any obligation to the person from whom the experts have received their instructions or by whom they are paid. Such a distinction lends force to the argument that, once the expert is providing evidence to the court, or preparing to do so, he is no longer bound by a duty to his client and thus cannot be held liable for breach of such duty.</p>

There is no longer any scope, if indeed there ever was, for contrasting the duty owed by an expert to his client with a different duty to the court, which replaces the former, once the witness gets into court. In response to Lord Woolf&#8217;s recommendations on access to justice the CPR now spell out in detail the duties to which expert witnesses are subject including, where so directed, a duty to meet and, where possible, reach agreement with the expert on the other side. At the end of every expert&#8217;s report the writer has to state that he understands and has complied with his duty to the court. Where an expert witness is retained, it is likely to be, as it was in the present case, on terms that the expert will perform the functions specified in the CPR. The expert agrees with his client that he will perform the duties that he owes to the court. Thus there is no conflict between the duty that the expert owes to his client and the duty that he owes to the court. Furthermore, a term is implied into the contract under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/29/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/29" uk:canonical="1982 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982</ref>, that the expert will exercise reasonable skill and care in carrying out the contractual services.</p>

In each case those services include a paramount duty to the court and the public, which may require the advocate or the witness to act in a way which does not advance the client&#8217;s case. The advocate must disclose to the court authorities that are unfavourable to his client. The expert witness must give his evidence honestly, even if this involves concessions that are contrary to his client&#8217;s interests. The expert witness has far more in common with the advocate than he does with the witness of fact.</p>

I can see no justification for this assumption. All who provide professional services which involve a duty of care are at risk of being sued for breach of that duty. They customarily insure against that risk. In some circumstances the risk of suit and the cost of insurance may be so high that this is a discouragement to provision of those services. I understand that, in some parts of the world, this is true of the services of obstetricians.

It is thus very sensitive to increasing or newly emerging disincentives. This factor is compounded by a paucity of incentives. The fee for the work will often be paid to the trust employer. The employer may be reluctant to release the consultant from other duties. Keeping up with the demands of the court&#8217;s timetable may involve evening or weekend work.&#8221;</p>

I do not consider that much weight can be attached to a survey of this type, but it does not suggest that immunity from suit for negligence is essential to secure an adequate supply of forensic experts.

Research into the position in other common law jurisdictions was inconclusive. As expert witnesses have, to date, had the benefit of immunity, how they will behave if that immunity is removed must be a matter of conjecture or, more accurately, reasoning. But if reasoning is applied, I do not find that it supports Mr Lawrence&#8217;s thesis. An expert&#8217;s initial advice is likely to be for the benefit of his client alone. It is on the basis of that advice that the client is likely to decide whether to proceed with his claim, or the terms on which to settle it. The question then arises of the expert&#8217;s attitude if he subsequently forms the view, or is persuaded by the witness on the other side, that his initial advice was over-optimistic, or that there is some weakness in his client&#8217;s case which he had not appreciated. His duty to the court is frankly to concede his change of view. The witness of integrity will do so. I can readily appreciate the possibility that some experts may not have that integrity. They will be reluctant to admit to the weakness in their client&#8217;s case. They may be reluctant because of loyalty to the client and his team, or because of a disinclination to admit to having erred in the initial opinion. I question, however, whether their reluctance will be because of a fear of being sued &#8211; at least a fear of being sued for the opinion given to the court. An expert will be well aware of his duty to the court and that if he frankly accepts that he has changed his view it will be apparent that he is performing that duty. I do not see why he should be concerned that this will result in his being sued for breach of duty. It is paradoxical to postulate that in order to persuade an expert to perform the duty that he has undertaken to his client it is necessary to give him immunity from liability for breach of that duty.</p>

Yet removal of their immunity has not in my experience resulted in any diminution of the advocate&#8217;s readiness to perform that duty.

The rational expert witness who has performed his duty is unlikely to fear being sued by the rational client. But unsuccessful litigants do not always behave rationally. I can appreciate the apprehension that, if expert witnesses are not immune, they may find themselves the subject of vexatious claims. But again I question the extent to which this apprehension is realistic. It is easy enough for the unsuccessful litigant to allege, if permitted, that a witness of fact who has given evidence against him was guilty of defamatory mendacity. It is far less easy for a lay litigant to mount a credible case that his expert witness has been negligent.</p>

There is nothing vexatious about the present claim. Where, however, a litigant is disaffected because a diligent expert has made concessions that have damaged his case, how is he to get a claim against that expert off the ground? It will not be viable without the support of another expert. Is the rare litigant who has the resources to fund such a claim going to throw money away on proceedings that he will be advised are without merit? The litigant without resources will be unlikely to succeed in persuading lawyers to act on a conditional fee basis. A litigant in person who seeks to bring such a claim without professional support will be unable to plead a coherent case and will be susceptible to a strike out application. For these reasons I doubt whether removal of expert witness immunity will lead to a proliferation of vexatious claims.

It was of course extended to other causes of action, but absolute privilege of witnesses and other persons in the judicial process from defamation is at its core. The basis of the present decision is that where a person has suffered a wrong that person should have a remedy unless there is a sufficiently strong public policy in maintaining an immunity. The policy behind immunity from suit for defamation is that to allow the possibility of such an action would create a chilling effect, inhibit frankness and bring the trial process into disrepute. Thus there is nothing in the present decision which would enable a client to sue his handwriting expert for slander because in the witness box he changed his mind and expressed the view that the client&#8217;s document was a forgery.</p>

This Court is often helped by being referred to authorities from other common law systems, including the United States. It is only in the United States that there has been extensive discussion in the case law of the policy implications of removal of immunity for actions by disappointed clients against their experts. On this appeal the appellant did not rely on the United States material, although it is helpful to his case. The respondent&#8217;s counsel drew attention to some of the United States cases on the basis of research which (it was said) was &#8220;slightly hampered by the renovation of the Middle Temple&#8217;s American room.&#8221; But there is an outstanding collection of United States material in the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies in London University, and (provided the barristers or solicitors concerned are prepared to make the expenditure) all of the material is readily available on line.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present context the American State courts have considered and dealt with precisely the same arguments of policy which have been argued before this court. In the last 20 years several State courts have considered the immunity of retained or so-called &#8220;friendly&#8221; experts, sued by the party which retained them. The respondent&#8217;s counsel suggested that the Court would not derive much assistance from these cases, because (it is said) the culture relating to expert evidence is different in the United States. There are, it is true, many references to the expert (who, of course, will be giving evidence in jury trials) as a &#8220;hired gun&#8221; (e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Blackwell v Wyeth</span>, 971 A 2d 235, 245 (Ct App Md 2009), quoting Judge Weinstein &#8211; &#8220;an expert can be found to testify to the truth of almost any factual theory, no matter how frivolous&#8221;) and there have been well-known concerns about the practice of shopping around for experts and the venality of some of them, and the lack of specific procedural guides to the conduct of experts by contrast with England, where the Woolf reforms have sought to entrench and give teeth to the principle. But the underlying principle is the same: the expert owes a duty to the client, but also owes a duty to the court, as a servant of the court, to present truthful and competent evidence: <span style="font-style:italic">Marrogi v Howard</span>, 805 So 2d 1118, 1132 (La 2002); and cf Federal Rules of Evidence, rules 102, 702.</p>

Apart from a passing reference in a footnote (at p 341, n 27) the Supreme Court did not touch on the subject of expert witnesses. In the United States witness immunity has generally been applied to adverse and court-appointed experts: e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Provencher v Buzzell-Plourde Associates</span>, 711 A 2d 251 (NH 1998); <span style="font-style:italic">Dalton v Miller</span>, 984 P 2d 666 (Colo Ct App 1999); <span style="font-style:italic">McNall v Frus</span>, 784 NE 2d 238 (Ill App Ct 2002).</p>

The rationale of the decisions upholding immunity included these: that absence of immunity would lead to a loss of objectivity, and the threat of civil liability would encourage experts to assert extreme positions favourable to the client; it would run counter to the fundamental reason for expert evidence, which was to assist the court in a matter which was beyond its fact-finding capabilities; there is a need to promote finality of judgments by discouraging endless collateral litigation; and fewer experts would be willing to become involved in litigation if they could later be sued by the party who retained them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The policy reasons in these decisions included these: The reality is that an expert retained by one party is not an unbiased witness, and the threat of liability for negligence may encourage more careful and reliable evaluation of the case by the expert. Consequently, the threat of liability will not encourage experts to take extreme views. The client who retains a professional expert for court-related work should not be in a worse position than other clients. The practical tools of litigation, including the oath, cross-examination, and the threat of perjury limit any concern about an expert altering his or her opinion because of potential liability. The risk of collateral litigation is exaggerated. There is no basis for suggesting that experts will be discouraged from testifying if immunity were removed &#8211; most are professional people who are insured or can obtain insurance readily, and those who are not insured can limit their liability by contract. See, for a critical analysis, Jurs, <span style="font-style:italic">The Rationale for Expert Immunity or Liability Exposure and Case Law since Briscoe: Reasserting Immunity Protection for Friendly Expert Witnesses</span> (2007-2008) 38 U Mem LR 49.</p>

The general principle does not preclude prosecutions for perjury, or for perverting the course of justice, or for contempt of court, or liability for malicious prosecution, or misfeasance in public office: see, e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Darker v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 AC 435" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 AC 435</ref>.</p>

The immunity has never prevented the possibility of prosecution for perjury of an expert witness who deliberately misleads the court although it would of course be very difficult to prove its elements. As Sir George Jessel MR said in <span style="font-style:italic">Lord Abinger v Ashton </span>(1873) 17 LR Eq 358, 373-374: &#8220;in matters of opinion I very much distrust expert evidence, for several reasons. &#8230;[A]lthough the evidence is given on oath, in point of fact the person knows he cannot be indicted for perjury, because it is only evidence as to a matter of opinion. So that you have not the authority of legal sanction.

An expert may lose his livelihood and entire reputation as a result of an adverse ruling by a professional disciplinary body, but no suggestion has been made on this appeal that the Court of Appeal was wrong to decide that witness immunity does not protect an expert witness from disciplinary proceedings for unprofessional conduct in the preparation of, or giving of, expert evidence: <span style="font-style:italic">Meadow v General Medical Council </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2006/1390" uk:canonical="[2006] EWCA Civ 1390" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWCA Civ 1390</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] QB 462" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] QB 462</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">There are no longer any policy reasons for retaining immunity from suit for professional negligence by expert witnesses. The danger of undesirable multiplicity of proceedings has been belied by the practical experience of the removal of immunity for barristers. A conscientious expert will not be deterred by the danger of civil action by a disappointed client, any more than the same expert will be deterred from providing services to any other client. It is no more (or less) credible that an expert will be deterred from giving evidence unfavourable to the client&#8217;s interest by the threat of legal proceedings than the expert will be influenced by the hope of instructions in future cases. The practical reality is that, if the removal of immunity would have any effect at all on the process of preparation and presentation of expert evidence (which is not in any event likely), it would tend to ensure a greater degree of care in the preparation of the initial report or the joint report. It is almost certain to be one of those reports, rather than evidence in the witness box, which will be the focus of any attack, since it is very hard to envisage circumstances in which performance in the witness box could be the subject of even an arguable case.</p>

Breach of that duty should, in the normal course, give rise to a remedy. This is the unalterable back drop against which the claim to immunity must be made. Whether or not witness immunity has had a long history (and, as to that, I agree with Lord Dyson that this is far from clear) this court should not be deflected from conducting a clear-sighted, contemporary examination of the justification for its preservation. This is particularly required because the immunity has its roots in a time when, as Lord Phillips has pointed out, it was not customary for experts to offer their services under contract for reward.</p>

These are given something of a modern twist by the suggestion that not only would witnesses be deterred from giving evidence but that those who testified would be inclined to tailor their evidence to guard against the risk of being sued. Both these consequences are claimed to be the product of fear that would descend on potential witnesses faced with the daunting prospect of adverse litigation.</p>

It is to be noted that in <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer </span>it was not in dispute that witnesses enjoyed immunity from suit in respect of evidence given whether in civil or criminal proceedings. What was in issue in the case was whether that immunity should extend to work undertaken by the expert in advising the client whether he had a good case worthy of pursuit. At p 488H Mr Tuckey said this:</p>

In the meantime, however, the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Stanton</span> had to confront the question of whether an expert was immune from suit in respect of the contents of a joint statement to which he had contributed following a site meeting between the defendant and the insurers&#8217; expert witness. In deciding that immunity should attach to the contents of the report and relying on the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer</span>, Chadwick LJ said this at pp 100H-101A:</p>

It would also lead to the paradox articulated by Lord Phillips in para 42 of his judgment to the effect that a more convincing case for an immunity could be made, not at the stage of giving evidence, but at the earlier stage when advice that may subsequently prove inconvenient may have been given. When confronted with this, Mr Lawrence QC was prompted to suggest that the zone of protection should be extended backwards so as to comprehend advice given at the early stage.</p>

More importantly, however, there is no evidence that witnesses would react in this way in anticipation of possible proceedings by disappointed clients. In particular, there is nothing to support the assumption that conscientious witnesses (which, if assumptions are to be made at all, professional witnesses must be presumed to be) would behave discreditably by modifying their opinions from those they truly held because they feared that an aggrieved client might unwarrantably seek redress against them. If an expert expresses an honestly held view, even if it differs from that which he may have originally expressed, provided it is an opinion which is tenable, he has nothing to fear from a disgruntled party.</p>

Properly examined, the claimed chilling factors that would descend on expert witnesses if there was removal of the immunity are highly unlikely to materialise. In the final analysis, the only possible reason for preservation of the rule is its supposed longevity. Even if that could be established, it is in no sense an adequate justification for maintaining an immunity whose effect is to deny deserving claimants of an otherwise due remedy.</p>

First, the rationale given for the decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer </span>was that there is a close analogy between the position of experts and that of advocates, so that the immunity/liability line in relation to experts should be drawn at a point which is analogous to the point at which it was drawn in <span style="font-style:italic">Saif Ali </span>in relation to advocates. As Mr Tuckey said at p 488F, the problem of where to draw the line was considered in <span style="font-style:italic">Saif Ali </span>&#8220;in the analogous but not identical situation of the advocate&#8217;s immunity from suit for what he does in court&#8221;. If the analogy is good, it should follow that since (following <span style="font-style:italic">Arthur Hall</span>) advocates no longer have the immunity, experts should not have it either. In other words, the reasoning in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer </span>leads to the inevitable conclusion that it would have been decided differently today.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">But this uncertainty, generated by the difficulty of knowing where to draw the line in any given case, is inherently unsatisfactory, since the difficulty itself contains the seeds of potential litigation. Moreover, there should be a degree of certainty as to the existence of an immunity if it is to be fair and effective. The expert should know in advance whether what he or she says will or will not be protected. This point has been made on a number of occasions. Thus, for example, see per Lord Clyde in <span style="font-style:italic">Darker v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 AC 435" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 AC 435</ref>, 457C. In <span style="font-style:italic">Arthur Hall</span>, Lord Hope said at p 724F that a further reason for regarding the &#8220;core immunity&#8221; in the civil field as no longer justifiable was the difficulty of finding a satisfactory way of defining the limits of the immunity. Lord Hutton said at p 729D that the <span style="font-style:italic">Saif Ali </span>test had proved difficult to apply in practice and had given rise to considerable uncertainty. He agreed with the observation of Kirby J in <span style="font-style:italic">Boland v Yates Property Corpn plc Ltd </span>(1999) 74 ALJR 209, 238, para 137 that it was &#8220;obviously desirable that a clear line establishing the limits of an advocate&#8217;s immunity should be drawn&#8221;.</p>

This is Lord Hope&#8217;s approach. He acknowledges that the general rule that where there is a wrong there should be a remedy is a valuable guide in the right context. But he says that this rule cannot prevail in the present context because it runs contrary to long-established authority. In other words, the existence of a long-established exclusionary rule is itself a sufficient reason for holding that it is necessary to deny a remedy to those who have suffered a wrong.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I respectfully disagree with this approach for two reasons. First, upon close examination the rule that an expert witness retained for reward is immune from liability is not long-established. As Lord Wilberforce explained at p 214E in <span style="font-style:italic">Saif Ali</span>, it is necessary to disentangle three separate strands in relation to the immunity of barristers. The first is the privilege which &#8220;attaches to proceedings in court and protects equally the judge, counsel, witnesses, jurors and parties. It has nothing to do with a barrister&#8217;s duty to his client&#8221;. The second is that in the nature of things an action against a barrister who &#8220;acts honestly and carefully is very unlikely to succeed&#8221;. The third is that the barrister enjoys &#8220;immunity from an action, which depends upon public policy. In fixing its boundary, account must be taken of the counter policy that a wrong ought not to be without a remedy.&#8221;</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus, the fact that there was a long standing rule that all who participated in a trial enjoyed absolute privilege was not because they did not owe a duty of care to those who might be adversely affected by what they said at the trial. As Lord Phillips points out, this rule was established long before the modern law of negligence and, in particular, long before liability for negligent misstatement was first recognised. There is no long-established rule that witnesses are immune from liability <span style="font-style:italic">to their clients</span> in respect of what they say at trial and in connection with litigation. As I have said, the distinct position of such witnesses does not seem to have received the attention of the courts until <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer</span>. It is true that <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer </span>has been approved on a few occasions, but in so far as the rule has been applied in relation to the liability of expert witnesses to their clients, it has shallow roots.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">But secondly, even if there is such a long-established rule, it is based on policy grounds and cannot survive if the policy grounds on which it is based no longer justify the rule. The mere fact that the immunity is long-established is not a sufficient reason for blessing it with eternal life. Circumstances change as do attitudes to the policy reasons which underpin the immunity. The common law develops in response to these changes. The history of the rise and fall of the immunity of advocates provides a vivid illustration of the point. As Lord Reid observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Rondel v Worsley </span>at p 227C, public policy is not immutable and any rule of immunity requires to be considered in the light of present day conditions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The general rule that where there is a wrong there should be a remedy is a cornerstone of any system of justice. To deny a remedy to the victim of a wrong should always be regarded as exceptional. As has been frequently stated, any justification must be necessary and requires strict and cogent justification: see, for example, per Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">Taylor v Director of the Serious Fraud Office </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 AC 177" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 AC 177</ref>, 214D; <span style="font-style:italic">Darker v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police</span> per Lord Hope at p 446D, per Lord Clyde at p 456H and per Lord Hutton at p 468F.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Furthermore, the justification for any exception to this general rule should be kept under review. That is what happened in relation to the immunity of barristers. Their immunity for all that they did was recognised by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Rondel v Worsley</span>. It was based on the public policy grounds that the administration of justice required that a barrister should be able to carry out his duty to the court fearlessly and independently, and that actions for negligence against barristers would make the retrying of the original actions inevitable and so prolong litigation contrary to the public interest. In <span style="font-style:italic">Saif Ali </span>the immunity was limited (again on grounds of public policy) to what barristers did in court and to work that could fairly be said to affect the way that the case would be conducted if it came to a hearing. Finally, the immunity was swept away altogether in <span style="font-style:italic">Arthur Hall</span>, when it was decided that the public policy grounds previously relied on were no longer sufficient to justify a departure from the general rule that where there was a wrong there should be a remedy.</p>

The first is that it is necessary to ensure that expert witnesses will be prepared to give evidence at all. Like Lord Phillips and Lord Hope, I am not impressed with this argument. From time to time, the court is called upon to make decisions on whether to grant or withhold immunity from suit in certain classes of case. It does not expect to be able to make decisions of this kind on the basis of empirical evidence. In my view, surveys such as that carried out at the Bond Solon Annual Expert Witness Conference in November 2010 are of very limited value. It is unrealistic to look for hard evidence in this area.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is easy to assert that professional persons will refuse to act as expert witnesses if they cease to enjoy immunity. The court has to exercise its judgment in assessing the validity of such an assertion. Whether professional persons are willing to give expert evidence depends on many factors. I am not persuaded that the possibility of being sued if they are negligent is likely to be a significant factor in many cases in determining whether a person will be willing to act as an expert. Negligence is not easy to prove against an expert witness, especially in relation to what he or she says in the heat of battle in court. This is the second of the three strands identified by Lord Wilberforce at p 214E in <span style="font-style:italic">Saif Ali</span>. Professional indemnity insurance is available. Professional persons engage in many activities where the possibility of being sued is more realistic than it is in relation to undertaking the role of an expert in litigation. Thus, for example, it is a sad fact of life that births sometimes &#8220;go wrong&#8221; and when that happens, parents sometimes look for someone to blame. But that does not stop people from practising as obstetricians.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The second reason advanced in support of maintaining the immunity is that expert witnesses would be reluctant to give evidence against their clients&#8217; interests if there was a risk that they would be sued. This is the divided loyalty argument that was considered in relation to advocates in <span style="font-style:italic">Rondel v Worsley</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Saif Ali </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Arthur Hall</span>. The argument in those cases was that the advocate owes an &#8220;overriding duty&#8221; to the court and unless there was immunity from liability to the client, there was a danger that they would disregard their duty to the court. Lord Hope suggests in the present case that the duties owed by the advocate to the court are not as far reaching as those owed to the court by the expert. But it is significant that in <span style="font-style:italic">Rondel v Worsley </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Saif Ali </span>the House of Lords described the advocates&#8217; duty to the court as &#8220;overriding&#8221; and regarded that fact as one of the reasons for not withdrawing the immunity. In <span style="font-style:italic">Arthur Hall</span>, Lord Hoffmann recognised that the duty of the advocate to the court is &#8220;extremely important in the English system of justice&#8221;. He described the divided loyalty argument as being that &#8220;the possibility of being sued for negligence would actually inhibit the lawyer, consciously or unconsciously, from giving his duty to the court priority to his duty to his client&#8221;. That is precisely the argument advanced by Mr Lawrence in the present case.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;To assess the likelihood [of the removal of the immunity having a significant adverse effect], I think that one should start by considering the incentives which advocates presently have to comply with their duty and those which might tempt them to ignore it. The first consideration is that most advocates are honest conscientious people who need no other incentive to comply with the ethics of their profession. Then there is the wish to enjoy a good reputation among one&#8217;s peers and the judiciary. There can be few professions which operate in so bright a glare of publicity as that of the advocate. Everything is done in public before a discerning audience. Serious lapses seldom pass unnoticed. And in the background lie the disciplinary powers of the judges and the professional bodies&#8230;.</p>

Perhaps the wish not to cause dissatisfaction which might make the client reluctant to pay. Or the wish to obtain more instructions from the same client. But among these pressures, I would not put high on the list the prospect of an action for negligence. It cannot possibly be negligent to act in accordance with one&#8217;s duty to the court and it is hard to imagine anyone who would plead such conduct as a cause of action.&#8221;</p>

In particular, like advocates, they are professional people who can be expected to want to comply with the rules and ethics of their profession. Experts can be in no doubt that their overriding duty is to the court. That is spelt out in the rules and they are reminded of the duty every time they write a report: rule 35.10(2) states that at the end of the expert&#8217;s report &#8220;there must be a statement that the expert understands and has complied with their duty to the court&#8221;. There is no reason to doubt that most experts are honest conscientious people who need no other incentive to comply with their duty and the rules and ethics of their profession. There may be a few experts (as there may be a few advocates) who behave dishonourably. But that is no more compelling a reason for retaining the immunity for experts than it was for retaining it for advocates.</p>

Experts can and almost always do obtain professional indemnity insurance to cover the risk of negligence.

The respondent is said to have negligently signed an inaccurate joint statement which had been prepared as directed by the judge under CPR 35.12(3). She did not give evidence in court, as the case was subsequently settled. So it is her conduct when she agreed to the way the joint statement had been worded by the other side&#8217;s expert that is the focus of attention. It is common ground that the immunity rule applies to things said or done, or omitted to be said or done, by an expert witness at that stage of the proceedings unless it is subject to the exception for which the appellant contends: see <span style="font-style:italic">Watson v M&#8217;Ewan</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1905] AC 480" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1905">[1905] AC 480</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I have not found this an easy question to answer, for a variety of reasons. The first is to be found in the nature and purpose of the rule itself, which must be the starting point for an inquiry as to whether an exception should be made to it. The second is to be found when an attempt is made to define the limits of the exception. The third is the lack of firm evidence, pointing either one way or the other, as to the need for the exception or as to the consequences if it were to be introduced. The question whether the rule continues to perform a useful function has been raised from time to time. Andrew Edis, &#8220;Privilege and immunity: problems of expert evidence&#8221; (2007) CJQ 40, suggested that compliance with the expert&#8217;s duty to the court would be enhanced by its removal. But it is a very different thing for it to be removed retrospectively, as I assume it will have to be if the appellant&#8217;s claim is be given effect, by a decision of seven Justices in this Court, from which there would be no way back except by legislation enacted by Parliament. I doubt whether it is right that we should proceed in this way only on the basis of assumptions, which is really all we have to go on in this case.</p>

As Lord Steyn said at p 676, it played a particularly helpful part in the appeal. The House was, of course, dealing in that case with an issue which was within the personal experience of all members of the Appellate Committee, and it was known that advocates were already under a professional obligation to carry insurance: see Lord Steyn, p 682; Lord Hoffmann, p 691. In this case we are dealing with an area of practice with whose precise limits I suspect I am not alone in being less familiar. I am unwilling to assume that every witness who gives evidence as an &#8220;expert&#8221; belongs to a professional organisation or engages regularly in court work. Some may be academics, and some may come forward to give expert evidence only once in a lifetime. It seems to me that it would be unwise to assume that they all have insurance cover against claims for negligence.</p>

Of course, if the point is put that way round the immunity that the rule currently provides may seem objectionable. But, as I shall mention later, it was recognised long ago that it is not the purpose of the rule to protect those who are guilty of such transgressions. Its purpose is to ensure that witnesses are not deterred from coming forward to give evidence in court and from feeling completely free to speak the truth when they do so, without facing the risk of being harassed afterwards by actions in which allegations are made against them in an attempt to make them liable in damages.</p>

It diverts attention from the consequences for those who are wholly innocent of any transgression for which damages could properly be awarded, but are nevertheless exposed to harassment by the disgruntled or the unscrupulous. There has been no challenge to the policy justification as it applies to witnesses generally. So the question in this case is whether the reasons which justify an immunity for witnesses generally do not apply to expert witnesses. The grounds for making that exception by judicial decision need to be examined and explained very carefully. This is because they may have implications for the immunity which is at present given to other kinds of witness against whom a breach of duty may be alleged. An incautious removal of the immunity from one class of witness risks destabilising the protection that is given to witnesses generally.</p>

But this is not the state of things under which this question of law has to be determined. Whether the statements were, in fact, untrue, and whether they were dictated by malice, are, and always will be, open questions, upon which opinions may differ, and which can only be resolved by the exercise of human judgment. And the real question is, whether it is proper on grounds of public policy to remit such questions to the judgment of a jury. The reasons against doing so are simple and obvious. A witness may be utterly free from malice, and may yet in the eyes of a jury be open to that imputation; or, again, the witness may be cleared by the jury of the imputation, and may yet have to encounter the expenses and distress of a harassing litigation. With such possibilities hanging over his head, a witness cannot be expected to speak with that free and open mind which the administration of justice demands.&#8221;</p>

He described it as one of the necessities of the administration of justice. In that case a medical practitioner, whom the pursuer had employed as her professional adviser with a view to an action she proposed to bring against her husband for separation and aliment, then gave evidence for the husband in that same action. This was said to have come about because he expressed views to the husband&#8217;s solicitors that made it evident that his opinion was adverse to the position that the wife wished him to adopt. This led to his being requested by those acting for the husband to give evidence on his behalf. He agreed to do so, and in the course of his evidence referred to matters which he had learned on the occasion of his professional visit to the wife relevant to her state of health which, so it was alleged, impressed the judge unfavourably to the wife&#8217;s case and without which, it was said, she would have been successful. An action of damages was then raised by the wife against him for slander and breach of confidentiality. The wife&#8217;s father raised an action of damages against him on similar grounds.

They are best explained in the report of the judgment of the Court of Session at (1904) 7 F 72, in which the averments for both sides are set out. Sir Patrick Watson was a hospital surgeon and clinical teacher with an unrivalled reputation for his operative skill and teaching powers. He accepted instructions from Mrs McEwan with a view to his giving evidence as an expert witness on her behalf. In the event the evidence which he was said to have given, when he appeared as a witness for her husband, was unfavourable to her and in support of the case that was being made against her. He was said in the course of his evidence to have read out notes which he had made during a professional visit when he examined her. They contained entries to the effect that it seemed to him that both the wife and her father were bent on inducing her premature labour (in other words, an abortion) with a view to freeing her from any permanent reminder of the marriage and, if possible, to obtain a separation. This is an early example of the protection being given to an expert witness against an allegation that his evidence to the court was contrary to the interests of the person by whom he had originally been instructed for reward. It was also alleged that what he said was defamatory of her and her father. There was no suggestion that the fact that he may have owed duties to them, such as the duty of confidentiality, made any difference. He was entitled to the protection in the same way as any other witness.</p>

But the report of the case in the Court of Session in the Session Cases shows that the pursuer had proposed four issues for trial:<span style="font-style:italic"> AB v CD </span>(1904) 7 F 72, 76-77. Issue (1) was whether giving the precognition amounted to breach of confidence; issue (2) was whether giving the evidence in court amounted to breach of confidence; issue (3) was whether giving the precognition amounted to slander; and issue (4) was whether giving the evidence in court amounted to slander. The Lord Ordinary disallowed issues (2) and (4), as they related to evidence given in court which attracted the immunity. But he allowed issues (1) and (3), on the view that witness immunity did not extend to giving a precognition. In the Inner House it was argued that the fact that an expert gave evidence by choice and was not compelled to do so meant that he did not require the protection of the immunity. This argument was rejected, and the Inner House agreed with the Lord Ordinary that issues (2) and (4) should be disallowed. But it also disallowed issue (1). Watson then appealed to the House of Lords against the decision of the Inner House that issue (3) should go to trial. This was the issue as to slander in the precognition. The Session Cases report of the case in the House of Lords states that Mrs McEwan cross-appealed against the disallowance of the first issue: <span style="font-style:italic">Watson v M&#8217;Ewan </span>(1905) 7 F (HL) 109, 110.

The Lord Chancellor said that it was impossible to say that any different question arose in the one appeal from that which arose in the other: <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1905] AC 480" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1905">[1905] AC 480</ref>, 485. Both claims as to what was said in the precognition were before the House and, as the outcome of the appeal was that Mrs McEwan&#8217;s case was remitted to the Court of Session to dismiss her action, its ruling that Watson was entitled to the immunity at the precognition stage must be taken to have extended to her claim against him for breach of confidence as well as her claim for slander. That this is how the Lord Chancellor saw the matter appears from the second paragraph of his speech, at p 486, where he said that he was not disposed to express an opinion either way as to the confidential nature of the relationship, which might raise very serious and difficult questions, because he had no difficulty at all in their solution on other grounds:</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">I think that this passage makes it clear that, in his opinion, there were no grounds for distinguishing between the claims that were being made in the action. The immunity extended as much to a claim of damages for breach of a duty of confidence as it did to a claim for slander, or indeed any other claim. The question whether an expert witness was in a different position from an ordinary witness had been raised and dealt with in the Inner House.</p>

Lord Hobhouse of Woodborough said at p 741 that the expert witness was in a special position similar to that of the advocate. But Lord Hoffmann at pp 697-698 rejected the expert witness analogy.

What remained to be considered was whether it was appropriate to draw the circle narrower so that some experts are admitted and some are not. His conclusion was that, while the need to grant immunity may be more obvious in some cases than others, the courts ought not to rush to draw a rigid boundary between situations where immunity is automatically granted to some and not to others. He reminded himself at p 107 that the immunity is not granted primarily for the benefit of the individuals who seek it. They are the beneficiaries of the public interest to ensure that the administration of justice is not impeded, which is the consideration that should be paramount. Although Nourse LJ was prepared to acknowledge that the rule could not be quite the same for experts as for other witnesses as the expert usually has the dual capacity of advising the client as well as giving evidence in support of his case, he saw no justification for distinguishing between an expert and a lay witness either on the ground that the expert is usually remunerated for his services or on the ground that he may be less likely than a lay witness to be deterred from giving evidence.</p>

The proceedings in which they are engaged range across the board, from criminal trials at one extreme to professional disciplinary hearings at the other, with a wide variety of civil proceedings in between. And they range from those whose profession is to give expert evidence and who are very familiar with the court process to those who appear once only in a particular case and who are least likely to have protected themselves against the risk of a claim for negligence.</p>

His proposition was that an expert in civil cases should no longer have immunity from suit in relation to negligent work performed for the substantial purpose of giving evidence in court. He said that it was no part of his argument that his proposition should be applied to expert witnesses in criminal cases or in family law cases either. Nor was it part of his argument that it should be applied to what the expert witness said when giving evidence in court. But I do not think that, if there are good grounds for removing the immunity from that stage of the proceedings, it would be possible to retain it for the stage when the expert gives evidence in court. And it would be difficult to defend its retention where the expert witness gives evidence, or prepares for the giving of evidence, for his client in other tribunals.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In his report, <span style="font-style:italic">Access to Justice </span>(1996), Lord Woolf referred in chapter 13, para 3 to the recommendation in chapter 23 of his interim report that the calling of expert evidence in civil cases should be under the complete control of the court. His concern was that a more economical use should be made of this type of evidence by narrowing the issues between opposing experts as early as possible. Among the points that he made about the way expert evidence was being used was a concern that experts sometimes took on the role of partisan advocates instead of neutral fact finders or opinion givers. In chapter 13, para 25 of his report he said that there was wide agreement that the expert&#8217;s role should be that of an independent adviser to the court, and that lack of objectivity could be a serious problem. In para 27 he said that it was important that each opposing expert&#8217;s overriding duty to the court was clearly understood. In para 30 he said that there was widespread agreement that an expert&#8217;s report intended for use as evidence in court proceedings should be addressed to the court. These observations formed the basis for the rules that are now set out in CPR Part 35 and for Practice Direction 35 which supplements them. CPR Part 35 and the Practice Direction are designed for use in civil cases only. They do not apply to criminal cases, and they do not apply in Scotland either. But it seems to me that the principles which they express are of universal application &#8211; in criminal cases arguably even more so, in view of the overriding public interest in securing the ends of justice in proceedings of that kind.</p>

Lord Hoffmann was perhaps overstating the position when he said in <span style="font-style:italic">Arthur J S Hall &amp; Co v Simons </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] 1 AC 615" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] 1 AC 615</ref>, 698, in the context of a discussion about expert witnesses, that a witness owes no duty of care to anyone in respect of the evidence he gives to the court, as his only duty is to speak the truth. This may be true of witnesses generally, but it is plain that the paid expert owes duties to the client by whom he is being paid. If he agrees for a reward to prepare a report and to present himself in court to give evidence, he is obliged to do those things and to take reasonable care when he is doing so. He must make the necessary investigations and preparations for the giving of that evidence. Nevertheless when it comes to the content of that evidence his overriding duty is to the court, not to the party for whom he appears. His duty is to give his own unbiased opinion on matters within his expertise. It is on that basis that he must be assumed to have agreed to act for his client. It would be contrary to the public interest for him to undertake to confine himself to making points that were in the client&#8217;s interest only and to refrain from saying anything to the court to which his client might take objection.</p>

As Justice Stevens observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Briscoe v LaHue </span>(1983) 460 US 325, 335-336, when a police officer appears as a witness he may reasonably be viewed as acting like any other witness sworn to tell the truth. He may be regarded as an official performing a critical role in the judicial process, in which event he may seek the benefit afforded to other participants in the same proceeding. At p 345 he recognised that the absolute witness immunity bars a path to recovery by defendants who have been convicted on the basis of false testimony:</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">There would seem then, as a starting point, to be a strong case for treating an expert in the same way as any other witness when it comes to the giving of sworn evidence in court. If that is so, the case would seem to be just as strong for treating him in the same way when, on the directions of the court, he is agreeing a joint statement with the opposing expert &#8211; and for treating him in the same way when he is preparing his own report with a view to giving his evidence. Lord Phillips does not see why an expert should be concerned that performance of his duty to the court will result in his being sued for breach of duty to his client: para 56. But this assumption contradicts the justification for the immunity that is extended to witnesses generally, which is that there are grounds from time to time for believing that the fear of suit exists. If he is right, there are seeds here for challenging the whole concept of witness immunity.</p>

But we are not dealing with fringe issues in this case, and in the present context it seems to me that little weight can be attached to it. Removal of the immunity runs counter to long established authority. The question whether it was more important to right wrongs was considered and rejected by Lord Penzance in the House of Lords in<span style="font-style:italic"> Dawkins v Lord Rokeby</span> (1875) LR 7 HL 744: see para 133, above. It was considered again and rejected by Lord President Inglis in <span style="font-style:italic">Williamson v Umphray and Robertson </span>(1890) 17 R 905, by Fry LJ in<span style="font-style:italic"> Munster v Lamb </span>(1883) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="11 QBD 588" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">11 QBD 588</ref> and by the Lord Chancellor in <span style="font-style:italic">Watson v M&#8217;Ewan</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1905] AC 480" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1905">[1905] AC 480</ref>.

By that I think he meant that the immunity should not be extended any further than necessary. That test can be applied without too much difficulty when one is setting limits to the context in which things said or done will attract the immunity. It will then follow that the protection will extend to all claims of whatever nature that fall within that context. Those which fall outside it of whatever nature will not have that protection. It is more difficult to apply the idea that where there is a wrong there must be a remedy to include some wrongs within the scope of the immunity and exclude others that fall within the same context. If it is necessary to give the protection against some claims to enable witnesses to speak freely, why should it not be given to them all? Why should a claim for a breach of duty be treated differently from a claim for defamation? If the claim is well founded, a wrong was done in either case which ought to be remedied.</p>

I am not convinced that this is so. The witness and the advocate perform different functions. The duties that the advocate owes to the court are not as far reaching as the overriding duty to the court that rests on the expert. His principal duty is to his client, not to the court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Lord Phillips makes another point: see paras 46-50. He says that the expert witness can be compared with the advocate, as both undertake a duty to their client. In that respect he has much more in common with the advocate than he does with the witness of fact. Lord Dyson addresses the same issue when he is discussing the problem of divided loyalties: para 120. His conclusion is that the fact that the expert&#8217;s overriding duty is to the court is no more compelling for retaining the immunity for experts than it was for retaining it for advocates. These observations use the fact that the immunity has been withdrawn from the one as an argument for withdrawing it from the other. I find this disturbing. I do not think that anyone who sat in<span style="font-style:italic"> Arthur J S Hall &amp; Co v Simons</span> foresaw that removing the immunity from advocates would be taken as an indication that it should be removed from expert witnesses too. Lord Hoffmann&#8217;s remarks indicate that, rightly or wrongly, he saw no such analogy. Only Lord Hobhouse disagreed with him. Yet here we are a decade later contemplating taking just that step. There is a warning here, to repeat the old adage, that one thing leads to another. Removing just one brick from the wall that sustains the witness immunity may have unforeseen consequences.</p>

But there is a more fundamental point. It is one thing to be liable to a wasted costs order at the instance of the court itself or to proceedings by a professional body for professional misconduct. It is quite another to be at risk of worthless but possibly embarrassing and time-consuming proceedings by a disgruntled and disaffected litigant in person. Insurance cover, if available, is not a universal remedy. And here again one must be careful not to lose sight of the policy choice that was made long ago that, to be effective, the immunity must be for the protection of all, not just those who might otherwise be liable.</p>

It is the risk of the expense and distress of a harassing litigation at the instance of an aggressive client which in some cases, given the vagaries of human nature, may be quite obvious. Lord Penzance thought in <span style="font-style:italic">Dawkins v Lord Rokeby</span> (1875) LR 7 HL 744 that, with such possibilities hanging over his head, a witness could not be expected to speak with that free and open mind which the administration of justice demands.

I would not, on present information, attach much importance to this argument. In any event, without hard information, it is not possible to assess how much weight should be given to it. Experts can usually expect to be paid for their work, and there are no doubt other considerations that will incline them to continue to make themselves available. I would not, however, discard this point as entirely irrelevant. There may be some situations &#8211; some kind of case, some kinds of client &#8211; where the expert would be reluctant to become involved at all. If that were to happen it would raise questions as to whether access to justice for the disadvantaged was being inhibited.

Although Mr Ter Haar was careful to confine his submissions to civil cases and to the relationship between the expert and his own client only, it is hard to see how one could justify removing the immunity in that respect but keeping it for all the other tribunals which hear evidence for experts. This would be a matter of particular concern in the criminal jurisdiction. The expert for the prosecution would continue to enjoy the immunity from proceedings at the instance of the defendant. The expert for the defence would have it removed from him. One cannot discount the fact that exposure to the risk of incurring the expense and distress of a harassing litigation at the client&#8217;s instance should the defence fail, however unlikely, will colour his evidence. The public interest surely demands that experts who give evidence on either side in criminal proceedings are free from pressures of that kind.</p>

The Law Commission has recently completed a project in which it addressed the admissibility of expert evidence in criminal proceedings in England and Wales: see Law Com No 325 (HC 829, 21 March 2011). The question of immunity was not raised at any stage during its consideration of this issue.

They propose therefore to modify their present practice and, while treating former decisions of this House as normally binding, to depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Lord Hope has demonstrated, to my mind convincingly, that there is House of Lords&#8217; authority, in the shape of <span style="font-style:italic">Watson v M&#8217;Ewan </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1905] AC 480" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1905">[1905] AC 480</ref>, for the general proposition that no cause of action of any kind lies against any witness in respect of the evidence he gives to a court. The rule was first developed as a protection against suits in defamation, but there is no reason in principle to limit it to these. If the purpose is to ensure that witnesses can prepare and give their evidence freely to the court, irrespective of whether it might otherwise constitute a tort or a breach of contract against someone else, then it should not matter what the source of that liability might be: whether saying or writing something which is defamatory of someone else; or saying or writing something in breach of a duty of confidence owed to someone else; or saying or writing something in breach of a contractual duty owed to someone else; or saying or writing something in breach of what would otherwise be a tortious duty owed to someone else. The rule has been taken for granted by courts at all levels for a very long time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I therefore agree with Lord Hope that we are here concerned with whether we should carve out an exception to that long established rule. There are, of course, existing exceptions. The most important is perjury, but among the others are contempt of court, professional misconduct (assuming <span style="font-style:italic">Meadow v General Medical Council </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2006/1390" uk:canonical="[2006] EWCA Civ 1390" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2006">[2006] EWCA Civ 1390</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] QB 462" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] QB 462</ref> to be correctly decided), and liability for the wasted costs of the other side (assuming <span style="font-style:italic">Phillips v Symes (No 2) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2004/2330" uk:canonical="[2004] EWHC 2330 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] EWHC 2330 (Ch)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2005] 1 WLR 2043" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2005">[2005] 1 WLR 2043</ref> to be correctly decided). It has been suggested that these exceptions, and in particular the last two, make such inroads into the rule that they call its whole purpose into question. In my view they do no such thing. These exceptions are all, in their different ways, in support of the courts&#8217; interest in witnesses behaving properly: telling the truth, obeying court orders or respecting the undertakings given to the court, behaving professionally so as to justify the courts&#8217; confidence in their expertise and not wasting the time of the court or the other parties. In short, they are there to encourage, indeed to oblige, the witness to perform her duty to the court. They are not there to protect the interests of the witness&#8217;s client. The exception which we are being asked to make is to protect the interests of the client. That is a significant departure from existing principles.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The rule may have been established before certain developments in law and practice &#8211; in particular the modern evolution of the law of negligence and the practice of paying expert witnesses to give their opinions in civil or criminal cases. But these are not new developments in the way that, for example, email and the internet are new developments which the existing law must find ways of accommodating. A professional person has always owed her client a contractual duty to exercise reasonable care and skill: its statutory recognition in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1982/29" uk:canonical="1982 c. 29" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982</ref> was not intended to change the law. It has never, so far as I am aware, been contrary to public policy for a party to litigation to pay an expert for her advice in connection with the litigation. The development is one of quantity not quality.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">If an exception is to be made, the boundaries of that exception must be logical and clear. As I understand it, there is no question of removing the absolute privilege which all witnesses enjoy against defamation, whether or not the person defamed is their client. As I also understand it, there is no question of erecting a duty of care where none would otherwise exist, and thus of rendering an expert witness liable to the other side or to anyone else involved in the litigation apart from her own client. The rationale for the proposed exception is that, without the rule, an expert witness would owe a duty of care to her own client and there is no reason why she should not be liable if she has caused her client loss through the breach of that duty. I am unclear whether the exception would apply only in a case where there was a contractual duty or whether it would apply in a case where there was no contractual duty but there might be a duty owed in tort. Or is it to be assumed that the two are co-terminous? I doubt that because there may be situations where there is no contractual duty, for example because the contract was made with the party&#8217;s legal advisers, but where there could be a duty in tort were it not for witness immunity.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I ask these questions because, as it seems to me, it would be impossible to confine any exception to run of the mill cases like the present. The present case is a classic personal injury action. The claimant was injured in a road traffic accident. There is a variety of medical evidence available. Some of it comes from the doctors who have been treating him for his injuries. Some of it comes from doctors, and in this case a clinical psychologist, who have been instructed by one side or the other to give their expert opinion purely for the purpose of the litigation. These last are the paradigm case on which the rationale for the proposed exception is based. They have been called in to give their opinion for the purpose of the litigation. They are paid a fee for doing so. They would ordinarily owe a contractual duty to exercise reasonable care and skill, either directly to the client or through the client&#8217;s legal advisers. Why should they not be held liable to the client if they fail to exercise that care and skill? After all, as professionals, they will only fail in their duty if they fail the <span style="font-style:italic">Bolam </span>test (<span style="font-style:italic">Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1957] 1 WLR 582" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1957">[1957] 1 WLR 582</ref>); and as witnesses, they will be excused much in the hurly-burly of the trial.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">These are powerful arguments indeed in the context in which they are deployed. Mr Ter Haar QC, for the appellant claimant, was at pains to exclude consideration of the liability of expert witnesses in other contexts. But I do not think that we can exclude it. If we are to change the law, we must do so in a principled way. If the exception is made, it will clearly have to apply between expert witnesses and their clients in all kinds of civil proceedings, before all kinds of courts and tribunals: the surveyor who gives valuation evidence in a leasehold enfranchisement case; the plasterer who gives quantum meruit evidence in a building dispute; the engineer who explains how a machine works in a factory accident; or the scientist who explains how DNA works in a patent case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">All of this may sound straightforward. But even in ordinary civil cases, it is not completely so. A doctor who has treated the patient after an accident or for an industrial disease may be called upon, not only to give evidence of what happened at the time, but also to give an opinion as to the future. Sometimes there may be a fee involved and sometimes not. Is the proposed exception to cover all or only some of her evidence? In many civil cases, there are commonly now jointly instructed experts on some issues. A jointly instructed expert owes contractual duties to each of the parties who instruct her. A party who is disappointed by her evidence will often find it difficult to persuade the court to allow a further expert to be instructed to enable her evidence to be properly tested. But the disappointed party does not have to ask the court&#8217;s permission to find an expert who will enable him to launch proceedings against the jointly instructed expert. Because such an expert is extremely likely to disappoint one of those instructing her, she may be more vulnerable to such actions than is the expert instructed by one party alone.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">How far beyond ordinary civil proceedings is this exception to go? I have already suggested that it would have to apply to essentially private law proceedings in tribunals as well as in courts &#8211; thus to proceedings between landlord and tenant in leasehold valuation, service charge, rent assessment and other such disputes; or between employer and employee in unfair dismissal, redundancy, discrimination and breach of contract cases. But what about cases which are essentially public law proceedings? Should the &#8220;independent&#8221; psychiatrist who is instructed on behalf of the patient in tribunal proceedings under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1983/20" uk:canonical="1983 c. 20" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Mental Health Act 1983</ref> be covered by the proposed exception? Should the educational psychologist or child psychiatrist instructed by the parents of a child with special educational needs to give evidence in tribunal proceedings under Part 4 of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/56" uk:canonical="1996 c. 56" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Education Act 1996</ref>? These are sensitive and often highly fraught cases in which performing the expert&#8217;s duty to the tribunal may well be perceived by the client patient or parent as a breach of her duty towards him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This brings me to family proceedings, in which all of these various situations can arise. The most obvious analogy with an ordinary civil case is ancillary relief proceedings between husband and wife. Expert valuation or forensic accountancy evidence is common. If such experts may be held liable to their clients in other civil proceedings, it is hard to see why they should not be so liable in ancillary relief proceedings. The next example is proceedings between mother and father (or other relatives) about the future of their children. Often, the court will be assisted by a welfare report from a Cafcass officer. That officer is not instructed by either party and so will presumably run no risk of liability to either of them. But sometimes the parties will jointly instruct a child psychiatrist or psychologist to assist the court. Is such an expert to be potentially liable to the disappointed parent even though it is generally accepted that her principal duty is owed, not to the parents, but to the child? And sometimes, even in these private law disputes, the child will be separately represented. Such cases are so difficult and sensitive that it is quite likely that an expert will be instructed on behalf of the child. Is such an expert to be potentially liable to the child?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Then there are public law proceedings between a local authority, the child and the parents. There will often be a great deal of expert evidence. Some of the evidence will come from social workers employed or instructed by the local authority. Some of these will be simple witnesses of fact. Some will have carried out expert risk assessments. Many will do both. Are they to be potentially liable to the local authority in respect of all or only some of their evidence? Some of the evidence will come from doctors, nurses and other health care professionals who have treated or looked after the child at critical times. They may be called as witnesses by any party to the proceedings but are usually called by the local authority. I do not know, but it may be that they are sometimes paid a fee for giving an expert opinion to the court. Are they to be potentially liable to whoever called them as witnesses in respect of all or only some of their evidence? Some of the evidence will come from health care professionals who have not treated the child, but have been called in to make an assessment for the purpose of potential or actual care proceedings. They may be instructed by the local authority, the parents or the child&#8217;s guardian. Are they to be potentially liable to whoever instructed them? Should any of this depend upon whether the expert is paid a fee specifically for her appearance in court, or provides her assessment as part of her ordinary duties to the health or social care services, who may not be party to the proceedings, or provides it as part of a special arrangement between the agencies?</p>

When the case went to the House of Lords, as one of those reported as <span style="font-style:italic">X v Bedfordshire County Council </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1995] 2 AC 633" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1995">[1995] 2 AC 633</ref>, at pp 754-755, Lord Browne-Wilkinson pointed out that this was factually incorrect: the psychiatrist had made a report which was relied upon in the proceedings. He also concluded that there should be no liability for investigations which had such an immediate link with possible proceedings. But this was in the context of the case as a whole, where it was held that there was no duty of care owed to a child by the professionals involved in deciding whether or not to institute proceedings to protect him from abuse. In <span style="font-style:italic">D v East Berkshire Community NHS Trust </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2003/1151" uk:canonical="[2003] EWCA Civ 1151" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] EWCA Civ 1151</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] QB 558" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] QB 558</ref>, the Court of Appeal held that both doctors and social workers did owe a duty of care to the child when conducting child protection investigations. Discussing the impact of witness immunity, at paras 113-117, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers MR compared the approach of Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span style="font-style:italic">X v Bedfordshire </span>with the &#8220;more detailed consideration&#8221; of witness immunity in <span style="font-style:italic">Darker v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 AC 435" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 AC 435</ref>.

The purpose of the immunity is to protect witnesses against claims made against them for something said or done in the course of giving or preparing to give evidence. It is not to be used to shield the police from action for things done while they are acting as law enforcers or investigators.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">Lord Phillips went on to say that it may not be easy to draw the line between investigation and preparation of evidence in cases of suspected child abuse but the Court clearly held that that was where the line should be drawn. To that extent, therefore, the view taken in <span style="font-style:italic">X v Bedfordshire </span>has been superseded by later authority. There was no appeal to the House of Lords against that aspect of the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">D v East Berkshire NHS Trust</span>. There may, therefore, be a relatively clear dividing line between conducting the examinations and investigations, on the one hand, and preparing for and giving evidence, on the other.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">But what these examples also make clear is that in many family cases, if the law is to be changed, there will be some professional witnesses who enjoy immunity in respect of their evidence and some who do not. Some of those distinctions will appear arbitrary. Whereas in the past, all enjoyed the same immunity, in the future only some will do so. This will introduce a dimension to the interactions between the experts, and between the experts and the courts, which was not there before. To what extent will the court, in evaluating an expert&#8217;s evidence, take account of that expert&#8217;s potential liability to a client or the lack of it?</p>

But it is impossible to say what effect the removal of immunity will have, either on the care with which the experts give their evidence, or upon their willingness to do so. It is certainly possible that it will reduce any tendency to act as a &#8220;hired gun&#8221; and that would be a very good thing; but it is also possible that it will increase the pressure on an expert to stick to her previous opinion for fear of being sued if she retracts or modifies it. It is possible that it will have no effect at all upon the willingness of experts to give evidence; it is also possible that, in certain fields at least, it will reduce their willingness to do so, or even to become involved in the particular field of practice at all. It is possible that professional indemnity insurance premiums will rise and that fees for giving expert evidence will also rise to take account of this; it is possible that exclusion clauses may be introduced into contracts to give expert evidence, in which case we shall be back where we started.</p>

If they are truly expert professionals, they should not allow any of this to affect their behaviour. The major concern is about the effect upon disappointed litigants. I agree with Lord Hope that the object of the rule is to protect all witnesses, the great majority of whom are trying to do a professional job and are well aware of their duties to the court, against the understandable but usually unjustifiable desire of a disappointed litigant to blame someone else for his lack of success in court.</p>

To my mind, it is irresponsible to make such a change on an experimental basis. This seems to me self-evidently a topic more suitable for consideration by the Law Commission and reform, if thought appropriate, by Parliament rather than by this Court.</p>
