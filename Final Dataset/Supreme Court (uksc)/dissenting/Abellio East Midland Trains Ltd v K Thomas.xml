	    <p class="text" style="margin-right:-0.28in"><span style="font-weight:bold">UNLAWFUL DEDUCTION FROM WAGES</span></p>
	    <p class="text" style="margin-right:-0.28in">The Claimant, who was employed by the respondent as Area Manager for the Leicester Area, agreed to move to a new position as Area Manager for Nottingham and was told that he would receive an increased salary to reflect the greater responsibilities in that role. The Claimant and Respondent failed to agree the increased salary and the Claimant&#8217;s employment was eventually terminated. The tribunal decided that the Claimant was entitled to a remedy in unjust enrichment, a quantum meruit payment, for the work he did in the &#8220;entirely different&#8221; position in Nottingham. It decided that he should have been paid an increased salary while in that position, and such a claim could be brought as an unlawful deductions from wages claim under Part II of the <span style="font-weight:bold"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/18" uk:canonical="1996 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Employment Rights Act 1996</ref></span>.</p>
	    <p class="text" style="margin-right:-0.28in"><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Held</span><span style="font-weight:bold"> (allowing the appeal)</span>. An unjust enrichment claim for a quantum meruit could not be brought under Part II of the <span style="font-weight:bold">1996 Act</span>. Following <span style="font-weight:bold">Delaney v Staples</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1992] 1 AC 687" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1992">[1992] 1 AC 687</ref>, the essential characteristics of &#8220;wages&#8221; for the purpose of Part II are that they are work done or to be done under a subsisting contract of employment. But where an individual was engaged under a worker&#8217;s contract, and so could potentially bring a claim under Part II, a quantum meruit could only be brought in respect of additional work which went beyond the scope of the existing contract. Moreover, claims for quantum meruit with difficulty fit with the structure of a claim for unlawful deductions from wages. The appeal was therefore allowed.</p>
	    <p class="text" style="margin-right:-0.28in">While the decision on Part II of the <span style="font-weight:bold">Act</span> resolved the appeal, the tribunal&#8217;s conclusion that the work at Nottingham was in an &#8220;entirely different position&#8221; or in an &#8220;entirely different role&#8221; was a sufficient finding that the work being done in that role, at the Respondent&#8217;s request, was necessarily outside the scope of the original contract. If the tribunal had jurisdiction under Part II of the <span style="font-weight:bold">1996 Act</span>, it would therefore have been entitled to award the claimant a quantum merit.</p>

It was heard by Employment Judge (&#8220;EJ&#8221;) Hutchinson, sitting alone, on 14 August 2020. The Tribunal held that the respondent had made unauthorised deductions from the wages of Mr Thomas, the Claimant, in the period from 26 April to 12 November 2019. According to the EJ, those under-payments arose from a quantum meruit to which the Claimant was entitled while he worked as Area Manager for Nottingham.</p>

His Statement of Terms of Employment, setting out his terms and conditions, commenced with a &#8220;Summary of Terms of Employment&#8221;, which recorded his role as &#8220;Area Manager&#8221;, his place of work as Leicester and his salary as &#163;42,000. Clause 3 of the subsequent terms referred to a job description, which I was told did not exist and said his job title and location of work were as set out in the Summary of Terms. </p>

Nottingham was the biggest and most complex station in the franchise network, and the Claimant was told there would be an increase in salary to reflect the greater responsibilities in that role. There was, however, no agreement about the specific amount of the increased salary when the Claimant accepted the role (Tribunal judgment paragraphs 9-12).</p>

As the EJ recorded at paragraph 14, the claimant was sent an &#8220;Employee Change Form&#8221; dated 3 April 2019. It gave 1 April as the date of the changes, listed his new location/place of work as Leicester instead of Nottingham and referred to a new job title of &#8220;Area Manager - Nottingham&#8221; in place of &#8220;Area Manager - Leicester&#8221;. In relation to salary, however, it said &#8220;no change&#8221; because at that stage nothing had been agreed. The Claimant did not sign a later letter, dated 26 April 2019, agreeing to a change of location but with &#8220;all other terms and conditions&#8221; unchanged because the terms of his new role, and in particular his salary, had not been agreed (Tribunal, paragraph 16).</p>

It seems it was agreed that the claimant would receive an initial salary increase to &#163;48,000, with the possibility of a later increase to &#163;52,000 on a review. Another employee change form was issued to that effect, dated 7 June 2019 and recording a new salary of &#163;48,000, backdated to 11 March (Tribunal judgment, paragraphs 18-22).</p>

He briefly summarised the submissions of each party&#8217;s counsel. For the Respondent, Mr Fitzpatrick submitted there never was an agreement to increase the Claimant&#8217;s wages to any new sum, so that the wages properly payable to him were those under his existing salary, of &#163;42,000. On behalf of the Claimant, counsel submitted there was an oral agreement to pay &#163;52,000 or, in the absence of a binding agreement, the claimant had a right to a quantum meruit for the services he provided as Area Manager of Nottingham, which fell within the definition of wages in section 27 of ERA. She cited <span style="font-weight:bold">Ajar-Tec v Stak</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/543" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 543" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 543</ref> and <span style="font-weight:bold">Benedetti v Sawiris</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2010/1424" uk:canonical="[2010] EWCA Civ 1424" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] EWCA Civ 1424</ref>. It should be noted that <span style="font-weight:bold">Ajar-Tek</span> was a case about whether someone was a worker under an implied contract, and <span style="font-weight:bold">Benedetti</span> subsequently went to the Supreme Court, which allowed a cross-appeal against the Court of Appeal: see <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] AC 938" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] AC 938</ref>.

He rejected the argument that there was an express oral agreement to pay the Claimant &#163;52,000 because the Claimant knew that the &#8220;agreement&#8221; to pay him that salary had to be ratified by HR, which it never was (paragraph 50). He also rejected the submission that the Claimant was entitled to a salary of &#163;48,000 based on the letters of 1 June and 11 September 2019, because both letters required express acceptance by the Claimant to have legal effect (paragraph 51).

In New Century Cleaning v Church <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] IRLR 27" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] IRLR 27</ref>, a majority of the Court of Appeal (Morritt LJ and Beldam LJ) held that words &#8220;payable&#8221; in section 27, and &#8220;properly payable&#8221; in section 13  connoted a legal entitlement to the payment but were not restricted to contractual entitlements (Morritt LJ at [43], Beldam LJ at [62]). An example in this category are the sums due as payments for annual leave under the <span style="font-weight:bold">Working Time Regulations 1998</span>, which arise by virtue of the regulations rather than contract, and which were held in <span style="font-weight:bold">Stringer</span> to fall within the definition of wages in s.27.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2">
		<p class="FootnoteText"> In <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">New Century</span>, Beldam LJ at [62] gave the examples of a minimum wage ordered by a wage council or customary payments due under collective agreements.

		    <p style="margin-left:1in">&#8220;Where then in the dividing line to be drawn? In my judgment one is thrown back on the basic concept of wages as being payments in respect of the rendering of services during employment, so as to exclude all payments in respect of termination of that contract save to the extent that such latter payments are expressly included in the definition in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/48/section/7/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 7(1)</ref>. It follows that payments in respect of &#8220;garden leave&#8221; (my category (1)) are &#8220;wages&#8221; within the meaning of the act since they are advance payments of wages falling due under a subsisting contract of employment. But all other payments in lieu whether or not contractually payable are not within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/48" uk:canonical="1986 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> since they are payments relating to the termination of services under the employment. To draw a distinction between those cases where the payment in lieu is contractually based and the normal payment in lieu which consists of liquidated damages would be to invite numerous disputes as to the jurisdiction of the industrial tribunal which cannot have been Parliament&#8217;s intention&#8221;.</p>

Many claims which fall within Part II involve factual or legal questions meaning that no precisely specified sum is due: examples are payments during garden leave (Lord Browne-Wilkinson&#8217;s category (1)) in circumstances where an employee is paid as a function of results instead of a fixed salary (e.g. commission); claims for holiday pay of the sort brought following <span style="font-weight:bold">Stringer</span>; and even some elements in claims for a &#8220;week&#8217;s pay&#8221; in Chapter II of Part XIV of ERA (see e.g. section 228). The distinction, to me at least, between a claim which is &#8220;quantified&#8221; and &#8220;quantifiable&#8221; is elusive and Wall LJ accepted that claims under Part II may involve issues of fact [56]. The <span style="font-weight:bold">Coors</span> case does illustrate, however, that there may come a point where damages are at large and must be assessed by the court, so that there insufficient parameters to determine what is &#8220;properly payable&#8221; on any occasion. Damages for the loss of a chance, which is how Chadwick LJ analysed the claims in <span style="font-weight:bold">Coors</span>, are not properly &#8220;quantifiable&#8221; at the time at all. In the same vein, in <span style="font-weight:bold">New Century Cleaning</span>, where the amount to be paid to each window cleaner in a team depended on how the team members agreed to split the sum paid by the employer for each job, Morritt LJ held that the amount to be paid to each individual window cleaner by the employer was not &#8220;objectively ascertainable&#8221; [46]. Unless and until the agreement was reached within the team, there were no objective parameters for determining what sum was due to each individual.</p>

The first, and principal, difficulty is that a quantum meruit does not fit readily into Lord Browne-Wilkinson&#8217;s conception of &#8220;wages&#8221; for the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/48" uk:canonical="1986 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref> and its descendant in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/48/section/27" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 27</ref> of <span style="font-weight:bold">ERA</span>. While Lord Browne-Wilkinson referred at 697F to the &#8220;basic concept of wages as being payments in respect of the rendering of services during employment&#8221;, which might be read as capturing services for which a quantum meruit is payable, his words must be read in context. Lord Browne-Wilkinson was clearly referring back to his early explanation- &#8220;one is thrown back to the basic concept&#8221; - where he said that the &#8220;essential characteristic of wages is that they are consideration for work done or to be done under a contract of employment&#8221; (at 692B). To underline that point, in both paragraphs he spoke of wages being referable to an obligation under a subsisting contract: see 692B-C, 697G.</p>

In the present case, it appears the EJ decided that the quantum meruit was payable at the same time as the claimant&#8217;s existing salary was paid (paragraph 57). This was probably a consequence of his decision that the sum due was the higher salary, of &#163;52,000. But in many claims for a quantum meruit there will be no fixed date on which payment should be made, making the statutory scheme unworkable or workable only with difficulty: see Lord Browne-Wilkison in <span style="font-weight:bold">Delaney</span> at 696F-H.

But, for the reasons set out above, I consider that assumption was wrong in law. I therefore allow the appeal on ground (2).</p>

This ground is that the tribunal erred in deciding that the Claimant was entitled on the facts to a quantum meruit because, Mr Fitzpatrick argues, there was a subsisting contract which itself governed the remuneration payable. In light of my conclusion on ground (2), this ground is strictly unnecessary to determine the appeal. But I heard full argument on it and so I consider I should decide the issue.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>Mr Fitzpatrick relied on various cases which, he said, established that a quantum meruit claim only exists in the absence of a contractual term governing remuneration, such as <span style="font-weight:bold">Diamandis</span> at [83]. Here, he submitted, there was an existing contract which provided for remuneration, in the sum of an annual salary of &#163;42,000. Although in his written skeleton he said that for a quantum meruit to be payable the additional work &#8220;must be in no way attributable to the existing contract&#8221;, in oral argument he accepted that test was not reflected in the authorities. Rather, he submitted, a claim for a quantum meruit would only be available if the work done went beyond the scope of the existing contract. Nonetheless, he maintained that the work done by the claimant as Area Manager of Nottingham fell within the scope of his existing contract or that the Tribunal did not properly consider the applicable principles.</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>I consider Mr Fitzpatrick was correct to reformulate the principle in the way he did by reference to the scope of the contract. In <span style="font-weight:bold">Powell v Braun</span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid"/><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1954] 1 WLR 401" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1954">[1954] 1 WLR 401</ref> the plaintiff employed the defendant as his secretary and, after she had worked for him for two years, in 1946 he wrote to her promising to pay her a bonus each year based on trading results. The plaintiff agreed to his proposal and, relying on his offer, undertook additional responsibilities to those she had performed or would have performed under her existing contract. The Court of Appeal, overruling the judge below, held the plaintiff was entitled to a quantum meruit for the additional work she had done. The defendant had agreed to pay something, so that he did not have an unfettered discretion to pay nothing. It was no objection to awarding the plaintiff a reasonable sum that the remuneration was additional to her fixed salary: Evershed MR at 405, Denning LJ at 406, Romer LJ at 406-7. The analogy with the present claim is obvious, and the Court of Appeal did not consider whether the additional work was, in some sense, attributable to the existing contract. </p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>Although in <span style="font-weight:bold">Powell</span> the court did not formulate the underlying principle that a quantum meruit may be payable where work goes beyond the scope of the existing contract, that was the basis of the judgment of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-weight:bold">Cooke</span>. There the defendant inherited land and engaged the claimants as &#8220;property consultants&#8221; to sell the property. Under the terms of the contract the claimants were entitled to commission if the property were sold for more than &#163;2 million as a result of their assistance. The claim for breach of contract failed, but the Court of Appeal upheld the judge&#8217;s finding that the claimants were entitled to a quantum meruit for additional work they had done at the defendant&#8217;s request, investigating the value of gravel on the land. Lloyd LJ held that such work &#8220;was not in reality done under the contract&#8221;; rather, it was &#8220;something done at [the defendant&#8217;s] express request, which went beyond the scope of the contract. That is a proper basis for an award on a quantum meruit basis&#8221; [34]. He repeated that test in dismissing the defendant&#8217;s appeal at [42], stating that the extra work was &#8220;done outside the scope of the contract for which no price or remuneration had been fixed under the contract&#8221;. </p>

Alternatively, the EJ had failed to direct himself to consider whether the work in the Nottingham role fell within the scope of the original contract.</p>

Their logic appears to be inconsistent with <span style="font-weight:bold">Powell</span>, where the plaintiff continued in the same role under her existing contract. Here, the tribunal decided that the post of Area Manager in Nottingham was an &#8220;entirely different role&#8221; or &#8220;an entirely different position&#8221; (see paragraphs 46 and 54). The EJ had earlier held that Nottingham was the &#8220;biggest and most complex&#8221; station on the respondent&#8217;s network, with many performance issues, so that the new role involved greater responsibilities (paragraphs 11, 12). His conclusion that the role was &#8220;entirely different&#8221;  was supported, further, by the claimant&#8217;s &#8220;Summary of Terms of Employment&#8221; which gave his place of work as &#8220;Leicester&#8221;, and which were referred to in the subsequent terms as setting out his &#8220;job title and location&#8221;; the heading of each page of the Statement of Terms which read &#8220;Kev Thomas - Area Manager - Leicester&#8221;; and his offer letter of 18 January 2019 which referred to an offer of &#8220;the role of Area Manager based at Leicester&#8221;.</p>

I consider he was right not to do so. Not only would that argument be inconsistent with how the claimant&#8217;s job was described in the various contractual documents, but it would also fail to accord with the Employee Change Forms dated 3 April 2019 and 7 June 2019 issued by the Respondent because they indicated that the Claimant had a new place of work and a new job title - &#8220;Area Manager - Nottingham&#8221; (and the second indicated that as a result he was entitled to an increased salary, even if this was never agreed).</p>

	    <p class="Level1" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><marker name="tab"/>In those circumstances, in my view the tribunal was correct to decide that the Claimant was entitled to a quantum meruit for the work he did following his working in the Nottingham post. It is correct that the EJ did not expressly ask himself whether the work done by the Claimant fell outside the scope of his existing contract. But he can hardly be criticised for that, because it seems he was not referred to the key cases or principles applying where a quantum meruit is claimed for work which is additional to that done under an existing contract. His conclusion that the work at Nottingham was in an &#8220;entirely different position&#8221; or in an &#8220;entirely different role&#8221; was a sufficient finding that the work being done in that role was necessarily outside the scope of the original, subsisting contract. Moreover, it appears to have been the only correct finding on the evidence. The claimant was still working as an Area Manager but, at the respondent&#8217;s request, in a different position at a different location and with additional responsibilities which entailed changes to his existing terms and conditions. There was no appeal against the quantum of the award made by the EJ. Accordingly, in those circumstances, if the tribunal had jursidiction under Part II of ERA, I would have dismissed the appeal on ground (1).</p>
