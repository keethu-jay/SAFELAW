	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The flags protest, as it has become known, took place throughout Northern Ireland in late 2012 and early 2013. The series of demonstrations and marches that the protest involved presented the Police Service with enormous, almost impossible, difficulties. They strove to deal with those difficulties by using different policing techniques and strategies; responding to intelligence reports; considering representations made by community leaders; continuously re-evaluating their decisions; and consulting interested parties who might contribute to the resolution of the problems caused by the protests. They also recorded the deliberations that they undertook and the consultations that they held within the Police Service. A great many police officers were deployed to police the demonstrations and marches. A considerable number of them sustained injuries. Assiduous detection of offenders and their prosecution continued throughout this unhappy time.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">There can be no reasonable suggestion, therefore, that the police failed to treat the control of parades and demonstrations with sufficient seriousness. They were obviously exercised at an early stage, and throughout the period when the parades and the disorder took place, to seek to control the marches and to minimise the disorder to which they gave rise. It is also clear that police were constantly concerned about the risk of greater disorder occurring with the consequent risk to life which might accrue if they tried to prevent the parades from taking place altogether, rather than policing and controlling them as best they could. This case is not about the sincerity and authenticity of the efforts made by police to control the parades. It is about their conception and understanding of the powers available to them to do so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The various managerial and strategic steps undertaken by the police and the tactical decisions made on foot of them reflect the standards required of and the demands made on a modern police force. It is also, of course, necessary for a police force in our society to have a proper understanding of the extent of the legal powers available to them in order to discharge their duties effectively and fairly in service of the community. The question whether the Police Service for Northern Ireland (&#8220;PSNI&#8221;) was sufficiently aware of the full range and scope of those powers is now the principal issue in this appeal.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">This was not always the position. Application for leave to apply for judicial review was first made on 31 January 2013. Its primary focus was on obtaining relief in relation to a planned parade on 2 February and challenging the failure of PSNI to give assurances that they would take action to prevent that parade from taking place. The statement served in support of the application under Order 53 of the Rules of the Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland (1980) did, however, contain the claim that the failure of PSNI to prevent the parade had the effect of undermining the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Public Processions (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/47" uk:canonical="1998 c. 47" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Northern Ireland) Act 1998</ref></ref> and that it constituted a breach of their obligations under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/32/section/32" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 32</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/32" uk:canonical="2000 c. 32" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Police (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/1" uk:canonical="2000 c. 1" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Northern Ireland) Act 2000</ref></ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">As the case progressed and the reasons that the police had not taken action to stop various parades became clear, the emphasis has shifted to an attack on PSNI&#8217;s failure to recognise and make use of legal powers available to it to prevent the parades from taking place. It is still argued that that failure has undermined the efficacy and proper functioning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref>. It is also claimed that the operational decisions of the police have not been proportionate. But these latter arguments have featured somewhat less prominently in the appellant&#8217;s presentation of his appeal before this court.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">For a number of years before 1998, considerable public disorder and community conflict were regular features of many contentious parades in Northern Ireland. Until the enactment of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref>, the police were responsible for deciding whether parades should be permitted to proceed. This placed them in a wholly invidious position. Their impartiality was questioned and they were accused of taking sides both in permitting some parades to proceed and banning others. It was against this background that a report was commissioned by the government into what should be done about the management and control of public processions in Northern Ireland. The chairman of the body which produced the report was Dr Peter North and the report has become known as &#8220;the North report&#8221;. Some details about the recommendations which the report contained are given at paras 45-49 below.</p>

The commission was charged under section 8 with the function of controlling parades by means of conditions regulating their conduct, imposed on those who organised them. The commission did not have power to prohibit a procession. The Secretary of State did have such a power under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref>, on specific grounds, but it has never been exercised.</p>

In order for that vital element to work, a statutory duty (section 6(1)) was placed on those proposing to organise a public procession to give advance notice of that proposal to a member of the police force. By section 6(7) it was made a criminal offence to organise or to take part in a public procession which had not been notified. It was also an offence to fail to comply with any conditions imposed. None of the flags parades in Belfast was notified to the commission.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Under the general law the police have a duty to prevent the commission of offences. That fundamental duty of the police, inherent at common law, is expressly confirmed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/32/section/32" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 32</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/32" uk:canonical="2000 c. 32" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2000 Act</ref>. There was power, therefore, to prevent a parade from taking place on the grounds that it was likely to result in public order offences. But under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref> there was also power to prevent the commission of the offence of processing in an un-notified parade. The complaint which is made of the police in the present case is that they were conscious of the first of those powers, but they did not properly appreciate the existence and significance of the second.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Until 3 December 2012 the Union flag flew over Belfast City Hall throughout the year. On that date the City Council decided that the flag should fly on certain designated days only. That decision sparked a wave of protests throughout Northern Ireland which continued for some months. The present appeal is concerned with those protests which took place in Belfast and the policing operations that were undertaken to deal with them.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">After 3 December 2012, the protests in Belfast quickly took on a pattern. Every week, protesters marched from a meeting point in East Belfast to Belfast City Hall which is located in the centre of the city. That route took them through part of the city known as Short Strand. Most residents in the Short Strand area are perceived to be nationalist. Those taking part in the processions were loyalists. When the protesters who had processed from East Belfast assembled at the City Hall, they were joined by others who had found their way to the city centre by other means. Some at least of these others joined the protesters from East Belfast on the march back after the protest. Considerable numbers were involved in the parade which passed through the Short Strand on its return to East Belfast, therefore. There was substantial violence and disorder as the parade went through that nationalist area. Sectarian abuse was directed at the residents of Short Strand; stones and other objects were thrown at them; and their homes were attacked. The appellant is a resident in Short Strand and his and his neighbours&#8217; homes have come under attack during the parades that took place during December 2012 and January 2013.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">On 4 December 2012 an initial decision was made that protesters should not be permitted to enter Belfast city centre on Saturday 8 December when, as police knew, a protest at the City Hall was planned. That decision had nothing to do with stopping a parade or march. It was taken because it was considered necessary to prevent disorder. It was felt that the &#8220;normal life&#8221; of the city centre should be maintained because of the number of families and other members of the public who would be gathered there &#8220;at a peak retail period&#8221;. The reputation of the city at a time when inward investment was being encouraged was also a consideration.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In the period between 6 and 8 December police reflected on this decision. That reflection led to a change of mind. In an entry of 7 December 2012 in an Event Policy Book maintained by PSNI, the change in decision was explained. It was considered that there was &#8220;a need to try and facilitate some form of protest at Belfast City Hall to allow for some venting of anger and [relief of] community tension on this issue&#8221;.</p>

This was called &#8220;Operation Dulcet&#8221; and its leader, designated Gold Commander, was Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr of PSNI. Chief Superintendent Alan McCrum was appointed Silver Commander. In a series of affidavits filed in these proceedings, Mr Kerr has described how the police developed and implemented plans to deal with the protest. In the first of these he suggested that police have &#8220;no specific power to ban a procession&#8221; under the relevant legislation. He stated that PSNI seeks to enforce conditions imposed by the Parades Commission or a prohibition order by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Such an order may be made by the Secretary of State under article 5(1) of the Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 (SI 1987/463 (NI 7)) in respect of open air public meetings. Significantly. Mr Kerr stated that &#8220;in the absence of either a Parades Commission determination or prohibition from the Secretary of State, PSNI can only have recourse to general public order policing powers&#8221;.</p>

Mr Kerr explained how this came about in para 17 of his second affidavit:</p>

In addition, the wish to have a break in time between the protests and the main marching season, the lack of any proper structure in the protests groups whereby an agreed cessation could be settled, the resource considerations in terms of our ability to manage and contain any problems associated with stopping the protests and the impact upon the residents of the Short Strand of the ongoing protests.&#8221;</p>

It is also intended to provide &#8220;advice on the interaction between the Parades Commission and PSNI&#8221;. The service procedure was issued on 31 March 2008 and amended and reissued on 9 June 2011. An event is defined in the procedure as including any event or incident ranging from routine operational policing through to major disorder requiring a degree of planning. When an event has been notified or the police become aware of an intended event, a strategy meeting is held. At the first such meeting an Event Policy Book is opened. Strategic decisions concerning the way in which an event is policed should be recorded in this book. These include major decisions which have an impact on an established strategy; major tactical decisions; any change in strategy; and any issue or decision which may have legal consequences not already addressed in the strategy plan.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">On 6 December 2012 Mr Kerr, in an email to police colleagues about the &#8220;movement of groups of protesters from various parts of the city towards Belfast City Hall&#8221;, referred to &#8220;the rights and presumptions (<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>) to peaceful protest, outlined in articles 9 to 11 of ECHR&#8221;. He pointed out that these were not absolute rights and that the degree of disorder experienced during protests on earlier evenings justified preventing &#8220;known groups of protesters (from either community)&#8221; from entering Belfast city centre. This was cited as an example of Mr Kerr&#8217;s appreciation that the police were entitled to stop unnotified processions or parades. It is plainly not that. To the contrary, the entire tenor of the email is directed towards the public order powers of the police to prevent disorder even where that takes place under the guise of the right to protest. The record of decision appearing in the Event Policy Book of the same date to the effect that a &#8220;Gold Direction&#8221; was issued to prevent large numbers of protesters moving towards the city centre prompts the same conclusion. It does not address the question of parades at all, much less the legal powers of police to stop them.</p>

As is clear from the record of decision in the Event Policy Book of 22 January 2013, instead of prompting PSNI to examine its legal powers to stop an unnotified parade, this led to a discussion between ACC Kerr and the Chief Constable that &#8220;the appropriate means and mechanism&#8221; to determine how the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act should be complied with was for PSNI and the Parades Commission to seek legal advice. It had been agreed between the chairman of the commission and Mr Kerr on 15 January 2013 that both sides should take advice. A letter from Chief Superintendent McCrum to the chairman of the commission on 19 January 2013 stated that un-notified processions that had been occurring every Saturday were likely to continue and that the commission might wish to take legal advice as to whether it &#8220;should be considering these in line with the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Public Processions (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/47" uk:canonical="1998 c. 47" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Northern Ireland) Act 1998</ref></ref>.&#8221; This was followed up by a letter in much the same terms on 23 January.</p>

On 13 February 2013, a record was made that Mr Kerr was considering whether judicial review proceedings should be brought on behalf of PSNI in order to obtain &#8220;clarity on powers under the Public Processions Act&#8221;.

PSNI did not behave in a proactive manner to arrest and prosecute those who were organising and participating in the parades. When he did come to consider police action to stop them, Mr Kerr wrongly believed, the judge held, that he was inhibited from doing so by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref>.

These were equivalent to the powers available to police when parade organisers and participants arrange and take part in parades where conditions imposed by the Parades Commission had not been observed - para 134 of his judgment. ACC Kerr&#8217;s purported distinction between the two scenarios was unsustainable, the judge said. &#8220;Whether a parade was unlawful by reason of breach of a Parades Commission determination or because of a decision to flout the notice requirement, should not have led to a different police response. In each case the expectation is that the police will seek to uphold the rule of law.&#8221; - para 135. The consequence of the police&#8217;s failure to appreciate the extent of their powers to deal with the criminal offences of organising and participating in non-notified parades had the effect, in the estimation of the judge, of undermining <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref>; it had led to a failure on the part of the police to act in accordance with their obligations under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/32/section/32" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 32</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/32" uk:canonical="2000 c. 32" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Police (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/1" uk:canonical="2000 c. 1" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Northern Ireland) Act 2000</ref></ref> and it gave rise to a violation of the appellant&#8217;s article 8 rights - para 137 of the judgment.</p>

That again was correct. He went on to indicate that police were faced with having to make decisions about the appropriate response to such parades on the basis of a risk or threat to life. We do not consider that any criticism can be made of that.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The difficulty with this passage is that it does not address the point that Treacy J had made. This was that, because ACC Kerr had not adverted to the provision in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref> which made it illegal to organise or participate in an unnotified parade (section 6(7)), and had failed to recognise that this provided police with the power (and, indeed, the duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/32/section/32" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 32</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/32" uk:canonical="2000 c. 32" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2000 Act</ref>) to prevent this particular species of criminal activity, the option of stopping the parade for that reason was not considered. Contrary to what the Lord Chief Justice said, the police <span style="font-style:italic">did </span>have power to stop an unnotified parade precisely because participating in such a parade was a criminal offence. Police have common law powers to prevent crime, quite apart from their duty to do so under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/32/section/32" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 32</ref>.</p>

Their concern was to prevent disorder in Belfast city centre and to stop protesters converging there.

That certainly was the intention of the North Committee. It is, however, agreed that there is no mechanism by which the Parades Commission can take decisions for unnotified parades. The management of such parades is the responsibility of the police on the basis of their general public order powers and their obligation to prevent crime including crimes under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref>.&#8221;</p>

Treacy J had raised the question (in para 129 of his judgment) of Mr Kerr having suggested that the Parades Commission take responsibility when, given that the commission had no role because of the lack of notification about the parades, the only agency that had the legal authority to stop the parade was PSNI. The circumstance that it had been the intention of the North Committee that the Parades Commission should be involved in the regulation of non-notified parades is not relevant to ACC Kerr&#8217;s attempt to persuade the Parades Commission to do what legally it could not. Trying to get the commission to intervene betokened a failure on the part of Mr Kerr to understand that it was the police, not the commission, who had responsibility under the law to prevent the parades from taking place.</p>

Ms Quinlivan QC, who appeared for the appellant, disputed both those statements. It is not possible to assess how detailed was the consideration before the judge of the various strategy documents etc. But it is abundantly clear (and not disputed by Mr McGleenan QC for the respondent) that the judge had seen the transcript of the interview.

The report was not solely concerned with the identity of the body that would take decisions about whether parades should be permitted to take place and under what conditions they ought to be allowed to proceed. Public order considerations, which were intrinsic to the operation of the police powers to control processions under the 1987 Order, were no longer to be the sole driver for determining whether and in what circumstances parades should be permitted to take place, although the report did recommend that the police should retain the power to intervene on public order grounds in &#8220;the extreme circumstances of the determination of the Parades Commission being defied&#8221; - Chapter 12 para 12.124 of the report. Generally, however, the report considered that putting emphasis on the question whether a particular parade might cause disorder ran the risk of rewarding threats that such disorder would take place. New criteria were required which should include the need to have regard to the impact that a parade would have on relationships within the community.</p>

It considered that in those circumstances the parades should be controlled by police using their public order powers. The problem for police, which the circumstances in this case demonstrate, is that the partial implementation of the North Report has left a larger cohort of parades outside the Parades Commission&#8217;s jurisdiction. In particular, the PSNI have to deal with unnotified parades using their available public order powers including the right of arrest in respect of the organisation or participation in such parades and the prevention of such unlawful parades in accordance with the duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/32/section/32" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 32</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/32" uk:canonical="2000 c. 32" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2000 Act</ref> to prevent crime.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is not clear why this should be regarded as a particular problem, at least in terms of police operational decisions. When the correct legal position is understood, namely that the police have power to stop parades to prevent disorder and to pre-empt breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2/section/6/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6(7)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref>, the police strategy and tactics in exercising those powers would have been similar, if not identical, to those which they would deploy to prevent a parade from proceeding in a manner which did not comply with a determination of the Parades Commission. Neither situation called on the police to form a judgment as to whether a parade <span style="font-style:italic">should </span>take place. What was required of them in both instances was a decision as to whether the parade was taking place legally. If it was not, either because it did not comply with a determination of the commission or because it had not been notified, their powers were, to all intents and purposes, the same. And the operational decisions should not have been any different, or, at least, certainly not on account of the fact that each parade contravened the law in different ways or that the source of the power of the police to stop the parade arose from different sections of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref>.</p>

It is important for the public authorities to show a certain degree of tolerance towards peaceful gatherings if the freedom of assembly guaranteed by article 11 of the Convention is not to be deprived of all substance (see <span style="font-style:italic">Nurettin Aldemir</span>, cited above, para 46).</p>

Prior notification serves not only the aim of reconciling, on the one hand, the right to assembly and, on the other hand, the rights and lawful interests (including the right of movement) of others, but also the prevention of disorder or crime. In order to balance these conflicting interests, the institution of preliminary administrative procedures is common practice in member states when a public demonstration is to be organised. In the Court&#8217;s view, such requirements do not, as such, run counter to the principles embodied in article 11 of the Convention, as long as they do not represent a hidden obstacle to the freedom of peaceful assembly protected by the Convention (see <span style="font-style:italic">Balcik v Turkey</span>, no 25/02, para 49, 29 November 2007).</p>

In particular, such derogation from the general rule may be justified if a delay would have rendered that response obsolete.&#8221;</p>

ECtHR has made it clear that, in general, a requirement to notify an intention to hold a parade and a decision to disperse a parade or protest which has not been notified will not infringe article 11. There was no warrant for allowing article 11 considerations to determine how these parades should be policed.</p>

In both propositions she is clearly right. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">The 1998 Act</ref> is the considered response of Parliament to the intractable problem of parades in Northern Ireland. Fundamental to its successful operation is the requirement that there be notification of parades, especially those which are likely to be contentious or to provoke disorder. The parades in this case were far from peaceful. The police had no obligation to facilitate them. To the contrary, they had an inescapable duty to prevent, where possible, what were plainly illegal parades from taking place and to protect those whose rights under article 8 of ECHR were in peril of being infringed. Meeting those obligations had to be tempered by operational constraints, of course. Stopping the parades without taking account of what further violence that might provoke was not an option. But the operational difficulties required to be assessed in the correct legal context. PSNI had to have a clear-sighted appreciation of their available powers and an equally percipient understanding of the fact that the Parades Commission had no power to intervene. I shall discuss this in more detail in the next section of this judgment.</p>

It is true, of course, that the Loyal Orange Order, in light of PSNI&#8217;s response to the unnotified parades, considered adopting a policy of not notifying the commission of intended parades, contrary to their previous practice of doing so. But that does not signify in the debate as to whether <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref> was in fact undermined.

One can understand why this might have been considered to be the dominant question.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The debate in the present case has centred on how judicial scrutiny of the policing decisions taken about these parades should be conducted. The appellant suggested that the discretion was circumscribed by the imperative of ensuring the full effectiveness of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref>. The area of discretion available to the police was also constrained by the positive obligation to protect the appellant&#8217;s article 8 rights, Ms Quinlivan argued. She claimed that policing decisions in this context had to satisfy a requirement of proportionality. In advancing this claim she relied on what had been said by Lord Carswell in <span style="font-style:italic">E v Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] AC 536" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] AC 536</ref>. That case was concerned with attempts by &#8220;loyalist&#8221; protesters in Belfast to prevent Catholic parents from taking their normal route on foot through a loyalist area to a Catholic girls&#8217; primary school. The appellant had challenged what she claimed was the failure of police to discharge their positive obligation to protect her and her daughter against the infliction upon them of inhuman and degrading treatment within the meaning of article 3 of ECHR. Having considered <span style="font-style:italic">R (Daly)v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 AC 532" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 AC 532</ref>, <span style="font-style:italic">Huang v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 2 AC 167" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 2 AC 167</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">R (SB)v Governors of Denbigh High School</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 AC 100" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 AC 100</ref>, Lord Carswell said this at para 54:</p>

It is true that the court did not refer to the question whether the police actions were proportionate but it appears to have accepted that the appellant&#8217;s article 8 rights were engaged and the Lord Chief Justice referred on more than one occasion to Lord Carswell&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">E </span>so it is difficult to conclude that he did not have the question of proportionality in mind.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Whatever of that, it seems to me that there is something of an air of unreality about discussing the question of proportionality given that PSNI had wrongly construed their powers under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1998/2" uk:canonical="1998 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1998 Act</ref> and the Court of Appeal failed to so find. Like so much else involved in judicial review of police actions, proportionality depends on context and PSNI had set themselves the wrong context in which to make decisions. Ms Quinlivan was therefore inclined to accept that a finding that the police had failed to recognise the true breadth and nature of their powers under the legislation would render discussion of the discretionary area of judgment less than central to the case. She was right to do so. What might be considered proportionate if the police view of the limits on their powers was correct might be considered not to be so if they had recognised the full panoply of controls that were in fact available. Discussion of what might have been proportionate in those circumstances is unlikely to be helpful. So too is speculation about what the police ought to have done if they had a proper understanding of the powers available to them.</p>

One may also say that police took an active and continuing approach to the question of how to deal with the parades. Many officers were injured in the course of policing the flags protest. Many participants were arrested and successfully prosecuted. Constant review of the proper tactical approach was undertaken.</p>

I do not understand him to suggest that this was the result of studied indifference or deliberate lack of response to the very difficult situation faced by the residents of Short Strand. The absence of a more proactive approach was due to a concatenation of unfortunate circumstances. These included the misunderstanding by PSNI of the powers available to them; their failure (at least in the early stages) to appreciate that the Parades Commission was powerless to intervene; a lack of insight into the central importance of ensuring that unnotified parades were not permitted to take place; the placing of too great an emphasis on the possible article 11 rights of protesters; and that the matter of controlling unnotified parades was legally complicated.</p>

The trial judge&#8217;s major role is the determination of fact, and with experience in fulfilling that role comes expertise. Duplication of the trial judge&#8217;s efforts in the court of appeals would very likely contribute only negligibly to the accuracy of fact determination at a huge cost in diversion of judicial resources. In addition, the parties to a case on appeal have already been forced to concentrate their energies and resources on persuading the trial judge that their account of the facts is the correct one; requiring them to persuade three more judges at the appellate level is requiring too much. As the court has stated in a different context, the trial on the merits should be &#8220;the &#8216;main event&#8217; &#8230; rather than a &#8216;tryout on the road.&#8217;&#8221; &#8230; For these reasons, review of factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard - with its deference to the trier of fact - is the rule, not the exception.&#8217;</span></p>

On one view, the situation is different where factual findings and the inferences drawn from them are made on the basis of affidavit evidence and consideration of contemporaneous documents.

A first instance judgment provides a template on which criticisms are focused and the assessment of factual issues by an appellate court can be a very different exercise in the appeal setting than during the trial. Impressions formed by a judge approaching the matter for the first time may be more reliable than a concentration on the inevitable attack on the validity of conclusions that he or she has reached which is a feature of an appeal founded on a challenge to factual findings. The case for reticence on the part of the appellate court, while perhaps not as strong in a case where no oral evidence has been given, remains cogent. In the present appeal, I consider that the Court of Appeal should have evinced a greater reluctance in reversing the judge&#8217;s findings than they appear to have done.</p>
