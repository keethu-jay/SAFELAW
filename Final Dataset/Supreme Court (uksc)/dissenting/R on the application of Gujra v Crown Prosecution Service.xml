	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Director of Public Prosecutions (&#8220;the Director&#8221;) has power to take over a private prosecution and thereupon to discontinue it. In determining whether to do so, it is his policy to apply certain criteria. This appeal concerns his first criterion, which relates to the strength of the evidence in support of the prosecution. Prior to 2009 the Director asked himself whether the evidence clearly failed to disclose a case sufficient for the defendant to be called upon to answer it. If his conclusion was that it clearly failed to do so, he took over the prosecution and discontinued it; otherwise, and subject to the application of further criteria, he declined to take it over. But in 2009 he changed his policy in relation to the evidential criterion. It became his policy to take over a private prosecution and to discontinue it unless the evidence was such as to render the prosecution more likely to result in a conviction than not to do so. Although one could refer to it as the &#8220;51% chance test&#8221; or the &#8220;greater than even chance test&#8221;, I will refer to the current criterion as the &#8220;reasonable prospect test&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Gujra, the appellant, instituted two private prosecutions. The Director, acting by the Crown Prosecution Service (&#8220;the CPS&#8221;), concluded that the evidence in support of them was not such as to satisfy the reasonable prospect test. So, applying his current policy, he took them over and thereupon discontinued them. It is agreed that, had he applied his previous policy, he would not have done so. The appellant applied for judicial review of his decision to do so and, specifically, for an order that it be quashed. On 9 March 2011 the Divisional Court of the Queen&#8217;s Bench Division (Richards LJ and Edwards-Stuart J) dismissed the application: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2011/472" uk:canonical="[2011] EWHC 472 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 472 (Admin)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] 1 WLR 254" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] 1 WLR 254</ref>. In this appeal the appellant&#8217;s central contention is that the Director&#8217;s current policy is unlawful because it improperly restricts the statutory right of a citizen to bring a private prosecution.</p>

By his information, the appellant alleged that on 17 May 2010 the brothers had jointly perpetrated a common assault upon him. His case was and is that he was sitting outside a caf&#233; with two friends; that the brothers drove up and got out of the car; that one of them punched him, as a result of which he fell to the ground; and that both of them kicked him. There is no doubt that the police were called; that he complained to them that the brothers had assaulted him; and that the police noticed that he had sustained injuries, albeit that they considered them to be very minor.</p>

By his information, the appellant alleged that on 24 May 2010 the third brother had, with intent, used threatening words towards him, thereby causing him alarm, contrary to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/64/section/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 4</ref>A of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/64" uk:canonical="1986 c. 64" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Public Order Act 1986</ref>. His case was and is that the brother approached him while he was sitting in his car; called him &#8220;a dirty grass&#8221; and, in reference to his caste, &#8220;a dirty patra&#8221;; and threatened to kill him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant promptly consulted solicitors about a possible private prosecution referable to both these alleged incidents; but the police also launched an investigation into the alleged assault. Late in May 2010 the appellant made statements both to his solicitors and to the police. Although to the officer at the scene they had denied having witnessed the alleged assault, his two friends also made statements to his solicitors and to the police, in which they claimed to have witnessed it and, broadly, confirmed the accuracy of his account of it. The appellant referred to the later incident in his statement to his solicitors but not in his statement to the police, who learnt of it only when they received a copy of the former statement. He did not suggest that anyone had witnessed the later incident. In his statements the appellant explained that he had sworn an affidavit in support of a claim in civil proceedings brought by a third party against Mr Imran Mirza and Mr Wajeed Mirza; and he suggested that the incidents had been by way of revenge.</p>

When the CPS learnt of their institution, the focus of its review became whether to take over their conduct in order either to continue or to discontinue them. The review was entrusted to Mr Massey, a senior officer in the Complex Casework Unit of the Wessex CPS.</p>

In his review Mr Massey set out in detail his reasons for concluding that the evidence in support of each of the two private prosecutions failed to satisfy the reasonable prospect test. In accordance with the current policy of the CPS when taking over a private prosecution, Mr Massey&#8217;s review was submitted to Miss Levitt QC, its Principal Legal Adviser, who, on 9 November 2010, endorsed his conclusion. The Chief Crown Prosecutor for Hampshire thereupon directed that conduct of the prosecutions should be taken over in order that they should be discontinued. On 16 November 2010 the CPS duly notified the magistrates&#8217; court pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23/section/23/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23(3)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Prosecution of Offences Act 1985</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref>&#8221;) that the Director did not want the prosecutions to continue; and they were thereby discontinued. It also notified the appellant and the three defendants, by their respective solicitors, of the discontinuance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Until late in the 19th century prosecutions were brought almost entirely by the victims of the alleged crimes or, if they were dead, by their kinsmen. Local parish constables, not organised on any national or even regional basis and not even paid, sometimes helped the victims to prosecute. By about 1730, if they could afford it, prosecutors and defendants sometimes engaged lawyers to represent them. At around the same time associations of people with a common, sectional, interest in prosecuting particular felonies sprang up in order to conduct prosecutions on behalf of their members. But, as late as 1816, Chitty, in <span style="font-style:italic">A Practical Treatise on The Criminal Law</span> 1st ed (1816), vol 1, p 1 wrote:</p>

He also had a long-standing prerogative power to halt any prosecution in a court of record by entering a nolle prosequi, of which, in modern times, he makes rare use, indeed usually only when he considers that the defendant is unfit to plead.</p>

It was the Metropolitan Police Act of that year (10 Geo 4, c 44) and it established the London Metropolitan Police. It was followed in 1856 by the County and Borough Police Act (19 &amp; 20 Vict, c 69), which required every county and borough to have its own constabulary. This improvement in the organisation of the police seems to have been the spur to their assumption of responsibility for most prosecutions. Technically, however, the prosecuting police officer was just another private prosecutor.</p>

But the Prosecution of Offences Act 1879 (42 &amp; 43 Vict c 22) went only a small way towards it. It established the role of the Director, under the direction of the Attorney General, but in effect it provided for him to institute prosecutions only in cases of importance or difficulty.

Its central recommendation was that there should be a statutory prosecution service for all 43 police force areas in England and Wales, based locally but with national co-ordinating features; and that the police should conduct the prosecution (and its preliminaries) only to the point of charge or of the issue of the summons, whereafter the prosecution service should decide whether to proceed and, if so, should assume conduct of the prosecution. There was, so the Commission observed at paras 6.5 and 6.6 of the report, a lack of pattern in the existing prosecuting system in that it was not uniformly organised and administered across the 43 areas, with the result that the arrangements were characterised by variety and haphazardness.</p>

It approved this test and, at para 8.9, recommended that it &#8220;should be extended to all cases, and applied by all who make the decisions that bring a case to court&#8221;. &#8220;Someone should not be put on trial&#8221;, observed the Commission, &#8220;if it can be predicted, with some confidence, that he is more likely than not to be acquitted, since it is both unfair to the accused and a waste of the restricted resources of the criminal justice system.&#8221;</p>

Paras 4.5 and 4.6 provide that the evidential stage is passed if the evidence is sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, namely that the court is more likely than not to convict the defendant. In relation to the public interest stage, para 4.12 provides that a prosecution will usually take place unless the prosecutor is sure that public interest factors tending against prosecution outweigh those tending in favour; and examples of factors which tend in each direction are given at paras 4.16 and 4.17.</p>

There was no suggestion in that case that, pursuant to his policy, the Director should intervene in the private prosecution, which the trade body had proceeded to institute, in order to discontinue it. That was because the CPS had decided not that it would be contrary to the public interest for the claimants to be prosecuted at all but only that it would be contrary to the public interest for a prosecution to be conducted by itself: see the judgment of Leveson LJ (with which Ward LJ and I agreed) at paras 12, 39 and 51.</p>

Such prosecutions are still frequently instituted. The great majority survive his three current tests for intervention and discontinuance; they therefore proceed as private prosecutions or, occasionally, as prosecutions which he takes over and continues. Other public bodies, such as the Office of Fair Trading which prosecutes those who practise wrongful forms of selling, and Transport for London which prosecutes evaders of fares, apply the reasonable prospect test. So does the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, a private registered charity, the target of whose prosecutions is self-evident. Retail companies often prosecute shop-lifters and, although there is no firm evidence before this court as to the evidential test which they apply in determining whether to do so, the CPS seems not to intervene and, indeed, to be more than content thus to be spared entry into that sphere of prosecution. Other private bodies who sometimes conduct private prosecutions are identified in an illuminating article by Dr LH Leigh entitled <span style="font-style:italic">Private prosecutions and diversionary justice</span> in the Criminal Law Review: [2007] Crim LR 289, 293-294. Then there is the residue of prosecutions brought by individual citizens, often (as in this case) for alleged assaults upon them, which survive the CPS tests or of which, indeed, the CPS never comes to learn.</p>

By way of application of his old policy, the Director had declined to conclude that there was clearly no case for the officers to answer. Save in one irrelevant respect, their applications for judicial review failed. The Divisional Court rejected their contention that, in determining whether to intervene, the Director had appraised the evidence by reference to criteria which were insufficiently stringent or had applied them too rigidly. The officers did not go so far as to submit that the only lawful course open to the Director would have been to apply the criteria in the Code. But in his judgment, with which the other members of the court agreed, Laws LJ made observations about any such submission, upon which, in support of the present appeal, the strongest reliance is placed. Laws LJ said, at p 68:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;In truth, however, it could not be right for the DPP to apply across the board the same tests, in particular the &#8216;reasonable prospect of conviction&#8217; test..., in considering whether to take over and discontinue a private prosecution as the Code enjoins Crown Prosecutors to follow in deciding whether to institute or proceed with a prosecution themselves; the consequence would be that the DPP would stop a private prosecution merely on the ground that the case is not one which he would himself proceed with. But that, in my judgment, would amount to an emasculation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/60/section/6/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6(1)</ref> and itself be an unlawful policy; and in fairness [counsel for the officers] made it clear that he did not submit so much. The very premise of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1984/60/section/6/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6(1)</ref> must be that some cases will go to trial which the DPP himself chooses not to prosecute.&#8221;</p>

The coherence lay, so it is said, in the fact that, subject of course to the difference between a survey of the written evidence and that of the oral evidence, the Director formerly asked himself in effect precisely the same question as the court would ask itself in ruling on a submission at the close of the prosecution case: is there a case for the defendant to answer? This argument, which finds favour in the judgment of Lord Mance at paras 98, 99 and 114 below, makes limited appeal to me. Much more relevant to the aptness of a prosecution than whether it is likely to survive a submission of no case to answer is whether it is likely to result in a conviction. In focussing, as his current policy does, on the prospects of a private prosecution in that regard, the Director in my view poses to himself a much more relevant question.</p>

Efficacy, so the appellant argues, should in that way be given to such reasonable conclusion about the strength of the evidence as the private prosecutor may have reached. The CPS itself reminds the court that &#8220;in deciding whether a prosecution is required in the public interest, prosecutors should take into account any views expressed by the victim regarding the impact that the offence has had&#8221;: the Code, para 4.18; and the appellant thus argues for loosely analogous consideration of the views of the victim in relation to the evidential stage of the Director&#8217;s inquiry.</p>

Mr Fitzgerald put the issue slightly differently, namely, as reflected in Lord Mance&#8217;s judgment, whether the 2009 policy emasculated (or, to use Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s words, unlawfully attenuated, restricted or diminished) the right to conduct private prosecutions. In my view, a policy which emasculated the right would indeed frustrate the policy and objects of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23/section/6" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6</ref>, so I consider that there is, in principle and in practice, no real difference between the approach of Lord Wilson and that of Lord Mance.</p>

However, I consider that, in the absence of any argument in this court or below to the contrary, we must proceed on the basis that the policy is lawful. Quite apart from the presumption of legality, it seems to me hard to quarrel with a policy that a prosecution will not be initiated or conducted by the Director unless the two requirements, set out and explained in the Code, are met, namely (i) there is a better than evens prospect of securing a conviction, and (ii) it would be in the public interest to proceed with the prosecution.</p>

While I am far from suggesting that the &#8220;better than evens&#8221; standard is the only one which the Director could adopt, there are several reasons for the first requirement. (i) It could be said to be oppressive on potential defendants to require them to face criminal proceedings unless there was a good chance of securing a conviction. (ii) Court time should not normally be taken up dealing with speculative prosecutions. (iii) Public money on prosecuting, and defending, criminal proceedings should generally be devoted to cases which are likely to be successful. And, perhaps more arguably, (iv) a low conviction rate may undermine confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>

However, there are four factors which seem to me to provide support for the contention that the Director is justified in adopting the same &#8220;better than evens&#8221; standard for private prosecutions as he applies under the Code to his own prosecutions.</p>

Accordingly, at least on the face of it, it would seem hard to say that for him to adopt a consistent approach to public and private prosecutions was contrary to what was contemplated by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref>.</p>

In such a case, it seems to me that he would be entitled to apply the Code to the case, and discontinue, particularly given that there is a continuing obligation on the Director under the Code to review any prosecution. If that is right, there is obvious logic in his applying the same standard when considering a private prosecution, given his power to take over its conduct in order to discontinue it.</p>

(i) Unfairness to defendants and (ii) use of court time apply to the same extent. (iii) Costs implications substantially apply to a similar extent, although unsuccessful private prosecutors will not always be reimbursed out of public funds. (iv) Confidence in the justice system may be rather less relevant, because the Director&#8217;s record will not be affected, but, given the applicability of the other three factors, it still applies to a significant extent.</p>

His case in this connection is that, while private prosecutions would not be wiped out by the 2009 policy, the right to conduct such prosecutions would be so substantially reduced as to be emasculated. He reinforced that argument by pointing out that it has to be judged bearing in mind that the right to bring a private prosecution is an aspect of a fundamental common law right, namely the right of every citizen to enjoy access to the courts.</p>

Accordingly, in any case where the Director has not got round to deciding whether to prosecute, or has considered the facts and has decided not to prosecute, a private prosecution could be initiated. If that prosecution comes to the Director&#8217;s attention, he will then have to assess, or, if he has already done so, to reassess, whether there is a better than evens prospect of the prosecution succeeding, and whether it is in the public interest that it proceed: if both those tests are satisfied, the prosecution will be permitted to proceed (either because the Director takes it over or as a private prosecution). That, of itself, gives the right to initiate private prosecutions an undoubted, indeed a virtually unlimited, function.</p>

However, it is also apparent from the 2009 policy that there will be prosecutions which the Director will not take over, and will allow to proceed as private prosecutions, even if one ignores the prosecutions which the Director effectively leaves to large concerns &#8211; as described by Lord Wilson at para 33.</p>

Thus, any private prosecution which is found to have a better than evens chance of success and is not contrary to the public interest, will be permitted to continue as a private prosecution save where there is &#8220;a particular need&#8221; for it to be taken over by the Director.</p>

Albeit by way of non-exhaustive, and non-conclusive, examples, the 2009 policy suggests that private prosecutions should normally be taken over by the Director if &#8220;the offence is serious&#8221;, if &#8220;there are detailed disclosure issues to resolve&#8221;, or if the prosecution would involve &#8220;the disclosure of highly sensitive material&#8221; or &#8220;applications for special measures or for witness anonymity&#8221;.</p>

The right to conduct a private prosecution has always been subject to being curtailed by the power of the Attorney General to stop the prosecution through issuing a <span style="font-style:italic">nolle prosequi</span> &#8211; an executive power which, unsurprisingly, has no equivalent in the civil jurisdiction.</p>

However, that does not really impinge on the lawfulness of the Director applying a &#8220;better than evens&#8221; test to private prosecutions.

I find it hard to see what is wrong with a policy that a private prosecution should be allowed to proceed as such, only if (i) it has a greater than evens chance of success, (ii) it is not contrary to the public interest, and (iii) there is no special reason why it should be conducted by the Director.</p>

Ancillary to this is the power to discontinue such a prosecution. The use of these powers involves the exercise of discretion. A person or agency who is exercising discretion as to how to use a statutory power may devise a policy to guide him in its use. He may formulate a policy or make a limiting rule as to the future exercise of his discretion, if he thinks that good administration requires it, provided that he listens to any applicant who has something new to say: <span style="font-style:italic">British Oxygen Co Ltd v Board of Trade</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1971] AC 610" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1971">[1971] AC 610</ref>, 624G-625E. He must also ensure that the terms of the policy are readily available to those who are likely to be affected by its application. Beyond this, however, the only constraint on the exercise of his discretion is that it must not defeat or frustrate the policy of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> from which it is derived: <span style="font-style:italic">Padfield v Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">and Food</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1968] AC 997" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1968">[1968] AC 997</ref>.

Lord Mance suggests that it derives from an access to justice principle, rooted in fundamental constitutional theory. Lady Hale says that this is a &#8220;centuries-old &#8230; right of access to a court to prosecute an alleged offender&#8221;: para 123. But it is clear that the right, however venerable, has been modified by successive enactments. The very institution of the office of Director of Public Prosecutions impinged on the right. Prosecution of offenders was no longer exclusively in the domain of private individuals. Adjustment to the content of the right was therefore inevitable. The Director was given the power to stop private prosecutions. On whatever basis that power was exercised previously, the right to privately prosecute was affected.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Moreover, access to justice is not, in any event, always an unqualified right of the citizen. In judicial review, for instance, the leave of the court to take proceedings is required. And it is undeniable that private prosecutions may still be &#8211; and are regularly &#8211; taken. As Lord Neuberger has pointed out, Mr Fitzgerald QC for the appellant accepted that for the Director to stop a private prosecution on the ground that the case is not one which he would himself proceed with would not, in the words of Laws LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Director of Public Prosecutions Ex p Duckenfield</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 WLR 55" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 WLR 55</ref>, 68, amount to an emasculation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23/section/6/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6(1)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref>, in the sense of extinguishing it. The change of policy has, of course, attenuated the right that had previously existed, as Mr Fitzgerald correctly contended. But this would not be the first instance of its attenuation. Access of the citizen to justice in the field of private prosecution is therefore not denied by the Director&#8217;s change of policy. It is adjusted certainly. The essential question, however, is whether this adjustment is out of keeping with the underlying policy and objects of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref>.</p>

I do not consider it necessary for me to say anything about those beyond observing that the question whether it is lawful for the Director to change his policy is not necessarily answered by asking whether Parliament intended, by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref>, to curtail the right of the citizen to institute private prosecutions. It is clear that Parliament intended that the Director should have power to take over a private prosecution with a view to discontinuing it. Parliament&#8217;s intention must be viewed against the background of the historical adjustment to the right to privately prosecute. That adjustment occurred because the Director was given the power to take over private prosecutions and because of the way in which he decided to exercise that power. Parliament&#8217;s intention in 1985 was clearly to preserve the power and, it seems to me, its intention must also have contemplated that the policy by which the power might be exercised could be subject to change. Parliament may not have intended positively to restrict the right of citizens to institute private prosecutions but that does not mean that it had reached a settled intention that that right should remain precisely in the condition that, as a result of the then current policy of the Director, it then was.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The conferring of a power on the Director to take over the conduct of a private prosecution, without prescription as to when and in what circumstances that power might be exercised, can only be regarded as consistent with a Parliamentary intention that the power <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> be exercised so as to assimilate the test for private prosecutions with that which the Director applied to the conduct of public prosecutions. After all, Parliament leaves to the Director the choice of the test as to when a public prosecution should proceed or be discontinued. Why should it be thought that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref> intended to preserve in aspic the test that had been in use at that particular time in respect of private prosecutions? There was, at least, lively debate about the value of the right to privately prosecute at the time of the passing of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref>. If Parliament had intended that the right to conduct private prosecutions &#8211; or, more accurately, the right to prevent their being taken over by the Director in order to discontinue them &#8211; should be maintained in the condition that it was permitted to exist by the then current policy of the Director, it would surely have been necessary to make this unequivocally clear. The right to instigate and continue private prosecutions had been subject to change before <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref>. Most importantly, it had been subject to the policy of the Director that the prosecution evidence be sufficient to sustain a prima facie case. There was no reason to suppose that this policy would remain in an inviolate and immutable condition.</p>

That is a phrase familiar in other areas of the law and it sounds as if it should be beyond controversy until one appreciates that it is defined in this area to require a conclusion, before any prosecution, that &#8220;an objective, impartial and reasonable jury or bench of magistrates or judge hearing a case alone, properly directed and acting in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged&#8221; (Code, para 4.6). This stage therefore imposes a substantially higher threshold for public prosecution than any criminal court would apply.

It had recommended that a private prosecution should only be brought after application to a Crown prosecutor, who would apply the same criteria as he would apply to any other prosecution in deciding whether to take the case on, and that, if the Crown prosecutor decided not to take it on, the private person should be able to apply to a magistrate&#8217;s court for leave to commence proceedings.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">That approach follows from general principle. Parliament legislates against the background of rights which the common law treats as fundamental or constitutional. Legislation is to be construed as displacing such rights only so far as it contains clear and specific provision to this effect: see eg <span style="font-style:italic">R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Pierson</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1998] AC 539" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1998">[1998] AC 539</ref>, 587C-G and 591E-F. The principle is very relevant when considering the extent to which the general power to &#8220;take over [the] conduct&#8221; of a private prosecution conferred by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23/section/6/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref> embraces the power to take over proceedings for which there is a proper evidential basis and to which no public policy objection can be raised, not in order to pursue them but in order to bring them to an end, simply because, in the Director&#8217;s own paper assessment, the proceedings are more likely than not to fail, applying the test set out in para 106 above. Its relevance is heightened by (a) the inherent limitations of any evidential assessment on paper of the prospects of criminal conviction, (b) the fact that in another person&#8217;s equally reasonable assessment the proceedings may well be more likely than not to succeed and (c) the role of private prosecutions, as a type of democratic long-stop or safety valve, in enabling complainants whose case is that they <span style="font-style:italic">know</span> that they have been victims of serious offending to bring the matter before a criminal court, in circumstance where public prosecutors have on balance assessed their case as lacking sufficient evidential strength.</p>

First, when (and if) the CPS &#8220;finds out about a private prosecution&#8221;, it &#8220;should take over and continue with the prosecution&#8221; if both limbs are clearly shown and &#8220;there is a particular need for the CPS to take over the prosecution&#8221;. Secondly, a private prosecution &#8220;should be taken over and stopped if, upon review of the case papers, either the evidential sufficiency stage or the public interest stage of the Full Code Test is not met&#8221;, and, even then, it may be necessary to do this &#8220;where there is a particular need to do so, such as where the prosecution is likely to damage the interests of justice&#8221;. One would have thought that this last situation and the examples given (which include situations such as that where the prosecution interferes with the investigation or prosecution of another criminal charge or is vexatious) would all lead to failure at the second, public interest stage of the Full Code Test, but that is presently unimportant. Finally, a private prosecution should not be taken over &#8220;if the papers clearly show&#8221; that both stages of the Full Code Test are met, and there is no particular need for the CPS to take over the prosecution.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Under the language of the Code, as Miss Montgomery accepted, the CPS is obliged to prosecute all cases satisfying the two stages of the Full Code Test. The policy adopted in 2009 therefore leaves no room for private prosecutions, except in cases where a private prosecutor starts proceedings before the CPS does, and the CPS decides to allow the private prosecutor to continue. The only value in the right to institute a private prosecution would, on this basis, consist in the fact that it would avoid having to take other means (eg judicial review) to stimulate the CPS into action and would, perhaps, in a few specific situations prevent a time limit for bringing a criminal charge from passing, before the CPS could be stimulated into action. Further, a considerable number of statutes expressly require that the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions to any prosecution brought under their provisions. The statutes range alphabetically from The <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/10" uk:canonical="1953 (1 &amp; 2 Eliz. 2) c. 10" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Agricultural Land (Removal of Surface Soil) Act 1953</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/10/section/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 3</ref> to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/69" uk:canonical="1981 c. 69" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/69/section/28" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 28</ref>. Such consent may be given by any Crown Prosecutor on the Director&#8217;s behalf: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Prosecution of Offenders Act 1985</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23/section/1/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 1(7)</ref>. Under para 3.7 of the Code, &#8220;the DPP or prosecutors acting on his behalf apply the Code in deciding whether to give consent to a prosecution&#8221;. A justification traditionally advanced for such consent requirements is the prevention of inappropriate prosecutions: see The Law Commission Report on Consents to Prosecution 1998 (LC 255), paras 3.17 to 3.22. The Director&#8217;s new policy relating to private prosecutions in effect equates all private prosecutions with prosecutions which are by statute specifically made subject to his consent. The difference is that consent has to be given in advance where a statute specifically requires consent, whereas in relation to other private prosecutions it is given only retrospectively as and when the Director (or CPS) learns of such a prosecution and acquiesces in its continuation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In these circumstances, Miss Montgomery developed in her oral submissions an alternative (and inconsistent) case. This was that, while assimilation was intended and appropriate in relation to the evidential test, it was not called for in relation to public policy; and, on this basis, there could be circumstances in which a private prosecutor could institute and pursue proceedings which the CPS would not regard as being in the public interest. This alternative hybrid finds no support in the actual language of the Code and the 2009 policy. It is as regards public policy consistent with <span style="font-style:italic">Scopelight</span>, but as regards the evidential test inconsistent with <span style="font-style:italic">Duckenfield</span>. It involves the strange proposition that a private prosecutor is free to take a different view from the Director and CPS on matters of public policy, but not free to take a different view on the effect of the available evidence. I note in parenthesis that it is also inconsistent with the Scottish position indicated in <span style="font-style:italic">X v Sweeney</span> 1982 JC 70, where the Lord Advocate had declined (and foregone the right) to prosecute on grounds of evidential weakness (the mental state of a claimed victim of rape), but a later date the victim, having recovered, petitioned for leave to bring a private prosecution.

The Director could be expected to be a good judge of these, which may (as where harm to national interests is involved or where the defendant has already suffered regulatory, civil or social consequences) be non-justiciable. But evidential weakness, without more, is a matter on which the courts have developed their own clear policy and is a quite different matter. Litigants are not to be shut out from access to justice to pursue cases which they are otherwise on the face of it entitled to pursue unless such cases cannot reasonably hope to succeed. That is the test which the Director, like all his predecessors, applied until 2009. In my opinion, he exceeded his properly interpreted power under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23/section/6/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 6(2)</ref> when in 2009 he departed from that long-standing policy.</p>

It is quite a different thing to impose it on private prosecutions. The Law Commission in its 1998 report, <span style="font-style:italic">Consents to Prosecution</span>, noted that private prosecutions were likely to be instituted which failed one or other of the evidential and public interest tests applied by the CPS (para 5.19), but also noted that it was regarded as an important safeguard for some members of society who believed that an individual prosecutor had misjudged the evidence in a case (para 5.4). It did not regard the fundamental right to institute a private prosecution as undermined by the harm that might result from an unsuccessful prosecution of an innocent defendant or from any prosecution not in the public interest, for three reasons (para 5.22), which I set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Jones v Whalley</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2007] 1 AC 63" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2007">[2007] 1 AC 63</ref>, para 42. They were (1) &#8220;a risk that an individual Crown prosecutor will either misapply the Code or - more likely, given the width of the Code tests - apply a personal interpretation to the tests which, although not wrong, might differ from that of other prosecutors&#8221;, (2) the perception in the eyes of some that the code may fail to achieve a proper balance and then this significant reason:</p>

If, for example, a case is turned down by the CPS because it fails the evidential sufficiency test, but only just; if the private prosecutor knows that the defendant is guilty (because, say, he or she was the victim and can identify the offender); and if the case is a serious one, then a private prosecution might be thought desirable.&#8221;</p>

Private prosecution is, and I think always has been, a safeguard against the feelings of injustice that can arise when, in the eyes of the public, public authorities do not pursue criminal investigations and proceedings in a manner which leads to culprits being brought before a criminal court. The impunity which offenders appear to enjoy can be socially detrimental. This is, as the Law Commission rightly said, particularly so in those cases where a victim actually knows that the offence has been committed but finds that a CPS prosecutor does not think on a balance of likelihood that his evidence, if given orally in court, will be accepted. The feeling of injustice will be particularly acute, if (as is accepted, but is in any event clear, on the facts of the present case) the CPS prosecutor&#8217;s decision was a fine one, and the alleged victims or another prosecutor might equally reasonably have concluded that the case was one in which the evidential test was satisfied.</p>

They underline the radical nature of the change purported to be introduced on a blanket basis by the policy issued in 2009. I am prepared to assume, though there is no evidence for this in the policy itself or the papers (and little support for it under the Code in the general words of clause 2.3 which Lord Wilson cites in para 22), that the CPS would recognise that it should be prepared to depart from that policy in particular exceptional cases (see <span style="font-style:italic">British Oxygen Co Ltd v Board of Trade</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1971] AC 610" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1971">[1971] AC 610</ref>, 625C-F).

It does however set out in general terms a number of considerations as the rationale for the change. These included the costs to society and those involved of a failed trial procedure and a suggested &#8220;obvious need&#8221; to ensure that cases were not brought where there is insufficient evidence and &#8220;little prospect of conviction&#8221; (witness statement of Alex Solomon, of the CPS&#8217;s Strategy and Policy Directorate). But these are all considerations inherent in the right of access to a court, which the court controls only by eliminating cases that could not reasonably lead to conviction. The obvious need to eliminate cases where a reasonable jury, bench or judge could reasonably convict is not one which has ever occurred to courts, or which occurred to the Director, whose policy was the exact opposite until 2009.</p>

As an assertion, this begs the question, particularly in the light of decades, if not centuries, during which the distinction has been accepted as natural. For the reasons I have given and as confirmed by the authorities to this day, there are significant differences between private and public prosecutions. The differences are of principle and they arise from the constitutional status of the right to institute a private prosecution and of the right of access to the courts for that purpose. Private prosecutions cannot axiomatically be submitted, or taken over in order to be submitted, to whatever the Director may adopt as the appropriate evidential and public policy tests for the purposes of prosecutions which he himself initiates. It is not relevant on this appeal to consider the special case (probably very unusual) of a prosecution taken over by the Director on public policy grounds with the intention of pursuing it to trial, but in relation to which the CPS later concluded in the light of newly discovered material that the evidential test was no longer met. That special case does not arise here. Assuming that the Director would in such a case be entitled to apply his own evidential test, that does not throw any light on the scope of the Director&#8217;s power to take over a private prosecution with a view to discontinuance. Finally, though as a lesser consideration, at a practical level there also appears to me to be a considerable difference between the pursuit by the CPS at public expense of a prosecution and the pursuit by a private person of a prosecution at his own cost in terms of time, as well as at his own expense subject to the court&#8217;s power under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23/section/17" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 17</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/23" uk:canonical="1985 c. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1985 Act</ref> to order reasonable compensation in respect of any expenses properly incurred in respect of proceedings for an indictable offence or in respect of a summary offence before a Divisional Court or the Supreme Court.</p>

In the light of what I have already said, the possibility of two reasonable views is a strong reason why the right of private prosecution remains a valuable constitutional right, which is not to be taken as affected by a heightened evidential test well in excess of any that a criminal court would apply, in the absence of specific statutory authority. But, if what I have already said is to be rejected (as is I understand the view of the majority in this court), then I would align myself emphatically with Lady Hale&#8217;s further observations in her paras 131 to 133.

I have considerable sympathy with the view that the CPS&#8217;s assessment in this case was a harsh judgment, picking up small points and supposed but barely significant discrepancies in relation to charges which would ultimately have depended on an overall judgment on credibility, and would have been supported to a large extent by hard evidence, including in some measure injuries difficult to attribute to anything other than deliberate actions by the alleged offenders who were clearly identified by three persons as being at the scene and responsible for assault on 17 May 2010 and made no comment when interviewed under caution. I should add that I am not entirely convinced that the CPS applied even its own test correctly, in the sense which Lady Hale identifies in paras 126, 128 and 129 and which I have identified in para 98 above; although the relevant CPS review starts by setting out that test in full (para 6), it later describes it as a &#8220;more likely than not to convict&#8221; test (paras 7.1) and thereafter refers simply to the question as being whether there is &#8220;a realistic prospect of conviction&#8221; and to the court being &#8220;unlikely [to] be satisfied of guilt&#8221; (paras 7.4, 8 and 10). However, having regard to the views I have already expressed and which others hold, it is unnecessary for me to say more on these aspects.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree entirely with the judgment of Lord Mance and, like him, I would allow this appeal. For the reasons he gives, I cannot accept that it was the intention of Parliament, when setting up the Crown Prosecution Service in 1985, to allow the Director to reduce the centuries-old right of private prosecution almost to vanishing point: in effect, to a right to pursue those prosecutions which the CPS are content to have pursued but would prefer to have pursued by some-one else. Like him, I consider that the right of access to a court to prosecute an alleged offender is as much a constitutional right as a right of access to a court to bring a civil claim. The power to cut down that right in such a drastic manner could only be conferred by clear words and not by the repetition of very general words, especially when those very general words had previously been thought by all concerned to do no such thing.</p>

At the very least, in my view, this court should have acceded to the alternative case advanced by Mr Fitzgerald on the claimant&#8217;s behalf.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The essential difference between the evidential tests applied by the courts and by the CPS relates to the likelihood of a witness being believed. The courts ask themselves: &#8216;Is the evidence capable of being believed? If it is, and the jury or magistrates believe it, is it sufficient to prove the case? Is there, in other words, a case to answer?&#8217; It is for the jury, judge or magistrates to decide whether they do in fact believe the witness. The CPS, on the other hand, ask themselves how likely it is that the witness will be believed. At least, that is what it looked as though the prosecutor was doing in this case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">However, it is not quite as straightforward as that. There is more than one view of how the evidential stage of the CPS test is supposed to work. As Lord Mance explains in paragraph 98 a &#8216;realistic prospect of success&#8217; is defined in the Code as where &#8216;an objective, impartial and reasonable jury, bench of magistrates or judge, properly directed and acting in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged&#8217;. Presumably, therefore, the reference to a &#8216;reasonable&#8217; jury is designed to allow certain types of case to proceed even though it is well-known that juries find it difficult to convict. With all due respect to Lord Neuberger, it cannot be a simple &#8216;better than evens&#8217; or &#8216;is a conviction more likely than not?&#8217; test. As Toulson LJ pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">R (B) v Director of Public Prosecutions (Equality and Human Rights Commission intervening)</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/admin/ch/2009/106" uk:canonical="[2009] EWHC 106 (Admin)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] EWHC 106 (Admin)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2009] 1 WLR 2072" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] 1 WLR 2072</ref>, para 50, if a prosecutor were to adopt this so-called &#8216;bookmaker&#8217;s approach&#8217; then few allegations of so-called &#8216;date rape&#8217; would be allowed to proceed. The same could be said of complaints brought by children or mentally ill or disabled people. It was suggested in that case that the prosecutor &#8216;should imagine himself to be the fact finder and ask himself whether, on balance, the evidence was sufficient to merit a conviction taking into account what he knew about the defence case&#8217;: para 49. That suggests a test of &#8216;is it more likely than not that I would convict, knowing what I do about the case&#8217;?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">However, the reference to a &#8216;reasonable&#8217; jury, judge or magistrate must contemplate that there are at least some cases in which different courts could reasonably take different views of the evidence in the same case. So the reasonable prosecutor should ask himself what a reasonable court might do, not necessarily what he himself would do. Due allowance should also be made for the fact that it is only when the matter actually comes on for trial that it will be possible to decide whom to believe. We all know that the evidence can come out very differently in court from how it comes over on the page: sometimes it is fatally undermined by cross-examination but sometimes it is strengthened.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">But if the test does contemplate that different courts could reach different views, I have grave difficulty in understanding how the CPS could possibly have decided to stop the prosecution in this case on evidential grounds. It is admitted that there were two reasonable views of the evidence in this case, that a reasonable prosecutor could have formed the view that it was indeed more likely than not that a court would convict. That is scarcely surprising. The time when and place where the claimant suffered injuries are not in doubt. The injuries are consistent with an assault having taken place. Nor is the presence of the accused at the scene seriously disputed. As yet they have offered no alternative explanation of events.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">So if there are admittedly two reasonable views of the CPS-defined &#8216;realistic prospect of success&#8217; in this case, I cannot understand how it was not allowed to proceed, unless the CPS test in fact means something rather different. Perhaps, in effect, it means, &#8216;do I, as a reasonable prosecutor, think that it is more likely than not that, when this case gets to court, there will be a conviction?&#8217; But if that is the test, we are back to a simple &#8216;better than evens&#8217; test, which contemplates that juries may indeed be unreasonable and prejudiced, and many cases which are in fact prosecuted now would not be taken forward.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">These nuances may seem overly technical, but they matter hugely to the protection of vulnerable people from all forms of neglect and abuse, whether physical or sexual. The requirement of corroboration was abolished two decades ago. But one has only to listen to the radio or read the newspapers, especially at present, to know that apparently credible complaints have not been taken further because of so-called &#8216;lack of evidence&#8217;. This was presumably not because of a formal requirement of corroboration but because of the difficulty of securing convictions without some independent evidence which confirms the complainant&#8217;s account. Despite this reluctance, we have made great strides in recent years in understanding that vulnerable witnesses are capable of being believed and in helping them to give the best evidence that they can. A commendable willingness to prosecute in the face of considerable odds has been part of this advance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">For my part, therefore, I consider that Mr Fitzgerald&#8217;s alternative case is unanswerable. How can it possibly have been Parliament&#8217;s intention to allow the CPS to take over and prevent a private prosecution where a reasonable prosecutor could take the view that a reasonable court is likely to convict? This is to leave the victim (who, as Lord Mance points out, knows whether or not she is the victim of crime) to the chance of which among many no doubt entirely reasonable prosecutors handles her case. The fact that this is done on paper without any face to face contact with the witnesses only increases the possibility that reasonable prosecutors can take different views.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The possibility of judicial review of the prosecutor&#8217;s decision is not a good enough safeguard, as this case demonstrates only too clearly. Just as a reasonable prosecutor could take the view that the case should proceed, a reasonable prosecutor could take the view that it should not. The possibility of bringing a private prosecution, however remote to most people, is a much more effective safeguard. Now that the new policy has effectively removed it, the victims of crime will have little prospect of challenging the prosecutor&#8217;s decisions. This is likely to increase, rather than decrease, the risk of &#8216;inertia or partiality on the part of authority&#8217; (see <span style="font-style:italic">Gouriet v Union of Post Office Workers</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1978] AC 435" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1978">[1978] AC 435</ref>, 477). That risk is already considerable in the sort of problematic cases about which I am most concerned.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Nor am I the only person to be concerned about such cases. They are likely to involve a violation of the victim&#8217;s rights under article 8 or, in extreme cases, article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Under both articles, the state has a positive obligation to provide an effective deterrent, in the shape of the criminal law: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">X and Y v The Netherlands</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="(1985) 8 EHRR 235" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">(1985) 8 EHRR 235</ref><span style="font-style:italic">.</span> That obligation is not fulfilled if a private prosecution, which a reasonable prosecutor could consider more likely than not to succeed before a reasonable court, can be prevented because another prosecutor takes a different view.</p>
