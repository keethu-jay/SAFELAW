	    <p><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">WORKER STATUS</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt">The claimant worked for the respondent as an investment manager between April 2015 and January 2021. Under the terms of his contract, which were negotiated individually with him in some respects, he could use employees or agents to provide services on his behalf, provided that employee or agent was approved by the respondent at its &#8220;sole discretion&#8221; (clause 2.5). The contract also described the claimant as an &#8220;independent contractor&#8221; and said it was not to be construed as creating an employee/employer relationship (clause 11). </span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt">At a preliminary hearing, an employment judge (&#8220;EJ&#8221;) held that the claimant was not a worker for the purpose of section 230 of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/18" uk:canonical="1996 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Employment Rights Act 1996</ref></span><span style="font-size:12pt"> and regulation 2 of the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">Working Time Regulations 1998</span><span style="font-size:12pt">. First, she held that the respondent&#8217;s discretion in clause 2.5 of the contract was subject to an implied term that such consent would not be unreasonably withheld. Although clause 2.5 had never been exercised in practice, it was a genuine clause and, in light of the implied term to which it was subject, meant that the claimant owed no obligation to perform any work or services personally. Second, she held that the respondent was a client or customer of the claimant&#8217;s business undertaking, having regard (among other matters) to the label in clause 11 of the contract and to the fact the claimant did his own personal business in normal office hours. The claimant appealed on both grounds.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt">The claimant&#8217;s appeal was allowed in part. First, the EJ had erred in implying a term into the contract on the basis that such a term was necessary to give clause 2.5 efficacy and not leave it as a thing &#8220;writ in water&#8221;. The clause was perfectly workable without such an implied term, the effect of the implied term in excluding statutory rights ran contrary to the purpose of implying a term to protect against a potential abuse of power in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">Braganza v BP Shipping </span><span style="font-size:12pt"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] ICR 449" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] ICR 449</ref>, and it was not necessary to imply such a term to give clause 2.5 business efficacy or on the basis it went without saying. Second, in deciding whether clause 2.5 was genuine, the EJ did not have regard to the highly relevant consideration that it had never been exercised in practice, a factor of especial importance after </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">Uber BV v Aslam </span><span style="font-size:12pt"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2021] ICR 657" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] ICR 657</ref>. Third, the EJ should not have given any weight to the fact that clause 11.1 said that the claimant was an independent contractor and was not an employee when it came to addressing worker status. Fourth, that the claimant did some personal trading in working hours, just like directly-employed investment managers, did not indicate that he was conducting a business undertaking for clients or customers other than the respondent (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-size:12pt">Wolstenholme v Post Office </span><span style="font-size:12pt"><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] ICR 546" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] ICR 546</ref> considered).</span></p>

The  Respondent&#8217;s  position  is  that  the  Claimant  was  using  Mr  Amiee  as  a  substitute and that he worked on the Claimant&#8217;s clients, but was never paid  for that work by the Respondent. Indeed, from October 2020 the Respondent  had required each broker to nominate an alternate broker as a formal cover  during periods of absence and Stephen Simper suggested that the Claimant  nominate  Mr  Amiee,  and  vice  versa.  The  Claimant&#8217;s  position  is  that  this  arrangement  was  just  what  it  would  have  been  if  the  two  of  them  were  employees of the Respondent: they provided cover for each other.   </span></p>

I accept the Claimant&#8217;s evidence in this respect, but it  is  nonetheless  the  case  that  in  those  trades  Mr  Amiee  was  formally  the  nominated deal broker on the transaction, but as the transaction was for the  Claimant&#8217;s  clients  he  would  not  have  been  paid.  Moreover,  the  Claimant  accepted that in theory Mr Amiee could have placed on the market trades for  his clients, and vice versa, but he was unable to think of an example where  that had happened in six years.  </span></p>

Some of them are decisions of the EAT, which are not. In the light of the cases and the language and objects of the relevant legislation, I would summarise as follows the applicable principles as to the requirement for personal performance. Firstly, an unfettered right to substitute another person to do the work or perform the services is inconsistent with an undertaking to do so personally. Secondly, a conditional right to substitute another person may or may not be inconsistent with personal performance depending upon the conditionality. It will depend on the precise contractual arrangements and, in particular, the nature and degree of any fetter on a right of substitution or, using different language, the extent to which the right of substitution is limited or occasional. Thirdly, by way of example, a right of substitution only when the contractor is unable to carry out the work will, subject to any exceptional facts, be consistent with personal performance. Fourthly, again by way of example, a right of substitution limited only by the need to show that the substitute is as qualified as the contractor to do the work, whether or not that entails a particular procedure, will, subject to any exceptional facts, be inconsistent with personal performance. Fifthly, again by way of example, a right to substitute only with the consent of another person who has an absolute and unqualified discretion to withhold consent will be consistent with personal performance&#8221;</p>

In considering that paragraph, however, it is important to bear in mind the following. First, the actual issue for a tribunal is whether a claimant is under an obligation personally to perform the work or provide the services. Secondly, Sir Terence Etherton MR was seeking to summarise the principles to be drawn from existing case law: he was not seeking to establish a rigid classification or lay down strict rules as to what did or did not amount to personal performance or when a right of substitution did or did not negate the existence of an obligation to do work personally. Thirdly, on analysis of paragraph 84, there are only two principles summarised. The first is that if the claimant has what is described as an unfettered right to substitute another person to do the work or perform the services that is inconsistent with an undertaking to do so personally. The second principle is that a conditional right "may or may not be inconsistent" with personal performance depending on the precise contractual arrangements and, in particular "the nature and degree of any fetter on a right of substitution". The third to fifth points made in paragraph 84 are provided, expressly, "by way example", of situations where a contractual right on the part of the claimant may be one indicator that the obligation is or is not one to do the work or perform the services personally. The points made are, in effect, a summary of the earlier decisions (which each involved particular facts) which had been analysed by Sir Terence Etherton MR at paragraphs 76 to 83 of his judgment.</p>

It is not for the courts to re-write the parties' bargain for them, still less to substitute themselves for the contractually agreed decision-maker. Nevertheless, the party who is charged with making decisions which affect the rights of both parties to the contract has a clear conflict of interest. That conflict is heightened where there is a significant imbalance of power between the contracting parties as there often will be in an employment contract. The courts have therefore sought to ensure that such contractual powers are not abused. They have done so by implying a term as to the manner in which such powers may be exercised, a term which may vary according to the terms of the contract and the context in which the decision-making power is given.&#8221;</p>

The implied term derived from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Paragon Finance</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> is a very limited restriction on the scope of the relevant discretion. Indeed, at para. 41 of his judgment in that case, Dyson LJ thought that a lender who acted in a way no reasonable lender could act would probably also act for an improper purpose, capriciously or arbitrarily. Translated into the present claim, the question to be addressed would be whether the limited restriction on the Respondent&#8217;s power to refuse consent to a substitute meant, in effect, that the Claimant owed no obligation of personal service. Here it appears the EJ treated the matter as resolved by </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">UK Mail Ltd. v Creasey</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, cited by her at para. 50,</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'"/><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">once the implied term was inserted in the contract.

It is convenient to address at this stage the first of the two arguments raised in the Respondent&#8217;s answer for upholding the EJ&#8217;s reasons. Mr Halliday submits that (i) the evidence and findings of the ET showed that Mr Amiee could cover for the Claimant and (ii) because the Claimant never owed an obligation to work, Mr Amiee could always &#8220;cover&#8221; for the Claimant, meaning the Claimant never owed any obligation to do any work. In my judgement, this argument allows contractual form to triumph over the facts &#8220;viewed realistically&#8221; and departs from the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Uber</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> approach to the statutory question. </span></p>

I did not understand Mr Halliday to dispute this and, as the EJ recorded, it was not in dispute before her that there was sufficient &#8220;mutuality of obligation&#8221; (see paras 41, 49). Moreover, even if the EJ found that the Claimant was free to work when he wanted (para. 22), she found that in fact during his engagement he worked solely for the Respondent, noting his evidence that it was not practicable for him to work for anyone else because of the degree to which he was integrated into the Respondent (para. 19). While the EJ did not actually find how many hours the Claimant worked each week, the obvious implication of these paragraphs is that in fact the Claimant provided extensive and exclusive personal service for the Respondent during the time of his engagement. Reinforcing this is para. 61, where the EJ considered that the &#8220;facts alone&#8221;, viewed without clause 2.5 in the picture, pointed towards personal service. </span></p>

Its real premise is that the Claimant owed no obligation to do anything under his contract because he could take every day as a holiday. For him, every day was St Monday&#8217;s day. This reflects an argument Mr Halliday raised in the ET, based on </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">James v Redcats</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, to which the EJ referred at paras 48-49 of her reasons. However, just like a zero-hours contract worker, or the valeteers in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Autoclenz</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, the Claimant may not have been obliged to work on any particular occasion or at all under the terms of his written contract. But this was not a reason the EJ relied on for finding he owed no obligation to work personally. On the contrary, she was inclined to the view that, in the absence of  clause 2.5 in his Contract and the implied term to which it was subject, the  &#8220;facts alone&#8221; indicated he </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">did</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> owe an obligation of personal service (para. 60). There was material to support that finding, including the fact that the Claimant  worked solely for the Respondent and notified his personal assistant when he was away. It was a finding which reflects the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Uber</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> approach and I do not consider it is open to me, on appeal, to take a different view.</span></p>

I am inclined to consider that a determination by the Revenue that someone is self-employed is likely to be of little assistance in that exercise, though it is not an issue that arises here. By the same token, I consider that the characterisation of the relationship in clause 11 as not being one of employer and employee, and the accompanying obligation on the part of the Claimant to pay his own taxes, were not matters which should have been given any weight.

In the Respondent&#8217;s answer, an alternative basis is given for upholding the ET&#8217;s decision is that personal service was not the &#8220;dominant feature&#8221; or &#8220;dominant purpose&#8221; of the Contract. Rather, it is submitted, its dominant feature was to generate fees and commissions from clients, and to share those fees between the Claimant and Respondent.

Those cases emphasise that &#8220;dominant purpose&#8221; or &#8220;dominant feature&#8221; is not the legal test but just one potential source of guidance, and that tribunals must apply all elements of the statutory test, including the &#8220;client or customer&#8221; part. Even assuming that the dominant feature of this Contract was not the provision of personal service, I do not consider it could be said that the </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">only</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> conclusion open to the ET here was that the Respondent was a client or customer of the Claimant&#8217;s business undertaking.</span></p>

Here, as set out above, the facts of the Claimant&#8217;s integration, and the absence of marketing to the world in general, far from suggesting he was not a worker tended to suggest he was. Although I do not consider it was perverse of the EJ to decide he was not a worker in light of those matters, they undermine any contention that the only permissible conclusion from the EJ&#8217;s findings was that the Claimant was not a worker.</span></p>

First, as to proportionality, there is likely to be some saving in the parties&#8217; time and costs if the matter is remitted to EJ Stout, though I accept that this is only likely to be a small saving in a preliminary hearing which only took two days to be heard. Second, the hearing took place a little more than a year ago and much of the evidence is documentary. In those circumstances, loss of recollection is not a factor counting against remission to EJ Stout. Third, there is no suggestion of any bias or partiality. Fourth, the EJ&#8217;s decision was not wholly flawed: I have allowed the appeal only on the grounds specified above, in an area which continues to trouble employment tribunals (and EAT and appellate judges). Fifth, I have confidence the EJ can fairly re-examine the issues relevant to worker status in light of this judgment. I note the Claimant&#8217;s concern that the EJ was a member of the same chambers as the Respondent&#8217;s counsel. But this is not ordinarily a factor giving rise to a real danger of bias (and it was not raised as a ground of appeal before me) - see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Locabail (UK) Ltd v Bayfield Properties Ltd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] QB 451" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] QB 451</ref> at para. 25 &#8211; and I consider there is nothing to displace the assumption that the EJ will deal with the matter professionally and fairly on remission. </span></p>
