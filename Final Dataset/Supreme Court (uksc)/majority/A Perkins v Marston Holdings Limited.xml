	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.02in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The Claimant claims that the Respondent breached the equality clause in her contract as she was paid less than three male comparators who did work of equal value.  This appeal concerns the correct approach to the material factor defence in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/69" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15 s. 69" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.69</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref>.  The Claimant challenged the ET&#8217;s factual findings that there were three material factors which accounted for the pay difference between her and her comparators.  The EAT held that there was no higher threshold of cogency or particularisation required to prove a material factor and the ET&#8217;s findings were not perverse. </span></p>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.02in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The Claimant argued that two of the material factors were tainted by sex and required to be justified as a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. She challenged the ET&#8217;s conclusion that the Respondent did not need to justify those material factors because she did not share the particular disadvantage that applied to other women.  The EAT found that the ET had erred in its approach to particular disadvantage by impermissibly enquiring into the reason why there was a particular disadvantage.  The EAT held that there was no need for the Claimant to prove the reason why a material factor works to the disadvantage of women or to her as it is enough that it does work to their disadvantage.  The matter was remitted to the ET.</span></p>
	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.02in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The Respondent&#8217;s cross appeal challenged the findings (in the alternative) that the material factors were not a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aims of the Respondent because there were less discriminatory ways of achieving those aims. The EAT allowed the cross appeal as a critical and thorough evaluation is required and yet the ET did not analyse what part of the pay gap was proportionate, did not take account of the impact on staff retention and the loss of certification and did not assess proportionate or disproportionate impact using the pool of employees to whom the material factors applied.</span></p>

The Respondent is a market leading enforcement business with contracts for the enforcement of debts, judgments, tax liabilities, penalties and eviction orders.  The Respondent&#8217;s national clients included HMCTS, HMRC and Highways England.  The Claimant&#8217;s three male comparators were Divisional Enforcement Directors within that part of the Respondent&#8217;s business.  They managed enforcement agents collecting debts for these national clients.  These roles had previously been called Regional Enforcement Managers and were referred to as DEDs or REMs.</span></p>

That was the part of the business in which the Claimant was employed. By 2016 she was an Operations Performance and Analytical Manager responsible for managing some of the Respondent&#8217;s enforcement agents who collected debts for local authorities. By the time of her redundancy in May 2022 her role was called Head of Enforcement &#8211; Local Taxation (&#8220;HoELT&#8221;).  She claimed her roles were of equal value to the DEDs/REMs. </span></p>

The REMs/DEDs were responsible for delivering national contracts in accordance with challenging Key Performance Indicators (&#8220;KPIs&#8221;) agreed with each national client. Enforcement agents would visit debtors&#8217; homes and persuade them to discharge their debts and would occasionally execute eviction warrants with the aid of a locksmith. EAs were paid on commission when a debtor had paid either in part or in full. Most of them earned between &#163;35,000 and &#163;75,000 but a handful of the best could earn six figure sums. About 90% of EAs were men, but some of the most effective were women. There was a high turnover of EAs as they could swap to work for a rival enforcement business so one of the key roles of REMs/DEDs was to encourage retention of high-performing agents.  By 2021 the DEDs were paid &#163;91,800 and were Grade 3 in the Respondent&#8217;s loose grading structure.</span></p>

The REMs/DEDs reported to Mr Burton, the National Enforcement Director as did the Claimant from June 2021.  Before that she had reported to Mrs Alessi the National Enforcement Director for the local authority part of the business.  </span></p>

They were not paid by commission but through various flat fees. They could seize a debtor&#8217;s goods after obtaining a magistrates&#8217; court liability order which resulted in debtors paying in instalments. These agents were referred to by the ET as &#8220;enforcement officers&#8221; or &#8220;EOs&#8221; to differentiate them from the commission-based enforcement agents or EAs on national contracts. The Respondent had to perform to KPIs contained in the local authority contracts, but they were not as demanding as those under the national contracts. Staff retention rates in the Claimant&#8217;s team were high with a relatively stable workforce.  </span></p>

By 2021 she was a Grade 3 role and was paid &#163;51,500 which was comparable to the Respondent&#8217;s Head of Decision Support, who was a man. She was always office based. The Respondent also employed a Head of Client (Ms Ashworth) and a Head of Data Analytics.  The Respondent benchmarked the Claimant&#8217;s pay against such roles and not against the REMs/DEDs.</span></p>

The Respondent&#8217;s pay-setting rationale was opaque and generally undocumented. Until 2019 the REMs/DEDs&#8217; pay varied considerably and was increased on an ad hoc basis. Until her redundancy in 2017 the highest paid REM was a woman based outside of London.  However in 2019 Mr Burton increased all their salaries to &#163;90,000 in response to a credible suggestion that competitors were offering better pay for two of REMs/DEDs to move to them.  The increase was to dissuade the Respondent&#8217;s REMs/DEDs from resigning to move to a competitor, return to being an enforcement agent or set up an enforcement business of their own.</span></p>

She said this was obvious from the statistics as the REMs/DEDs were predominantly men and the only HoELT - the Claimant - was a woman. Alternatively, she contended that market forces disadvantaged women. She said as the Respondent recruited REMs/DEDs from a pool of successful EAs that disadvantaged women, because the vast majority of EAs were men.

But the KPIs for the REMs/DEDs were more pressing. A target of achieving a defined number of PIFs within 90 days or 12 months is different in nature to a target of maintaining an average payover, with collection periods of up to 3 years being tolerated.</span></p>

If there was a group of female would-be REMs and DEDs who missed out on eligibility because they had been put off being an enforcement agent, the claimant was not one of them. Her route to being a senior operational enforcement manager was not shaped by any real or perceived barrier to working as an EA.

We would, at least, need to assess the degree to which reliance on these market forces adversely affected women doing work equal to the claimant&#8217;s work. One of the difficulties in this case is that we know very little about how many women were adversely affected in this way.

All Mr Burton needed to do was to recruit REMs and DEDs from a wider pool. The facts did not demonstrate to us, objectively, that it was reasonably necessary for an REM or DED to have been an EA at all. From our outsider&#8217;s perspective, what we think Mr Burton needed was somebody, from whatever background, who could learn and understand the legal and commercial environment in which EAs worked, command the confidence of EAs, sell the organisation to new recruits, build a rapport with them, line-manage the AEMs, supervise EAs occasionally on house visits, and provide operational information to the Client Account Managers as and when necessary.

These grounds were directed to a full hearing by order of Deputy High Court Judge Bowers KC dated 8 August 2024. The first ground was that the ET erred in its approach to whether the material factors were indirectly discriminatory as the Claimant shared the disadvantage of not having experience as an enforcement agent (the pool from which the higher paid REMs/DEDs was recruited).  Grounds 2 to 4 were attacks on the finding of facts in relation to the three material factors.  Ms Darlow Stearn, appearing for the Claimant, made clear that Ground 5 was not a self-standing ground, but merely supported Grounds 2 to 4 and she made no separate submissions upon it. </span></p>

The variation between her contract and the man's contract is presumed to be due to the difference of sex. The burden passes to the employer to show that the explanation for the variation is not tainted with sex. In order to discharge this burden the employer must satisfy the tribunal on several matters. First, that the proffered explanation, or reason, is genuine, and not a sham or pretence. Second, that the less favourable treatment is due to this reason. The factor relied upon must be the cause of the disparity. In this regard, and in this sense, the factor must be a &#8220;material&#8221; factor, that is, a significant and relevant factor. Third, that the reason is not &#8220;the difference of sex.&#8221; This phrase is apt to embrace any form of sex discrimination, whether direct or indirect. Fourth, that the factor relied upon is or, in a case within section 1(2)(c) , may be a &#8220;material&#8221; difference, that is, a significant and relevant difference, between the woman's case and the man's case.&#8221;</span></p>

The essential comparison is between the positions of the men within the relevant pool, viewed as a group, and the women in the pool, likewise viewed as a group. The requirement that the claimant herself should suffer the same disadvantage is additional, and merely ensures that she should not be entitled to complain of a disadvantage to which she is not herself subject.

Unless the Claimant could prove that actual &#8220;persons of the same sex doing [equal work]&#8221; were put at a particular disadvantage she could not shift the burden to the employer.

The Respondent&#8217;s conclusion was that the wording of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/69/2" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15 s. 69" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s.69(2)</ref> was written in restricted terms and was not the wide and flexible test suggested by the Claimant. </span></p>

The Claimant criticises the finding of fact on the basis that the ET found at paragraph 70 that the comparators did not do much travel and found that forced entry (paragraph 30) and client contact (paragraph 80) was rare and there was no difference between the roles in terms of managing and coaching (paragraph 123).  However those parts of the evidence were directed to different material factors which the ET rejected and were not matters which were relevant to the KPI pressure which founded the Competition and Expectation material factor.</span></p>

The ET accepted Mr Burton&#8217;s evidence that Mr Avery approached Mr Burton in 2019 to say that a competitor had offered him and Mr Hayes about &#163;50,000 more money and his current earnings were no more than he could earn as an EA. The ET accepted Mr Burton&#8217;s evidence that he agreed to increase the pay of the DEDs to &#163;90,000 for that reason.  The Claimant says that this is not corroborated in Mr Avery&#8217;s witness statement, but he was not called and the ET placed less weight on his evidence.  The ET did note that there was no staff change form and that any document would only have said &#8220;exceptional pay increase&#8221;.  The ET heard live evidence about market forces and reached a finding that cannot be said to be perverse.  The ET decided that the evidence was sufficiently cogent to persuade it.</span></p>

Ms Seymour&#8217;s initial point was that a cross appeal may have been unnecessary as if the question of indirect discrimination was remitted to be considered afresh, then it only was sensible to remit the question of justification to the same ET.  The ET could then apply the justification test in the context of whatever indirect discrimination was found to taint the material factors.

This suggests that the ET considered that some pay gap was proportionate, but it cannot be ascertained from the ET reasons what part.  I agree that the ET needed at least to touch upon whether the removal of the requirement for REMs/DEDs to have been EAs would in fact have resulted in a wider group of applicants for the roles.  It should have considered the impact that would have on reducing REMs/DEDs salaries when the ET had already found as a fact in paragraph 156 that reducing their pay risked losing them to competitors. That risk is not analysed nor the impact on the loss of EA certificates as the ET found that was still a need for some travel and some visits (paragraph 71).</span></p>

There is some force in this criticism due to the typographical error where the ET uses the term &#8220;market forces&#8221;.  I accept it could be read as justifying only one of the two material factors by using that expression. However I think it must have meant &#8220;material factors&#8221; rather than &#8220;market forces&#8221;.  In any event, read as a whole, it is clear enough that the ET identified the two factors to be justified as market forces and recruitment/retention of EAs.  The ET identified the disadvantage which arose from those factors.  Between them they provided most of the cause of the disparity in pay between the Claimant (&#163;51,500 in December 2021) and the male comparators (&#163;91,800 in December 2021).  The ET&#8217;s reasons therefore indicate the factors to be justified and set out the very substantial &#163;40,000 difference in their pay which those factors had largely caused. </span></p>

I accept that if the key aspect of a case or a vital part of a tribunal&#8217;s consideration is not explored with the parties during a hearing, then it may be unjust for a tribunal to rely upon that in its judgment. The ET heard Mr Burton&#8217;s evidence and as an industrial jury decided that there was a less discriminatory way to achieve the legitimate aims of the Respondent. The ET rejected his evidence at paragraph 159.  It held that somebody, from whatever background could learn and understand the legal and commercial environment in which EAs worked, command their confidence, sell the organisation to new recruits, build a rapport, line-manage and supervise them occasionally on house visits.
