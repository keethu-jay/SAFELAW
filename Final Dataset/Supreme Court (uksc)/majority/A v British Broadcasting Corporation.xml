In its order, the court permitted the applicant for judicial review to amend his application by deleting his name and address and substituting letters of the alphabet, in the exercise (or, as the BBC argues, purported exercise) of a common law power. The court also gave directions under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Contempt of Court Act 1981</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1981 Act</ref>&#8221;) prohibiting the publication of his name or other identifying details and directing that no picture of him should be published or broadcast. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The first respondent to this appeal, whom I shall refer to as A, is a foreign national who arrived in the UK as a visitor in 1991. Later that year he married a UK citizen, who also came from his country of origin and had a child from a previous relationship. He was then granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. In 1996 he was convicted of sexual offences against his step-child and was sentenced to 4 years&#8217; imprisonment. In 1998 the second respondent, the Home Secretary, decided that he should be deported, and a notice of intention to make a deportation order was served. A and his wife were by then divorced. In 2000 he re-married. He and his second wife have a number of children.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Following service of the deportation notice, protracted proceedings began. The salient aspects can be summarised as follows. In 2001 A&#8217;s appeal against the Home Secretary&#8217;s decision was dismissed. He then applied to the Home Secretary to be allowed to remain in the UK on the ground that his removal would violate his rights under articles 2, 3 and 8 of the ECHR. That application was refused, and a deportation order was served in June 2002. A then appealed against the refusal of his application to remain in the UK. Appeals to an immigration adjudicator and to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal were dismissed in 2003 and 2004 respectively. A further appeal to the Court of Session was however allowed, and it was agreed that the appeal should remitted to the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal for re-hearing. Following that re-hearing, the appeal was dismissed by the tribunal in 2007. A&#8217;s identity was withheld in the proceedings from 2001 onwards.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In its 2007 decision, the tribunal noted that A&#8217;s claim under articles 2 and 3 of the ECHR was based on the argument that, in the event of his return to his country of origin, he would be at risk of death or ill-treatment at the hands of persons enraged by his offences. The tribunal accepted that, if he faced such a risk as a known sexual offender, he was unlikely to receive effective protection from the police. The claim that such a risk existed was however largely based upon the premise that his return to his native country would receive publicity. The tribunal was not satisfied that it would. Although threats of violence had been made against him in his country of origin at the time of the criminal proceedings, when his identity had been disclosed in the media, they had not continued in more recent times. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The claim based on article 8 was also rejected. For present purposes, it is relevant to note that the facts relied upon included an incident in January 2006 when A and his wife were attacked in their home in Scotland by a group of youths. Their children were then taken into care for a time because of police concerns that the house might be fire-bombed. A and his wife were attacked again in June 2006 in a public park in the same town. After that incident A ceased to live with his wife and children. The incidents followed press publicity about A&#8217;s case, in which his name and the town in which he lived were mentioned.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">An appeal against the 2007 decision was allowed by the Court of Session in relation to article 8 only, and the appeal was again remitted to the tribunal for re-hearing on that issue: <span style="font-style:italic">A v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2008] CSIH 59. Following that re-hearing, the appeal on the article 8 ground was dismissed by the tribunal in 2009. Leave to appeal against that decision was refused: <span style="font-style:italic">CB v Secretary of State for the Home Department </span>[2010] CSIH 89; 2011 SC 248. Later in 2010 A claimed asylum and submitted further representations. The claim and representations were treated by the Home Secretary as an application for the revocation of the deportation order made in 2002. That application was refused in 2011. A then appealed to the First-tier Tribunal. It was agreed that the scope of the appeal was confined to articles 3 and 8 of the ECHR.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In dealing with the appeal, the First-tier Tribunal gave a direction to the parties under rule 45(4)(i) of the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (Procedure) Rules 2005 (SI 2005/230) that no report of the proceedings should directly or indirectly identify the appellant or any member of his family. Although the words &#8220;no report&#8221; might, read in isolation, suggest that the direction operated against the media<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>it went on to state that it applied &#8220;to the appellant and to the respondent&#8221;, consistently with rule 45. The direction was given on the basis that, first, the appeal concerned personal information about the lives of children, whose welfare might be injured if such information were revealed and their names known; secondly, the appeal concerned highly personal evidence which should remain confidential; and thirdly, A or others could be put at risk of harm by publication of his name and details. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">A&#8217;s claim under article 3 was again based on evidence, including a report by an expert witness, to the effect that he would be at risk of violence if he returned to his country of origin. It was said that the risk would arise as a result of publicity. The claim under article 8 was based on his family life with his wife and children, with whom he had resumed regular contact, although he continued to live apart from them because of the risk of stigmatisation if they were known to be connected to him. </p>

One of the arguments which he considered was that the First-tier Tribunal had failed to give adequate reasons for rejecting the article 3 claim, and had not properly considered the report of the expert witness. In response, it was argued that the author of the report had failed to recognise that, if the appellant were returned to his home country, that was likely to be following proceedings in which his identity was not disclosed. Lord Boyd concluded that the tribunal had been entitled to find that the risk of A&#8217;s being identified was reduced by anonymisation, and that the point did not satisfy the <span style="font-style:italic">Cart </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Eba </span>test. </p>

Viscount Haldane LC gave the example at p 437 of a court exercising a wardship jurisdiction: such a court was sitting primarily to guard the interests of the ward, and the attainment of that object might require that the public should be excluded. Lunacy proceedings were in a similar position. Another example given by the Lord Chancellor, of greater relevance to the present case, was litigation concerning a secret process, &#8220;where the effect of publicity would be to destroy the subject-matter&#8221;. The Earl of Halsbury considered wardship and lunacy to fall outside the scope of the general principle that justice should be administered in public, but accepted that proceedings concerning trade secrets, or to prevent the publication of private correspondence, were exceptions to that principle, observing at p 443 that &#8220;it would be the height of absurdity as well as of injustice to allow a trial at law to protect either to be made the instrument of destroying the very thing it was intended to protect&#8221;. Similar observations were made by Lord Atkinson at p 450 and by Lord Shaw of Dunfermline at pp 482-483. All of their Lordships stressed the need for a compelling justification for any departure from the principle of open justice. The Lord Chancellor said at pp 437-438:</p>

The question is by no means one which, consistently with the spirit of our jurisprudence, can be dealt with by the judge as resting in his mere discretion as to what is expedient. The latter must treat it as one of principle, and as turning, not on convenience, but on necessity."</p>

Lord Neuberger, giving the judgment of the majority, described the principle as fundamental to the dispensation of justice in a modern, democratic society (para 2). He added that it had long been accepted that, in rare cases, a court had an inherent power to receive evidence and argument in a hearing from which the public and the press were excluded, but said that such a course might only be taken (i) if it was strictly necessary to have a private hearing in order to achieve justice between the parties, and (ii) if the degree of privacy was kept to an absolute minimum. He gave, as examples of such cases, litigation where children were involved, where threatened breaches of privacy were being alleged, and where commercially valuable secret information was in issue.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It has also been recognised in the English case law, consistently with Lord Neuberger&#8217;s requirement of the degree of privacy being kept to a minimum, that where the interests of justice require some qualification of the principle of open justice, it may not be necessary to exclude the public or the press from the hearing: it may suffice that particular information is withheld. In <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney General v Leveller Magazine Ltd, </span>for example,<span style="font-style:italic"/>Lord Diplock accepted at p 451 that, where the court might sit <span style="font-style:italic">in camera</span> in order to preserve the anonymity of a witness in the interests of national security, it could instead allow &#8220;a much less drastic derogation from the principle of open justice&#8221;, namely that the witness should give evidence in public but should be permitted to withhold his name from the public and the press. Viscount Dilhorne and Lord Edmund-Davies agreed that the court could do so, in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction to control its own procedure: pp 458 and 464 respectively. Viscount Dilhorne gave as an example the practice of allowing a witness complaining of blackmail to withhold his identity from public disclosure in court, judicially approved in <a href="http://login.westlaw.co.uk/maf/wluk/app/document?src=doc&amp;linktype=ref&amp;context=102&amp;crumb-action=replace&amp;docguid=I6A5BB230E42811DA8FC2A0F0355337E9"><span class="Emphasis">R v Socialist Worker Printers and Publishers Ltd, Ex p Attorney General <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1975] QB 637" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1975">[1975] QB 637</ref></span></a>. The proposition that the court had no power to allow a witness&#8217;s name to be withheld from the public had been roundly rejected in that case: such a direction, it was held, was clearly preferable to an order for trial <span style="font-style:italic">in camera</span> where "the entire supervision by the public is gone" (p 652).</p>

Exceptions have to be made in special circumstances to allow the court to conduct its proceedings behind closed doors where the interests of justice require this to be done. But that is always the exception, and the general principle which applies equally in the sheriff court as it does in the Court of Session is that the court sits both for the hearing of cases and for the advising of them with open doors.&#8221; </p>

The point is illustrated by the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Scottish Lion Insurance Co Ltd v Goodrich Corporation </span>[2011] CSIH 18; 2011 SC 534, in which the court permitted the identities of the applicants to be withheld from public disclosure. The object of the proceedings was to protect the confidentiality of documents disclosing their identities, and an order designed to achieve that objective had previously been made by the court. As the court noted, the disclosure of their identities would be inconsistent with that order and would undermine the confidentiality which the proceedings were intended to preserve. The case was therefore one in which a limitation of the principle of open justice was necessary both to protect confidential information and to prevent the frustration of the judicial process. </p>

It therefore had the inherent power, in his opinion, to withhold the identity of a party where, regardless of the outcome of the case, the disclosure of that party&#8217;s identity would constitute an injustice to him. The Lord President gave as examples cases where disclosure would endanger a party&#8217;s safety or would be commercially ruinous. He added that, quite apart from the Convention-related aspects of the problem, he would regard it as the court&#8217;s duty to withhold the identity of a female pursuer where the decision turned on intimate medical evidence. He also considered that the court&#8217;s inherent jurisdiction could be extended to the protection of third parties whose rights and interests might be affected in similar ways. The other members of the First Division expressed their agreement. </p>

The examples which the Lord President gave were at a correspondingly high level of generality. Counsel argued however that this passage was an incorrect statement of the law, and might be treated by lower courts as authoritative. That apprehension appears to have been one of the principal factors to have prompted the bringing of this appeal, as much of the argument presented on behalf of the BBC was devoted to criticism of this <span style="font-style:italic">obiter dictum</span>. In the circumstances, some general observations may be made.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">As I have explained, it has long been recognised that the courts have the power to permit the identity of a party or a witness to be withheld from public disclosure where that is necessary in the interests of justice. The Lord President was plainly right to approach the matter on the basis that the interests of justice are not confined to the court&#8217;s reaching a just decision on the issue in dispute between the parties. It is necessary in the first place to recognise that the administration of justice is a continuing process: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Attorney-General v Butterworth </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1963] 1 QB 696" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1963">[1963] 1 QB 696</ref>, 725 per Donovan LJ. The court can therefore take steps in current proceedings in order to ensure that the interests of justice will not be defeated in the future. For example, the High Court of Justiciary has permitted undercover police officers to give evidence while screened from the sight of the general public, and without public disclosure of their identities, in order to avoid jeopardising their effectiveness in future investigations. </p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Other cases may raise different considerations. In some cases, for example, anonymity may be necessary in view of risks to the safety of a party or a witness. The point can be illustrated by the case of <span style="font-style:italic">A v Scottish Minsters </span>2008 SLT 412, where a prisoner serving a sentence for sexual offences was permitted to bring proceedings, challenging the notification requirements applicable to sexual offenders, without disclosing his identity publicly, because of the danger to his safety if the nature of his offending became known to his fellow prisoners. The same approach was followed when the case subsequently came before the Inner House. In other cases the health of a vulnerable person may be at risk. An example is the case of <span style="font-style:italic">HM Advocate v M </span>[2007] HCJ 2, 2007 SLT 462, where the court made a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> order to prevent the publication of the identity of a woman who was due to be the principal witness at the trial of a person charged with having recklessly infected her with HIV. There was evidence before the court that the woman&#8217;s mental health would be endangered if her identity became publicly known. There was also a risk that the woman would otherwise be unable to give evidence, in which event the prosecution could not proceed. An example of a case where harm of a different kind was considered to justify a departure from the ordinary practice is <span style="font-style:italic">Devine v Secretary of State for Scotland </span>(22 January 1993, unreported)<span style="font-style:italic">, </span>an action of damages arising from the deployment of the SAS to end a prison siege, where Lord Coulsfield permitted the soldiers to give evidence while screened from the view of the general public, and without disclosing their names publicly. He did so on the basis that their evidence was essential to the proper presentation of the defence, and the Army&#8217;s ability to deploy them in future operations would otherwise be compromised. In such a case, their appearance and identities were of such peripheral, if any, relevance to the judicial process that it would have been disproportionate to require their disclosure. These are only a few examples.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Some of these examples may arguably go beyond the categories envisaged in some of the older authorities. As Lord Loreburn observed however in <span style="font-style:italic">Scott v Scott </span>at p 446, it would be impossible to enumerate or anticipate all possible contingencies. Furthermore, in this area as in others the common law is capable of development. The application of the principle of open justice may change in response to changes in society and in the administration of justice. It can also develop having regard to the approach adopted in other common law countries, some of which have constitutional texts containing guarantees comparable to the Convention rights, while in others the approach adopted reflects the courts&#8217; view of the requirements of justice. To give only one example, the Supreme Court of Canada has considered some of the issues which I have mentioned, such as the anonymity of complainants in cases of sexual assault (<span style="font-style:italic">Canadian Newspapers Co v Canada </span>[1988] 1 SCR 122), the protection of parties to proceedings from embarrassment or humiliation (<span style="font-style:italic">Edmonton Journal v Alberta </span>[1989] 2 SCR 1326) and the concealment of the identity of undercover police officers (<span style="font-style:italic">R v Mentuck </span>[2001] 3 SCR 442). The development of the common law can also of course be influenced by the ECHR. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The examples given by the Lord President of a party or witness whose safety may be endangered or who may suffer commercial ruin if his identity becomes known, or that of the female pursuer where the decision turns on intimate medical evidence, are all capable of raising issues which could warrant a qualification of the principle of open justice, applying the approach which I have explained. In relation to the last example, which was the subject of particular criticism by counsel for the BBC, I agree with the Lord President that it would be in the interests of justice to protect a party to proceedings from the painful and humiliating disclosure of personal information about her where there was no public interest in its being publicised. Whether a departure from the principle of open justice was justified in any particular case would depend on the facts of that case. As Lord Toulson observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Kennedy v The Charity Commission </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2014/20" uk:canonical="[2014] UKSC 20" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2014">[2014] UKSC 20</ref>, para 113, the court has to carry out a balancing exercise which will be fact-specific. Central to the court&#8217;s evaluation will be the purpose of the open justice principle, the potential value of the information in question in advancing that purpose and, conversely, any risk of harm which its disclosure may cause to the maintenance of an effective judicial process or to the legitimate interests of others.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Lord President observed at para 39 that, even if the media were not entitled to be heard by virtue of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/12/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 12(2)</ref> of the Human Rights Act, they were entitled to be heard as a matter of fairness, although there was a question as to the stage at which the opportunity to be heard should be given. I agree. There are many situations in which courts make orders without having heard the persons who may be affected by them, usually because it is impractical, for one reason or another, to afford a hearing to those persons in advance of the making of the order. In such circumstances, fairness is secured by enabling any person affected to seek the recall of the order promptly at a hearing <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes. </span>In principle, an order under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1981 Act</ref> falls within the ambit of that approach. It would be impractical to afford a hearing to all those who might be affected by a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> order (including bloggers, social media users and internet-based organisations) before such an order was made; but fairness requires that they should be able to seek the recall of the order promptly at a hearing <span style="font-style:italic">inter partes</span>. Article 13 of the Convention also requires that the media should have an effective remedy for any violation of their article 10 rights. That requirement is capable of being fulfilled, where a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> order has been made <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte</span>, provided its recall can be sought promptly at a hearing at which the media are able to make representations (cf<span style="font-style:italic"> Mackay and BBC Scotland v United Kingdom </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2010) 53 EHRR 671" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">(2010) 53 EHRR 671</ref>, para 32). As the facts of this case demonstrate, the existing procedures in the Court of Session are capable of satisfying those requirements.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">68.<marker name="tab"/>That said, a conclusion that the existing procedures provide a sufficient safeguard to meet the requirements of the Convention does not mean to say that improved procedures may not be possible and desirable. Although it would be impractical to provide all those who might be affected by a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> order with an opportunity to make representations before such an order is made, it may nevertheless be possible in some circumstances to provide such an opportunity to some of those who would be affected. Nothing I have said is therefore inconsistent with the Lord President&#8217;s conclusion that improved procedures should be introduced, or with the intention of the Scottish Civil Justice Council to address that issue. Any improved procedures should not however make it impossible to obtain orders restricting publicity on an <span style="font-style:italic">ex parte </span>basis: as the Lord President recognised, there will inevitably be circumstances in which it is necessary for such orders to be made on that basis.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">69.<marker name="tab"/>It is necessary finally to consider the application of these principles to the present case. The BBC was aware of A&#8217;s identity at all material times. It would have been free to report it, were it not for the order made by Lord Boyd under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49" uk:canonical="1981 c. 49" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1981 Act</ref>. The order therefore fell within the scope of article 10 of the Convention, as given effect by the Human Rights Act. The BBC was entitled to challenge the order as being incompatible with article 10, on the assumption that a public broadcaster such as the BBC can qualify as a &#8220;victim&#8221; of a violation of that article. In the light of the relevant case law of the European Court of Human Rights (eg <span style="font-style:italic">Radio France v France </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2004) 40 EHRR 706" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">(2004) 40 EHRR 706</ref>; <span style="font-style:italic">&#336;sterreichischer Rundfunk v Austria </span>(Application No 35841/02) (unreported) given 7 December 2006; <span style="font-style:italic">Mackay and BBC Scotland v United Kingdom </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2010) 53 EHRR 671" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">(2010) 53 EHRR 671</ref>), and in the absence of argument to the contrary, I proceed on the basis that it can. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">70.<marker name="tab"/>As I have explained, article 10 sets out a qualified guarantee: the right of freedom of expression can be subjected to restrictions which are prescribed in law and are necessary in a democratic society &#8220;for the protection of the &#8230; rights of others &#8230; or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary&#8221;. There is no doubt that an order made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> is prescribed by law.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">71.<marker name="tab"/>There are undoubtedly features of the case which support the BBC&#8217;s contention that there was at all material times a public interest in its ability to report it without restrictions. These include the fact that the case concerns the deportation of a foreign sex offender, the remarkable length of time the proceedings have taken, and the cost of the proceedings to the taxpayer. The reporting of the present case would contribute to a debate of general interest: cases concerning the deportation of foreign offenders are not infrequently reported as part of a debate about the impact of European human rights law, or about the procedure followed in such cases. It is also true that A has in the past been the subject of publicity in which his name and photograph were published. It is also undeniable that, although the BBC could report all other aspects of the case, their inability to reveal A&#8217;s identity would detract from the human or journalistic interest of the story.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">72.<marker name="tab"/>Nevertheless, the arguments in favour of Lord Boyd&#8217;s decision to make the order, and Lord Glennie&#8217;s decision not to recall it, were in my view overwhelming. It is necessary first to recall the procedural context in which those decisions were taken. The tribunal had made a decision, the effect of which was to authorise A&#8217;s deportation, and it had also made an anonymity direction on the ground that A &#8220;could be put at risk of harm by publication of [his] name and details&#8221;. Its decision to authorise A&#8217;s deportation, in the face of concerns about the risk of his being ill-treated on his return to his country of origin, had been made on the basis that anonymity would be a significant protection of his article 3 rights. Lord Boyd&#8217;s order was then made in proceedings in which the validity of the tribunal&#8217;s decision was challenged. A date had been fixed for the hearing of A&#8217;s challenge to the decision, but the Home Secretary proposed to deport A several weeks before that hearing took place. The case came before Lord Boyd so that he could decide whether the deportation should be allowed to proceed before the challenge to the tribunal&#8217;s decision had been heard. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">73.<marker name="tab"/>In that situation, the publication of A&#8217;s identity, or of information enabling him to be identified, would have subverted the basis of the tribunal&#8217;s decision to authorise his deportation. That decision had been based on an assessment that there was no real risk of a violation of article 3 if A&#8217;s identity was not publicised in connection with the deportation proceedings. The decision would have been undermined, before the challenge to its validity was determined, if his identity was published in the meantime. A fresh application to be allowed to remain in this country could then have been made on the basis of the new factual situation created by the publication of his identity in connection with the deportation proceedings. That application would then have required to be considered by the Home Secretary, and a fresh decision made. The publication of A&#8217;s identity would therefore have frustrated the judicial review proceedings before the court. Indeed, the entire proceedings since at least 2007 would have been rendered largely pointless.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">74.<marker name="tab"/>The reasons for making the order were equally compelling if considered from the perspective of protecting A&#8217;s article 3 rights in the event of his deportation. The tribunal, as the fact-finding body in this case, had accepted that A would be at serious risk of violence if his identity became known in his country of origin in connection with these proceedings, and had concluded that anonymity would be a significant protection of his article 3 rights. In those circumstances, the court&#8217;s failure to make a <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> order would, as the Lord President observed, have had the grave consequence that the deportation might create all the risks that the tribunal&#8217;s directions as to anonymity had been intended to prevent. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">75.<marker name="tab"/>In these circumstances, it was plainly necessary in the interests of justice, and in order to protect the safety of a party to the proceedings, to depart from the general principle of open justice to the extent involved in the making of the orders made by Lord Boyd. It follows that, subject to any issue arising under the Convention, the order allowing A to withhold his identity in the proceedings was in accordance with the common law, and the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> order was made in accordance with the power conferred by that provision. </p>

	<level>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">76.<marker name="tab"/>It also follows that the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1981/49/section/11" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 11</ref> order was not incompatible with the Convention rights of the BBC. The interference with its freedom of expression was necessary to maintain the authority and impartiality of the judiciary, since its publication of A&#8217;s identity in connection with the proposed deportation would have completely undermined the judicial review proceedings. In these circumstances, where the publication of A&#8217;s identity in connection with the proceedings might well have rendered those proceedings pointless, the interference with the BBC&#8217;s article 10 rights was unavoidable if the authority and impartiality of the judiciary, within the meaning of article 10(2), were to be maintained. Put shortly, the order had to be made if the court was to do its job, notwithstanding the resulting restriction upon the BBC&#8217;s capacity to do its job. The interference with the BBC&#8217;s article 10 rights was also necessary for the protection of the rights of others, namely the right of A not to be subjected to violent attack. As Lord Rodger observed in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Guardian News and Media Ltd </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2010/1" uk:canonical="[2010] UKSC 1" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] UKSC 1</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 2 AC 697" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 2 AC 697</ref>, para 27, the media do not have the right to publish information at the known potential cost of an individual being killed or maimed.</p>

As I have explained, that application was due to be heard by the court on 9 November 2012, only two days after the order had been made. With the BBC&#8217;s agreement, that hearing was postponed until 14 November 2012, when Lord Glennie heard the BBC&#8217;s application over the course of two days. He concluded that the order was justified and should not be recalled. For the reasons I have explained, that decision was correct. The procedure that was followed in my opinion satisfied the BBC&#8217;s entitlement under the Convention to an effective remedy.</p>
