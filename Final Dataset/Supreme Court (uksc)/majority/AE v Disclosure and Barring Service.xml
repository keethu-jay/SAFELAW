At the time in question the Appellant would stay over at Ellie&#8217;s house for one or two nights once a fortnight. She did not visit him as he lived in hospital accommodation associated with his job as a mental health support worker. In about December 2021 Ellie introduced the Appellant to Molly and to her other foster child, a younger boy.</span></p>

On that occasion there had been a barbecue in the garden with friends and those present had been drinking alcohol. Ellie promptly reported Molly&#8217;s disclosure to the police and her statement to the police (dated 13 June 2023) included the following passage:</span></p>

She said, "[the Appellant] kissed me and now he keeps following me upstairs." I asked her questions I said was it fatherly or a passionate and she said, "It was just a quick peck on the lips and it was just once." I said that's not OK but at that point I thought it may have been a fatherly kiss. I gave her a cuddle and said I would speak to him. She then went to bed. </span></p>

She said, "It wasn't just once that [the Appellant] kissed me it was several times." I said, "I thought it was a fatherly kiss." She said, "I thought you would know as he kept following me upstairs." I asked if she knew how many times and she said she didn&#8217;t know. I asked, "When was the last time?&#8217; She said, "The last time that he came down." This was just before Christmas as he'd told me that he had been training so I haven't physically seen him.</span></p>

He maintained that there was no sexual motive to the kiss. However, he described the kiss at the birthday celebrations as not the type that he would give to his own daughter and reported to feeling &#8220;not good about it&#8221; and &#8220;haunted&#8221;. Molly provided an ABE interview but did not engage with the interviewing officer(s), following which the CPS decided to take no further action in relation to the incident. </span></p>

We therefore had ample opportunity to assess the Appellant&#8217;s oral evidence, albeit we accept it was given in a stressful environment. We also recognise that the Appellant may not have been speaking in his first language.

In particular, the Appellant was very vague about the circumstances surrounding the incident at the birthday party in June 2022, meaning that on the balance of probabilities we attached greater weight to the evidence from the police statements in the summer of 2023, being closer in point of time.</span></p>

When the officer probed gently about what had happened next, Mollie replied &#8220;I don&#8217;t really remember much&#8221; (p.88).

The fact that Molly was mostly unco-operative in her ABE interview may well be accounted for by her young age and the emotional trauma she had experienced (including the effective breakdown of her most recent long-term foster placement). There may well be other reasons (e.g. the oppressive nature of a police interview room). So, the mere fact that in her ABE interview Molly did not repeat to the officer the precise disclosure she had made to Ellie does not assist the Appellant &#8211; not least as he himself has admitted that he had kissed Molly on her lips, as we shall see.</span></p>

At first, he said he could not say how long his lips were on Molly&#8217;s or whether his mouth was open or closed (p.48). As the questioning in his police interview unfolded, he admitted that when he kissed Molly his mouth was open (p.48). The Appellant also stated in his police interview that he &#8220;didn&#8217;t feel good&#8221; about what had happened and that he should be &#8220;a responsible person&#8221; (p.49). He went on to say that the kiss was something he &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t have done that if I&#8217;m in control of myself&#8221; (p.52). He also distinguished between past kisses and the one at the birthday party: &#8220;Oh that time, sir, I have given a kiss, not like, it&#8217;s not like that, the one of, when I said I was on the alcohol &#8211; all the other times were not like that&#8221; (p.49); &#8220;&#8230;this particular one is the one that I believe &#8211; the other ones, that&#8217;s why I said intention of, intention is also important&#8230;&#8221; (p.50). However, he admitted to having kissed her on the lips more than once (p.50). When asked whether he had sexual feelings towards Molly when he kissed her he did not deny it, saying instead &#8220;I was under the influence of alcohol, I cannot&#8230;&#8217; (p.52). When asked in his police interview whether he had ever kissed his own daughter like he kissed Molly that day, he replied in the negative (p.53). When asked why alcohol would make him kiss Molly like he would kiss his partner the Appellant was silent (p.54). When asked by the police whether he would be happy if an adult kissed</span> his <span style="font-family:Arial">daughter in the way he had kissed Molly, the Appellant said &#8220;&#8230;that&#8217;s why I said here, as a person, I don&#8217;t feel good about it&#8221; (p.58). As the line of questioning further unfolded, the Appellant said that his conscience had been &#8220;haunting him since that time&#8221; (p.59). When pressed by the police about why he felt bad about his actions that day, the Appellant said: &#8220;&#8230;to put my mouth together like that inside her mouth, that&#8217;s what I wouldn&#8217;t (inaudible) it&#8217;s not something I would want to do&#8221; and that it happened &#8220;because I couldn&#8217;t control myself at that&#8221; (p.74). The Appellant was asked twice whether he felt bad because the kiss had a sexual element to it. On both occasions his response was to deflect the question, saying, &#8220;You interpret it [like that]&#8221; (pp.74-75). </span></p>

He also denied having said in his police interview that he had kissed Molly in the same way as he would kiss his partner. He admitted that he seemed &#8220;to have a light brain regarding alcohol&#8221;, referring to a work colleague&#8217;s leaving party in 2019 when &#8220;I was made to understand though jokes the following day at work that I was drunk&#8221; on that occasion. The Appellant further explained as follows in his representations:</span></p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-family:Arial">That I have acted in a manner that is now interpreted as sexual towards Molly as a result of being drunk, which I know cannot happen in my clear eyes, makes me feel really bad with myself. I remember that the next day after the party, I was shown videos that were taken of me where in some of them; it appeared like I have passed out. In one of the videos, I realised that Molly has coloured my face with paint, which I did not even know when that happened. In another video, it looked like Molly was trying to make me an object of laughter. She was trying to stuff something into my mouth and nose, and I was reacting to that and was thinking that it was [Rover] (Ellie&#8217;s dog) that was messing up with me. I was saying &#8220;[Rover] leave me alone.&#8221; When I saw those videos, I was so embarrassed and really ashamed of myself. Therefore, relating this event with my past experience at a colleagues&#8217; send-off party, has made me to realise that in a situation of being drunk, I can do some senseless things. This is the reason that I accepted that I may have kissed Molly. And since this came to my knowledge, it has been haunting me, and I have not been happy with myself. Since then, I have made up my mind to totally give up any drink that contains alcohol.</span></p>

After completing his training in the UK, he had worked from 2017 as a nursing assistant in a psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU).

He had met her in 2021 but did not meet her foster children for several months after first meeting her. When asked to describe his relationship with Molly, he replied that he could not say it was good. He described her as being a bit withdrawn from the beginning, in contrast to Ellie&#8217;s foster son, who was very open and friendly with him from the outset. The Appellant said that he was trying to act as a father to them both and was doing his best to make Molly accept him in the way that her foster sibling did: &#8220;I tried to encourage her with school when she was moody. I would give her a hug or a peck on the cheek to cheer her up.&#8221;  He said that he would hug her in the same way he would hug her sibling.

I accept kissing her on the lips on this one occasion and that was wrong, but it was not a passionate kiss, and I did not have any sexual intention.

He said that he did not have a very clear recollection but he conceded he had kissed Molly on the mouth. Ms Hartley then asked him about the telephone conversations with Ellie after Molly&#8217;s disclosure. Ms Hartley asked whether he accepted that on the first call he had not answered Ellie&#8217;s question right away: &#8220;I accept I didn&#8217;t respond immediately &#8230; it was a shocking thing to hear.&#8221; He denied that the real reason he had not replied immediately was that he was shocked the incident had come out. </span></p>

When asked whether it was appropriate to kiss an 11- or 12-year-old on the mouth with one&#8217;s mouth open, the Appellant answered &#8220;It&#8217;s not something I would ordinarily want to do. I&#8217;m not happy with the suggestion that it&#8217;s sexual.&#8221; He accepted that he would not want someone else to kiss his own daughter like that. In answer to a direct question, the Appellant expressly denied having put his tongue in Molly&#8217;s mouth. However, given his hazy recollection he had some difficulty in explaining this categorical denial: &#8220;I would not like to think I would do that. It&#8217;s not possible.

This finding is not itself in dispute. The Appellant accepted (at the very least) that he would from time-to-time kiss Molly by way of a peck on the cheek &#8216;to encourage her&#8217;. Furthermore, there is in fact a glaring inconsistency in the Appellant&#8217;s evidence as to the details of these interactions which is a further example of the unsatisfactory nature of some of his evidence. On the one hand, he acknowledged in his police interview that there had indeed been other occasions on which he had kissed Molly on the lips. Thus, the officer asked him &#8220;Have you kissed Molly on the lips more than once? And let&#8217;s just start with this one &#8211; have you kissed Molly on the lips more than once?&#8221;. The Appellant&#8217;s response to this unambiguous question was a simple &#8220;Yes&#8221; (p.50). Yet on the other hand, in his witness statement, he strenuously denied this very same allegation &#8211; see paragraph 41 above. Whichever is the true position, the fact remains that there is a clear admission that the Appellant kissed Molly in some way on multiple occasions over the relevant period. In that regard we find there is no mistake of fact by the DBS in making that first finding.</span></p>

There is a world of difference between that type of kiss and the &#8216;peck on the cheek&#8217; type of kiss. Indeed, we find it hard to contemplate any situation in which an adult&#8217;s kiss on the lips with an open mouth is other than a sexual act. There are a number of features of the evidence which persuade us that the Appellant realised that he had &#8216;crossed a line&#8217; in kissing Molly in the way he did during the birthday party. For example, the Appellant had refused to answer Ellie when she had asked him whether he had kissed Molly more than once. He also asked Ellie by text for forgiveness, a further acknowledgement that he had overstepped a boundary. Furthermore, the Appellant made several damning admissions about his conduct in his police interview.</span></p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The Respondent argues, moreover, that the evidence points to the Appellant having a sexual interest in children. Ms Hartley submitted that this was the most likely explanation for the inconsistencies in the Appellant&#8217;s evidence. We understand how the DBS has arrived at that conclusion and cannot say that they have made a mistake of fact in reaching that assessment. However, for ourselves we are not confident enough to make a finding that the Appellant does indeed have a sexual interest in children. In that context we note that the Appellant&#8217;s devices were removed for forensic analysis in June 2023 (p.107) but no results are provided in the documentation in the appeal bundle. We think it is a reasonable assumption that this means that there was nothing of any significance found on the Appellant&#8217;s mobile phones or laptops. Absent any such further incriminating evidence, we would not ourselves find that the Appellant has a sexual interest in children. However, this does not assist the Appellant in this appeal for two reasons. First, as already noted, we cannot say that the DBS have made any mistake of fact. Second, and in any event, the core finding of fact is that the kiss in question was sexual in nature and again that finding involves no material mistake of fact.</span></p>

On the DBS&#8217;s findings, the conduct of a sexual nature related solely to a child &#8211; no complaint of inappropriate sexual conduct had been made in respect of any adults at all, let alone vulnerable adults, and so the concern was not transferable. Mr Wills argued that any decision to bar for the purposes of the adults barred list had to be based on evidence, not hypotheticals, and accordingly the DBS&#8217;s decision was disproportionate. As such, he submitted, it involved an error of law.</span></p>

Furthermore, the bar for irrationality is a high one, being &#8220;a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it&#8221; (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">CCSU v Minister for Civil Service</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1985] AC 374" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1985">[1985] AC 374</ref> at p.410 </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">per </span><span style="font-family:Arial">Lord Diplock).

These four requirements are logically separate, but in practice they inevitably overlap because the same facts are likely to be relevant to more than one of them.
