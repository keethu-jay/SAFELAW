In her witness statement she stated that she had been acting as a foster carer since 2007 looking after young people from a number of countries including Afghanistan, Eritrea, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Albania and Kosovo.  In all she had cared for over nine young people and most of her placements had lasted on average for three years.  She also would offer respite care and out of hours emergency care.  She said that her first impression of the claimant was that he looked much older than the age that he claimed to be and that she had felt uncomfortable around him.  When she took him to the GP, or the shopping centre, she would always get comments that he was much older and that he looked too old to be a foster child.  When she had taken him to the Refugee Council she had spoken to someone who had told her that the claimant had been coming there for the last three months and that the claimant had told him that he was older than the age he claimed to be and laughed about managing to get into care.  She had been told that he was a new arrival and this was clearly not true.  She went on to say that he did everything for himself and by himself and she did not have to show him very much in the house.  She believed that he was more responsible and mature for his claimed age compared to other young people that she had fostered over the years and that she had not felt right having him in her home.</span></p>

In his statement he said that he had almost ten years&#8217; UK post-qualification experience of working with children and families including five and a half years&#8217; experience in the children looked after, family support and child protection team as well as four and a half years&#8217; experience with unaccompanied asylum seeking-children.  He said that he had taken part in the age assessment on 25 April 2013 as part of his duties and that he had been conducting age assessments since 15 March 2010 &#8211; on average two each month.  About 40% of the assessment duties conducted were on young persons from Sudan or Somalia.  He conducted the assessment with a colleague, Ken Facey.  It was a full &#8220;</span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Courier New'">Merton</span><span style="font-family:'Courier New'"> compliant&#8221; assessment in which they were guided by their own knowledge of child development and experience of working with young people of the same or a similar ethnic background.  He said that at the first assessment the claimant was given the benefit of the doubt as his appearance, presentation and demeanour during interview might not have given sufficient evidence to draw a logical conclusion regarding his age.  His approach had, however, been holistic and the decision was made in the absence of any material evidence.  He said that he was of the view that the claimant could have suffered physical and emotional neglect following the death of his father that might have explained why his physical appearance suggested to them that he was older than his claimed age.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in"><span style="font-family:'Courier New'">It was sometimes the case that assessments had to be reviewed when other information came to light.  In this case new evidence had come from UKBA on 31 May and therefore the decision had been reviewed.  On 19 June 2013 he and Mr Facey had met with the claimant at the review age assessment.  He said that the claimant was given an opportunity to respond to new evidence which they had received from UKBA and during that meeting the claimant had confirmed that he had spent a brief period of time in Italy.  He had considered that the evidence given by the claimant was inconsistent and that therefore there were issues regarding the claimant&#8217;s credibility and that the information which they had regarding the claimant&#8217;s journey to Britain undermined the veracity of the claimant&#8217;s account during the age assessment interview and suggested he was not the age he claimed to be.  In the statement he went on to say that before arriving at conclusions following the review he and Ken Facey had consulted with other professionals who had been involved with the claimant and took the views of the claimant&#8217;s allocated social worker and had read the independent reviewing officer&#8217;s report of 5 June.  On 18 June 2013 he was informed by Susan Akingbeme that her impression of the claimant was that he was not a child but an adult.  It was that information together with the minutes of the LAC chair review report written by Liston Williams which said that &#8220;the chair would support another age assessment which would culminate in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Courier New'">the claimant&#8217;s</span><span style="font-family:'Courier New'"> transfer to the adult services as soon as possible&#8221; that had lead to the review - the manager, Cynthia Winifred, had made that decision because of the new information.  He said on 19 June he and Ken Facey had given the claimant the opportunity to respond to the views of his social worker and those expressed by Liston Williams in his report and that the claimant had maintained that he was 15 years old.

The issue of shaving was put to her and she said that that was not a particularly relevant factor.  It was put to her that it was not until 19 June that the claimant was told that there was a decision to review his age but in fact that decision and indeed the decision that he was an adult had been made the previous day.  Ms Akingbeme stated that the issue of age had been an ongoing concern raised by the reviewing officer and two foster carers.  It was not a sudden decision.  She was asked what the purpose of the meeting on 19 June was and she replied that that was something which should be put to Mr Oyeleye.  It was put to her that the procedure was unfair and she said that this was an issue that should be improved in the future.</span></p>

She was surprised that he was considered to be 15 and that he was placed in a household with young people much younger than he.  She questioned his age with the foster carer and asked to see the documents provided by the social worker.  She said that from her experience of working with young people the claimant looked much older &#8211; at least over 20.  She said that the foster carer had stated that at times the young people felt uneasy around the claimant both of whom had raised concerns about the claimant and were happy when told that he was to be moving downstairs.  The foster carer&#8217;s own children, who were aged 12 and 10, were also uneasy.  As a safeguarding arrangement the sleeping arrangements were changed so the claimant would sleep downstairs. </span></p>

When asked in cross examination  why that was not in the notes and she said that she could have been mistaken.  In any event she accepted that it was not necessarily indicative of age.  He also wanted his share of the fostering allowance and asked for extra money but would not say what it was for.  He had said that his pocket money was that for a child and &#8220;not for someone like him&#8221; but did not say exactly what he meant.  She added in her statement that he was an accomplished smoker referring to the manner in which the claimant smoked, held cigarettes and would extinguish them and she said that she had noted that his pupils appeared dilated on two of the four occasions that she saw him.  She said that his Adam&#8217;s apple appeared quite prominent, which could indicate physical maturity.  She went on to say that the claimant found it difficult to be treated in any way as a young person of his claimed age and there did not appear to be the usual difficulties of adolescent behaviour but he behaved as an adult speaking to another adult.  She stated that he did not need to appear any form of additional care which a 15 year old child would require.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in"><span style="font-family:'Courier New'">In her oral evidence Ms Constable relied on her statement and was then asked about the notes which purportedly came from the diary and telephone of Mrs Weldegebriel.  She confirmed that she had created the notes when she had been asked by Croydon&#8217;s legal department for the notes relating to the claimant.  The actual notes which had been kept in a folder which had been handed over to the social worker when the placement had ended in 2013 had disappeared and she therefore spoke to Mrs Weldegebriel in an attempt to reconstruct the diary.  Two folders had been handed over, that relating to the appointments made with doctors, a dentist, the Refugee Council and so on and the other relating to informal notes relating to matters which would not normally be disclosed to the child in care.  The first set of notes would, however, go with him when he left care as a record of, for example, illnesses down to minutiae such as when a child had a headache or was given paracetamol.  She said that the carer had told her that she had given the papers to the social worker but had then been given part of the folder to give to the young person.  The social worker should not have done this as it should have gone back to Social Services: the social worker should keep both parts if the young person leaves care and would hand over the second part if the child stayed in care.  She had created the notes around 7 July 2014 after having asked the carer whether or not she had her appointment diary and for other notes.  She accepted that on occasions she had had to prompt Mrs Weldegebriel.  She was also able to look at the text messages sent to her but she had not kept these as Croydon has changed the phone which she carried.  She said that she had left blanks where Mrs Weldegebriel could not recall something.</span></p>

Twice she had seen the claimant on Carolina Road &#8211; the road where the claimant had lived with Mrs Weldegebriel.  On those occasions she had been visiting other carers in that road.  However, prior to the placement she had seen the claimant, she believed, standing with other young men in Portland Road, South Norwood.  They had blocked her way before allowing her to pass.  She described the young men as towering over her and she thought that the claimant was one of them.  She said that she had had to look up at them and that he might have been smoking.  She said that that had not been put into her statement because she had not been asked about it.  She referred to two other occasions when she had seen the claimant on the street firstly coming out of the carer&#8217;s house and secondly at the corner shop with the foster carer&#8217;s son and another child in care from Eritrea called Mehane.</span></p>

Asked why she had said that he was an accomplished smoker she said that she knew how people who smoked regularly behaved as opposed to those who just have the odd cigarette.  It was the claimant&#8217;s mannerisms that made her feel that he was older. She was asked why she had said that the claimant&#8217;s pupils were dilated and she said that that was what she had seen although she accepted that on that occasion she had been on the other side of the road.

I now propose to amplify that chronology and to deal in greater detail with the various reports which were relevant to the assessment of the claimant&#8217;s age. When setting out the terms of the reports I have briefly commented on the weight to be placed on each.  The first document is the UKBA referral to Child Welfare Services dated 3 April 2013.  It gave the claimant&#8217;s date of birth as 15 December 1994 but stated that that age was disputed.  A letter of that date to the claimant gives that date of birth in the heading but noted that he had claimed that his date of birth was 15 December 1997.  The letter stated that that claimed date of birth was not accepted.  However, as his physical appearance/demeanour &#8220;does not very strongly suggest that you are significantly over 18 years of age&#8221; UKBA would treat him according to the process designed for the handling of asylum claims from children.</span></p>

While the report referred to the necessity of a holistic assessment of the claimant&#8217;s age it referred to the further evidence which had been received from the Home Office regarding the claim made in Italy and it was considered that the claimant had been dishonest because he had given conflicting names and dates of birth.  What is of concern is that the claimant appears to have been called to the review without being informed that his care arrangements were about to be changed, there was no independent adult there and there seems to have been no way in which he was given a chance to respond to the information that had been put to him.  The reality appears to be that the review was the way in which the claimant was told that his care was to come to an end.

Moreover, the route which the claimant gave showing his journey to Britain via Greece and Italy is a well-trodden path for asylum seekers. I note that there is no record of his being fingerprinted in Greece or of his having made a claim there, but having noted the evidence of Anastasia Papanastasiou, who is a member of the appeals committee of the asylum service in Greece regarding  the somewhat chaotic procedures in Greece, the fact that there is no evidence  of the claimant having been fingerprinted there as he claimed is not, I consider, significant.  What is relevant, however, is that there is considerable evidence not only from Ms Papanastasiou but also from relevant case law which indicates that asylum seekers in Greece may well be mistreated and indeed mistreated in the ways which the appellant claimed. I therefore find that the claimant had travelled through Greece as he had claimed and that he did enter Italy by boat.</span></p>

That shows a minor but not fatal mistake in the Italian authorities&#8217; recordkeeping.  Chad and South Sudan share a border and indeed part of South Sudan appears to &#8220;bulge&#8221; into Chad.  However, as following Peter Verney&#8217;s report I have concluded that the claimant is not from Chad I consider that the information in the Italian record is wrong. I have also found that it is unlikely that the claimant entered at Italy by air.

I note the evidence of the two other witnesses from Khutum that little weight was put on either dates of birth or birthdays in South Sudan and effectively that an assessment of age whether at the khuram, the religious school attached to the mosque, or for any other purposes was of little importance.  Although ZH stated that he had a birth certificate it appears that his family were given the document because he was born in a hospital in Nyala.  He could recall little about that document and indeed the date was written in the Muslim calendar.  II&#8217;s comment was that he knew his date of birth because he had been born in Ramadan and therefore each Ramadan he knew he was one year older.  That did not specifically indicate that he knew his exact date of birth or indeed his exact age although it appears that his date of birth has been accepted by the Home Office and by the defendant.  The claimant said that his father was illiterate although he could do simple arithmetic for business purposes but I consider that it is highly improbable that the claimant was asked by the sheikh who ran the religious school for his date of birth and that his father wrote it on a piece of paper. In all, I therefore do not accept that the claimant was correct when he stated that he knew his date of birth because it had been written down by his father.

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in"><span style="font-family:'Courier New'">Ms Constable emphasised in her statement that the claimant was irritable around young people.  That is in the notes which she prepared.  However, it is not reflected in the assessment made when the claimant was visited at the carer&#8217;s house where it was said that he appeared to get on well with the other children in the house.  Similarly her claim that the claimant was an &#8220;accomplished smoker&#8221; really did not stand up in cross-examination.  On the first of the four occasions on which she saw him and she thought he might be smoking she was not certain that it was he and indeed not certain that he was smoking.  She also stated that he had towered over her which taking into account her own height of five foot six and the height of the claimant at about five foot eight according to the age assessment and the fact that Ms Akingbeme described him as about five foot five, that  would not have been the case.  Although she stated that she had seen him with his eyes dilated that appeared to be when she had seen him across the road and cannot possibly be correct.  The reality is that there was nothing on which she could base the assertion in her statement that he was an accomplished smoker and indeed Mrs Weldegebriel had said that she had not seen the claimant smoke although she had smelled smoke on him &#8211; something that no other witnesses apart from Ms Constable and Ms Akingbeme had said.  The reality is that I consider Ms Constable was alert to the concerns of Mrs Weldegebriel regarding moving the claimant downstairs and made arrangements for that but that her notes of the meeting at the carer&#8217;s home give absolutely no indication that the claimant had the behaviour patterns of an adult.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in"><span style="font-family:'Courier New'">Similarly while I accept that Mrs Weldegebriel felt that the claimant was much older than he claimed to be I consider that the notes which claimed to be a reconstruction of her folder were not in fact such a reconstruction. It was clear from her evidence that she was uneasy at the various matters being put to her regarding the claimant&#8217;s domestic skills and confidence outside the house. I prefer the evidence of Mrs Ross regarding the immaturity of the claimant but the strongest evidence is that of Mr Khan who actually lived with the claimant for some time and considered that his domestic skills were undeveloped even for someone of his claimed age.  I also note that it was asserted that the claimant had stated that the carer&#8217;s allowance should be paid to him but there is no contemporaneous note to back up that assertion and from the contemporaneous notes it is clear that the only monetary issue related to the Oyster card and the payment for it - the claimant had had to pay for travel when that was not part of the money which was for his personal use. </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in"><span style="font-family:'Courier New'">While I have noted the statement of Mr Liston Williams he did not give evidence before me and I consider that I can place little weight thereon.  Again it was a statement prepared long after the events which had taken place and does not reflect what was in his LAC report.  There is in particular the statement in the report that the claimant had asked that his family be traced through the Red Cross whereas the reality is that the claimant has always said that his parents and family were killed.  That statement does not fit in with the notes prepared by Ron Braeger of the Refugee Council who was present.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in"><span style="font-family:'Courier New'">In all, when I consider the various factors on which to assess the claimant&#8217;s age I conclude that the claimant was not at the time of the assessment an adult. I have not accepted the Eurodac evidence as being accurate in anything but the fact that the Clamant was fingerprinted in Italy. For the reasons given I place greater weight on the evidence of Mrs Ross who considers that the claimant is a suitable companion for her 15 year old son, Ms Johnson and Ms Bell as well as Mr Ayub Khan &#8211; the people who have seen him over long periods of time and seen his interact with other children of his age rather than the defendant&#8217;s witnesses. I also place weight on the evidence of the two young men who had known the claimant in Khutum.  In particular I note ZH&#8217;s assessment that he was the same age as HMHH, the claimant&#8217;s brother.   </span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in"><span style="font-family:'Courier New'">I would add that I did not consider that the evidence put forward by the defendant was persuasive partially because the statements and the reconstruction of the social work folder which Mrs Weldegebriel handed over was made some considerable time after the event but also because I consider that there was a certain amount of prompting between the legal department in Croydon and Ms Constable when her statement was prepared and when the notes were then &#8220;reconstructed&#8221;.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.59in"><span style="font-family:'Courier New'">I would add that I am concerned about the procedures at Croydon which led to the reassessment.  It seems to me that the reality was that a decision had been made to reassess the claimant as an adult before the reassessment took place and the claimant was given no opportunity to refute the reasons for the reassessment. I do not consider that it was appropriate that the reassessment should have been taking place without a suitable adult present to support the claimant. Indeed I note that the letter from the local authority of 15 January 2014 to the claimant&#8217;s solicitors stated:-</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.62in"><span style="font-family:'Courier New'">I would also add that I am concerned about the way in which the various statements in this case were prepared.  In particular the statements which were prepared for the two minor witnesses for the claimant who were approached direct and not through an appropriate adult, were apparently asked questions over the phone and then presented with a document to sign which was in English and which was not translated for them and which they not given any opportunity to question.  I would add also that it is apparent from the file that the defendant wished to reconsider the assessment and I consider that the claimant&#8217; representatives were wrong to reject the further assessment which was proposed by the defendant in January 2014.  However, the reality is that the reassessment of 19 June 2013 was, I consider, flawed because the claimant had no-one with him when he was reassessed.</span></p>
