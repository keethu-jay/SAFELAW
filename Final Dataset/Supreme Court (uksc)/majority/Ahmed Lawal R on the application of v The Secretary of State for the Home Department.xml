      <p><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">For the applicant:</span><marker name="tab"/><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Ms S Naik QC, Mr R Halim and Mr S Clark, instructed by Duncan Lewis Solicitors</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">For the respondent:</span><marker name="tab"/><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Mr C Thomann, instructed by the Government Legal Department</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><br/><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">(1) In considering the Strasbourg caselaw as to the extent of the Article 2 procedural duty to investigate a suspicious death (including a death that occurs whilst in immigration detention in the United Kingdom), it is important to bear in mind that the ECtHR is concerned with the entirety of the process, beginning with the initial steps to secure evidence and ending with the actual investigation or trial.  Although the investigation or trial must be conducted with the requisite degree of independence, it by no means follows that the duty to secure evidence cannot involve those such as the Secretary of State for the Home Department and her service providers, who will not be conducting the subsequent independent investigations.  On the contrary, given that, in the context of a death in detention, the service providers and the Secretary of State&#8217;s relevant officials at the detention centre will inevitably be the first on the scene, they clearly must take the initial steps to secure evidence.  This is so, irrespective of the fact that, in order of likely appearance, the police, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman&#8217;s investigators and HM Coroner will also become actively involved.  </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">(2) Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that the ECtHR has been at pains to state that the steps to be taken are &#8220;reasonable&#8221; ones.  What is reasonable will depend, not only on the circumstances of the death but also the nature and purpose of the detention facility, such as whether it is holding individuals who face removal by the Secretary of State from the United Kingdom, in pursuance of her functions, conferred by Parliament, of enforcing immigration controls.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">(3) The irreducible minimum obligations of the Secretary of State in this area are:</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">(a) to take immediate steps to ascertain whether any detainee has evidence to give regarding the death in detention; </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">(b) to record, or facilitate the recording of, a statement of such evidence; </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">(c) to determine whether the individual is willing to give evidence at the inquest; </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">(d) to record relevant contact details of the individual, including in the country of proposed removal; and</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> (e) to consider the practicability of the individual giving evidence at the inquest either (i) by returning to the United Kingdom for that purpose or (ii) by giving evidence by means of video-link.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">(4) The Detention Services Order 08/2014: Death in Immigration Detention (August 2020) fails  adequately to address the vital function of detention centre staff in identifying those detainees who, because of physical proximity to the deceased or other known associations, are likely to have relevant information, whether or not they have chosen to come forward of their own accord. The current policy of the Secretary of State is, therefore, not compliant with Article 2 in its procedural form.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">(5) The Secretary of State&#8217;s present policy framework is also legally deficient in that there is nothing in her policy concerning removals; namely Judicial Reviews and Injunctions &#8211; Version 20.0 (10 October 2019), which guides her immigration officials to act compliantly with Article 2 in its procedural form, when making decisions as to the removal of an individual.</span></p>

He was 36 years old. Mr Okwurime (hereafter &#8220;OO&#8221;) was being detained by the respondent, in order to effect OO&#8217;s removal to Nigeria. The claimant, also a national of Nigeria, was at that time also in detention at Gauze House. </span></p>

An inquest hearing, before a jury and Mrs Lydia Brown, Coroner, was held on 13 November 2020. The record of the inquest states that OO died of a spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage at approximately 2300 hours on 11 September 2019, having last been seen alive at 2100 hours on 11 September. The jury&#8217;s conclusion as to the death of OO was as follows:-</span></p>

Mr Oscar Lucky Okwurime died of a spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage which can rupture due to hypertension. His blood pressure reading on 22 August 2019 demonstrated Grade II hypertension. This reading was not repeated due to multiple failures to adhere to healthcare policy. Given the multiple opportunities to repeat this basic medical test on a vulnerable person, neglect contributed to the death.&#8221;</span></p>

Dr Bates told the jury that his post-mortem examination of OO disclosed that OO had coronary artery disease, in the form of atheroma (hardening of the arteries). Dr Bates said it was common in his experience for people to die very rapidly of subarachnoid haemorrhage. It was therefore entirely consistent with the cause of death that OO collapsed, was unconscious and died fairly rapidly. </span></p>

Witness statements were settled, setting out the detainees&#8217; knowledge and awareness of the circumstances of OO&#8217;s death and what matters they wish to speak about in this regard. It appears to be common ground that, as at 16 September, no statements had been taken by the service provider (or anyone else) from any detainee at Gauze House, concerning OO&#8217;s death. This included the detainee known as Mr Ullah, who occupied the room next to that of OO. </span></p>

The applicant&#8217;s grounds were accompanied by a witness statement from Toufique Hossain, Director of Public Law at Duncan Lewis, stating that the applicant knew OO &#8220;very well&#8221; and that he had evidence to give as to the efforts made by OO to get an appointment with healthcare in the weeks prior to OO&#8217;s death. The applicant&#8217;s own witness statement said that there were no hourly checks on rooms during the night in question and that around 11pm the applicant heard a lot of banging coming from where OO&#8217;s cell was located. The applicant understood that OO was screaming and shouting, that he was banging on his door and also pressing the buzzer/alarm in his room. The applicant could hear all this noise from his own cell.</span></p>

Subsequently, the PPO advised that she did not require the assistance of any further detainees, in connection with her investigation into OO&#8217;s death, but statements would be accepted from any detainee who felt that they had information relevant to her investigation.</span></p>

On 15 January 2020, the applicant filed and served a reply to the summary grounds. The applicant contended that his removal would render him non-compellable as a witness and thus materially impair the effectiveness of the pending coronial inquest and, thus, the discharge of the respondent&#8217;s procedural obligation under Article 2 of the ECHR.</span></p>

The emphasis of the letter was, nevertheless, on the respondent&#8217;s removal powers. Nothing appears to have been said by the coroner by way of reply to the respondent&#8217;s letter before 9 September 2020, when the coroner produced a list of witnesses for the inquest. That list did not include the applicant.

So far as the applicant&#8217;s evidence is concerned, relevant information is to be found in the witness statements of Amanda Hoad, of the Government Legal Service, who attended the inquest between 13 November and 7 December 2020; and in the witness statements of Jamie Bell of Duncan Lewis Solicitors. Despite the criticisms made by Ms Hoad and Mr Bell of each other&#8217;s evidence, we consider that, together, they are likely to have given a useful account of what transpired at the hearing. In his evidence to the jury, the applicant said he heard a call bell go off. However, computerised records showed that no call bells in G25 or G26 (respectively, OO&#8217;s, Mr Ullah&#8217;s rooms) had been activated in the evening in question. The applicant also gave evidence to say that he heard what had been shouted. When asked why he had not mentioned details about that in his initial witness statement, when his memory was fresh, the applicant was unable to answer. He then appeared to say that this was because he was told it by somebody else. </span></p>

The Government have drawn attention to the fact that this witness had, in any event, submitted two statements and that there is no indication that he had anything different or additional to add. However, the Court notes that he was not available for questions to be put to him on matters which might have required further detail or clarification or enabled any inconsistency or omissions in that account to be tested. The applicants had argued in their observations on admissibility that the evidence of the witnesses on the scene at the prison had been of particular importance since it potentially concerned the timing and duration of the attack (see the decision of admissibility in this case of 7 June 2001) and therefore might disclose matters relevant to their claims for damages.</span></p>

The essential purpose of such an investigation is to secure the effective implementation of the domestic laws safeguarding the right to life and, in those cases involving state agents or bodies, to ensure their accountability for deaths occurring under their responsibility. However, the investigation should also be broad enough to permit the investigating authorities to take into consideration not only the actions of the state agents who directly used lethal force but also all the surrounding circumstances, including such matters as the planning and control of the operations in question, where this is necessary in order to determine whether the state complied with its obligation under art 2 to protect life.</span></p>

The purposes of such an investigation are clear: to ensure so far as possible that the full facts are brought to light; that culpable and discreditable conduct is exposed and brought to public notice; that suspicion of deliberate wrongdoing (if unjustified) is allayed; that dangerous practices and procedures are rectified; and that those who have lost their relative may at least have the satisfaction of knowing that lessons learned from his death may save the lives of others.</span></p>

Paragraph 2 states that supply centre managers are responsible for developing, implementing and maintaining their own local contingency plans and protocols for handling the aftermath of a death in detention. Plans should be renewed annually or in the event of a death. Once a death has been confirmed, the centre supplier must immediately report the death to the Home Office.

It concerns the earlier death in detention at Morton Hall of Mr Carlington Spencer, whose inquest was held in 2019. An application by Ms Naik to file a letter of 27 August 2020 from the Senior Coroner of the County of Lincolnshire to the Secretary of State for the Home Office was made on the first day of the hearing. It arose because the Carlington Spencer inquest had been mentioned in Mr Thomann&#8217;s skeleton argument. In compliance with directions made at the hearing, Ms Hardy has filed a witness statement in which she regrets that the coroner&#8217;s letter of 27 August was not referred to in her earlier witness statement.

Although the investigation or trial must be conducted with the requisite degree of independence, it by no means follows that the duty to secure evidence cannot involve those such as the respondent and her service providers, who will not be conducting the subsequent independent investigations. On the contrary, given that, in the context of a death in detention, the service providers and the relevant officials of the respondent at the detention centre will inevitably be the first on the scene, they clearly must take the initial steps to secure evidence. This is so, irrespective of the fact that, in order of likely appearance, the police, the PPO&#8217;s investigators and the coroner will also become actively involved. </span></p>

The court was there concerned with the respondent&#8217;s so-called &#8220;removal window&#8221; policy. The court held that the policy was unlawful because &#8220;an irregular migrant who applies for deferral [of the removal window] and is refused within the removal window &#8211; as will almost always be the case &#8211; will be at immediate risk of removal, without having had an opportunity of challenging the refusal in a claim for judicial review &#8230; before a court or tribunal&#8221; (Hickinbottom LJ, paragraph 142). Consequently, at that point there was &#8220;a real risk of denial of access to justice&#8221; (ibid). Ms Naik urged us to follow the analysis adopted by Hickinbottom LJ in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">FB,</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> rather than the approach adopted by the Court of Appeal in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">R (BF) (Eritrea)) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2019/872" uk:canonical="[2019] EWCA Civ 872" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2019">[2019] EWCA Civ 872</ref>. There, the court was concerned with the lawfulness of the respondent&#8217;s policy on the detention of young people, which gave guidance on how to assess whether such a young person was under 18. At paragraph 63, Underhill LJ held that:-</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">&#8220;The correct approach in the circumstances of the present case is, straightforwardly, that the policy/guidance contained in paragraph 55.3.9.1 of the EIG and the relevant parts of &#8220;Assessing Age</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">&#8221;</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt"> will be unlawful, if but only if, the way that they are framed creates a real risk of a more than minimal number of children being detained. I should emphasise, however, that the policy should not be held to be unlawful only because there are liable, as in any system which necessarily depends on the exercise of subjective judgment, to be particular "aberrant" decisions &#8211; that is, individual mistakes or misjudgements made in the pursuit of a proper policy. The issue is whether the terms of the policy themselves create a risk which could be avoided if they were better formulated.&#8221;</span></p>

In </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">BF,</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> by contrast, the policy in question was concerned with the making of an evaluative assessment as to an individual&#8217;s age. No policy which seeks to guide the making of such an assessment can guarantee that incorrect decisions will never be made, unless the policy is framed in such a way as unduly to circumscribe, or even eliminate, its usefulness (e.g. by specifying that only those considered to be over the age of 50 should be regarded as adults in age-disputed cases).</span></p>

No policy designed to comply with the Article 2 procedural duty of taking &#8220;reasonable steps&#8221; to secure evidence, following a death in detention, can guarantee that potentially relevant evidence will always be secured and made available to the investigating body or bodies. Although the respondent&#8217;s responsibilities for immigration control cannot dilute what would otherwise be her Article 2 procedural obligations, they must nevertheless inform the tribunal or court&#8217;s assessment of what is reasonable in the context of the investigation of a death occurring in immigration detention. This point can be seen from the applications for interim relief made by Duncan Lewis Solicitors following OO&#8217;s death, where the claim that no one in detention in the relevant facilities could be removed was rejected by the Court of Appeal.</span></p>

She submits, however, that the respondent not only must identify the pool of material witnesses, secure their evidence, identity and whereabouts and provide all this to the responsible investigating authorities, but also that she must permit the coroner to reach a conclusion as to which witnesses are required and by what means their evidence should be provided. Until then, no removal of anyone in the pool is possible.

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">The actual implementation of these obligations may, of course, involve liaison with other relevant actors, such as the police, the PPO and the coroner. Depending on the circumstances, the views of the coroner may well need to be sought: for example, where the individual is the sole eyewitness to the death and their evidence is likely to be controversial. The rigidity of the model proposed by the applicant, however, goes far beyond what is reasonable. It would put an undue fetter on the ability of the respondent to discharge her statutory functions in the immigration field. We agree with Mr Thomann that it would be open to abuse by those opportunistically seeking to benefit from a death by prolonging their stay in the United Kingdom. There is no evidence that coroners would regard such a system as desirable or, indeed, practicable from their perspective. The letter from the Senior Coroner for Lincolnshire cannot be prayed in aid in this regard. On the contrary, he was at pains to recognise the respondent&#8217;s immigration functions and to emphasise he was not suggesting fettering them. Provided that the respondent&#8217;s policy mandates appropriate action to be taken to identify and secure the evidence, as described above, the respondent must be able to exercise her judgment in deciding what, in a particular case, constitutes a reasonable response, following a death in detention. As Mr Thomann pointed out, the respondent will still be susceptible to legal challenge in any individual case.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">The applicant made much of the fact that the coroner cannot compel the attendance of witnesses outside (in this case) England and Wales. Whilst the lack of compellability was, as we have seen, an important matter in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Edwards</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">, we agree with Mr Thomann that it cannot properly be suggested that guaranteeing the compellability of each and every potential witness regarding a death in detention is a </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">sine qua non</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> of an Article 2-compliant investigation. As Mr Thomann submits, that suggestion can be tested by reference to a witness who does not wish to remain in the United Kingdom. If a foreign visitor to the United Kingdom witnesses an unnatural fatality here and provides a written statement, but then understandably wishes to return home, it cannot be the case that Article 2 requires the United Kingdom to prevent them from doing so. We accept, of course, that the respondent bears a particular responsibility, where the death occurs in her immigration detention facility. Nevertheless, just as it would be unreasonable to prevent the visitor from leaving the jurisdiction of the part of the United Kingdom in which the death occurred, despite the possible consequences arising from the coroner&#8217;s inability to compel the visitor to attend the ensuing inquest, so the assessment of what is reasonable (that is to say, what Article 2 requires) needs to be made by reference to the fact that those in immigration detention are there in order that the respondent can remove them from the United Kingdom. Lack of compellability is, thus, a factor that must be considered, in the round, in deciding whether and, if so, how a person&#8217;s potential status a witness at an inquest impacts upon the respondent&#8217;s immigration functions, on the facts of a particular case. For example, if a person has expressed willingness to return to the United Kingdom, if requested to do so by the coroner, this factor may be such as, overall, to make it reasonable in terms of Article 2 for the respondent to remove them.</span></p>

She also points to the findings of the Supreme Court in relation to the Article 8 ECHR procedural duty in the case of </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Kiarie v Byndloss</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2017/42" uk:canonical="[2017] UKSC 42" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">[2017] UKSC 42</ref>; [2017] Imm AR 1299. We do not consider the comparison with </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Kiarie</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> to be apt. In that case, the individual facing removal was the actual appellant in an appeal involving his human rights. If outside the United Kingdom, he or she might face, amongst other things, difficulties in instructing, and being advised by, legal representatives; and in being the subject of any meaningful report by doctors or social workers. None of that is relevant here. So far as technology is concerned, matters have, of course, moved on since the point under consideration by the Supreme Court in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Kiarie</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">. This is true of all jurisdictions, including the coronial. The Lord Chief Justice was at pains to underscore the point at paragraph 198 of </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">FB</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">. Again, in the circumstances of a particular case, the respondent may need to pay particular attention to whether video evidence from abroad would be satisfactory. This may require liaising with the coroner before removal is effected. The general proposition that evidence given by video is inherently less satisfactory than evidence given by a person physically present in the courtroom, even if correct, is not, however, a justification for requiring coroners to play the fixed role urged on them by the applicant.</span></p>

As we have seen, at the time of OO&#8217;s death, the relevant policy was the DSO 08/2014, Version 2.0 of June 2016. There is no doubt that the policy contained in the June 2016 document created an unacceptable risk that the respondent would fail to comply with her Article 2 procedural duties of securing relevant evidence, following a death in immigration detention. The focus of the previous DSO was upon staff; and the evidence of staff. So far as detainees were concerned, the DSO dealt merely with their welfare needs when it also needed, crucially, to address the question of the evidence that detainees may have about the death. </span></p>

This is not a matter of failures occurring despite the existence of a reasonable policy. It is, rather, illustrative of the deficiencies of the policy. The notice delivered to detainees, set out at paragraph 8 above, followed the DSO in focusing upon their welfare needs without including a message urging detainees to come forward if they had relevant evidence to give. The previous DSO also lacked any exhortation to staff to be proactive in seeking such evidence. In the circumstances, it was entirely unsurprising that Mr Ullah, who occupied the room next to OO, was not interviewed; that his whereabouts became unknown. </span></p>

The new words in what is now paragraph 43 highlight the right of detainees to speak to the police and/or PPO investigator to make a witness statement in relation to any information they have which may be relevant to the deceased&#8217;s death. That is to be communicated in the notice given to detainees. Paragraph 60 requires staff to make available names of detainees who may be potential witnesses or have potentially relevant information. Paragraph 65 imposes on staff the obligation to comply with a PPO investigation, making available names of any individuals who may be potential witnesses or who have potentially relevant information. </span></p>

Whilst it would be inappropriate to expect centre staff to usurp the roles of the police and the PPO, as we have said at paragraph 64 above, they have a vital function to perform in identifying those detainees who, because of physical proximity to the deceased or other known associations, are likely to have relevant information, whether or not they have chosen to come forward of their own accord. In our view, the current policy fails to address this matter and is, therefore, not compliant with Article 2 in its procedural form. </span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">It will be recalled that a further revision to the DSO is proposed. Ms Hardy has stated that paragraph 60 will contain the words &#8220;It is important that we are able to identify any staff or detained individuals who may be potential witnesses or have potentially relevant information relating to the death and the checklist attached at Annex XX should be used for these purposes&#8221;. The checklist is, in our view, significant, in that it requires names of residents to be entered, together with reasons why they may have relevant evidence. Those reasons are, as we have seen, objectively couched. They require names to be given where staff are aware of a relevant reason, whether or not the detainee has come forward. Thus, for example, a detainee who is a &#8220;known associate&#8221; of the deceased must feature on the checklist, as must those who &#8220;responded to incident&#8221; or &#8220;entered scene&#8221;. </span></p>

Nor would it be appropriate for us to state categorically that the adoption of the words provided by Ms Hardy and the checklist will necessarily result in a legally sufficient policy document. It will be for the respondent to decide how, if at all, to react to what we have said. For the purposes of the present proceedings, we intend to make a declaration to the effect that the DSO in its August 2020 form is unlawful, in that it gives rise to a real risk of an Article 2 procedural breach because it does not direct relevant personnel actively to identify, and to take steps to secure the evidence of, those detainees whom there is reason to believe may have relevant information concerning the death of the person concerned. </span></p>

As we have seen, the Senior Coroner for Lincolnshire, in his letter of 27 August 2020 to the Secretary of State, raised as a particular point of concern that &#8220;two detainees were on the point of being physically deported in circumstances where the Home Office either was not aware, or chose to ignore the fact that these detainees were important witnesses required to give evidence at a forthcoming inquest hearing&#8221;.

Any policy needs to provide a process, whereby the relevant immigration official is made aware if a person scheduled for removal has been identified by centre staff and/or the respondent&#8217;s officers at an immigration detention facility as a person with potentially relevant information or evidence to give in respect of a death in custody in that facility. The official must then consider the likely importance of the evidence; the likely ability of the respondent to maintain contact with the individual, if removed; and the likelihood of the individual being able to return to the United Kingdom or give evidence by video-link from abroad, at the inquest. These are matters for the respondent&#8217;s officials who are tasked with the discharge of her immigration functions, rather than the centre staff. </span></p>
