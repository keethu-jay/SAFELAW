	      <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.25in">These are appeals against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Tax Chamber) (the &#8220;FTT&#8221;) released on 23 March 2020 (the &#8220;Decision&#8221;). The first appellant was previously named &#8220;Cape Industrial Services Limited&#8221; and referred to in the Decision as &#8220;CIS&#8221;, an abbreviation that we will also use. We refer to the second appellant as &#8220;Wiseman&#8221;.</p>

The closure notice for CIS related to its accounting period ended 31 December 2010 and, by denying capital allowances, made CIS liable to additional corporation tax of &#163;2,977,863. The closure notice for Wiseman related to its accounting period ended 31 March 2011 and resulted in an additional corporation tax liability of &#163;12,623,202.82.</p>

	      <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.25in">The depreciation in value of plant and machinery and other capital items does not give rise to a deductible expense for tax purposes. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CAA 2001</ref> seeks to reduce the impact of this rule by providing for capital allowances to be given, by way of a deduction against taxable profits, in respect of expenditure on, among other things, plant and machinery used for the purposes of a &#8220;qualifying activity&#8221;, which includes a trade. Allowances are generally given on a &#8220;pooled&#8221; basis, so a taxpayer incurring expenditure to acquire plant and machinery increases the pool of expenditure qualifying for allowances. Allowances are made as a percentage of the balance available in the pool, the pool being reduced by the amount of the allowances given (known as the reducing balance basis). A taxpayer selling plant and machinery that has qualified for allowances in any accounting period is required to bring the sale proceeds into account as a &#8220;disposal value&#8221;. Amounts brought into account as disposal value reduce the expenditure in the pool eligible for allowances in subsequent accounting periods or, if the disposal value exceeds the balance in the pool, create a balancing charge.</p>

	      <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.25in">The general rule, set out in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/11" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CAA 2001</ref>, is that expenditure on plant and machinery qualifies for capital allowances if: (i) the expenditure is &#8220;capital expenditure on the provision of plant and machinery&#8221;, (ii) it is incurred for the purposes of a qualifying activity, and (iii) the person incurring the expenditure owns the plant and machinery as a result of incurring it. Section 61 deals with &#8220;disposal events&#8221;, with the paradigm example of such an event occurring when a person &#8220;ceases to own&#8221; plant and machinery (s61(1)(a)). As Mr Peacock QC put it in his oral submissions, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/11" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref> and s61 are &#8220;book-ends&#8221; with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/11" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref> providing for capital allowances to begin to accrue when plant and machinery is purchased and s61 providing for future allowances to cease to accrue when that plant and machinery is disposed of (to the extent that disposal value is brought into account), as well as recapturing excessive allowances that have been given.</p>

	      <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.25in">Until 2006, &#8220;ownership&#8221; of plant and machinery was central to the entitlement to capital allowances. A taxpayer who incurred expenditure on plant and machinery would not (generally) be entitled to allowances unless the taxpayer owned the plant and machinery in question (see <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/11" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CAA 2001</ref>). Similarly, if the plant and machinery ceased to be owned, a disposal value would be brought into account in the pool, reducing the taxpayer&#8217;s future entitlement to allowances. </p>

	      <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.25in">One exception to the code&#8217;s focus on &#8220;ownership&#8221; was made for hire-purchase and similar contracts. Under such a contract, a taxpayer might be given the use of an item of plant and machinery in return for a stream of recurring payments, but only obtain &#8220;ownership&#8221; of the item, either automatically or by exercising an option, once all instalments have been paid. Legislation, now found in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/67" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 67" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s67</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CAA 2001</ref>, deems a taxpayer in this position to be the owner of the plant and machinery from inception of the hire-purchase contract, even though ownership would not be obtained until the end. In a similar vein to the position where the asset is owned by the taxpayer, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/67/4" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 67" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s67(4)</ref> of CAA 2001 provides for a deemed cessation of ownership if a person ceases to be entitled to the benefit of a hire-purchase contract, so that a disposal value can be brought in under s61.</p>

	      <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.25in">Until 2006, the general position was that a person <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">leasing</span> plant and machinery could not obtain capital allowances. Any allowances would benefit the person who owned the plant and machinery, namely the lessor. However, accounting practice had long recognised that certain leases of plant and machinery (&#8220;finance leases&#8221;), while taking the legal form of a lease of plant and machinery, were in substance loans in which the lessee had the risks and rewards of ownership of the machinery and raised finance from the lessor, with the machinery serving as the collateral or security for that loan. Consistent with that view of a finance lease, the lessee, and not the lessor, would recognise the machinery as an asset on its balance sheet.</p>

	      <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.25in">In 2006, amendments were made to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CAA 2001</ref> which recognised that a lessee of plant and machinery under a &#8220;long funding finance lease&#8221; (and certain operating leases that also performed a financing function) could obtain capital allowances on that plant and machinery even though the lessee was not the legal owner. A complicated code was needed to determine the amount on which allowances could be obtained, recognising that lessees typically pay a stream of recurring payments under the leases and so the legislation needed to identify a present value of that stream that attracted allowances. Very broadly, at times material to these appeals and before further legislative changes were made in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2011/11" uk:canonical="2011 c. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Finance Act 2011</ref>, the legislation determined that, for leases such as those relevant in these appeals, allowances would be available by reference to the present value of the &#8220;minimum lease payments&#8221;, defined in s70YE(1) of CAA 2001 as:</p>

Those arrangements were disclosed to HMRC under the rules applicable to tax avoidance schemes (known as &#8220;DOTAS&#8221;) and were allocated a &#8220;scheme reference number&#8221;. By the time of the hearing before us, all parties were agreed that there was no material difference between the ways in which both appellants implemented their transactions. Therefore, argument before us proceeded on the basis of a simplified example transaction, which focused only on the features relevant in these proceedings and which used hypothetical numbers. We will apply our own analysis to that example transaction.

While they did have the use of SGLJ&#8217;s money for the short period while each Lease was in place, taking into account the fees that they had to pay, they were incurring a &#8220;very high&#8221; annualised funding cost of between 15% and 30%.

The appellants gave up ownership of the assets (subject to the leaseback) with the attendant legal and commercial effects that entailed but they only did so to generate the desired allowances and, it appears, for the bare minimum of time considered necessary to achieve that result.

It follows that the sole battleground between the parties on Issue 1 is whether an application of the <span style="font-style:italic">Ramsay</span> approach means that the appellants did not cease to own the Assets when they sold them to SGLJ for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/61/1" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s61(1)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CAA 2001</ref>.</p>

The disposal value of &#163;100 arising on the appellants&#8217; analysis when the Assets are sold is matched by qualifying expenditure of &#163;100 when each appellant enters into the Lease. Moreover, it is common ground between the parties that, if the appellants are entitled to any allowances at all when they enter into their Lease, those allowances are to be based on qualifying expenditure of &#163;100.</p>

Both parties were agreed that these subsequent changes cannot inform the proper construction of the legislation as in force for the periods in which the appellants implemented their transactions. We do not, therefore, rely on the Finance Act 2011 changes as an aid to the construction of earlier legislation, but simply note that, in s33 of Finance Act 2011, Parliament legislated to prevent any amount that could reasonably be assumed to constitute qualifying expenditure when paid from being taken into account either (i) in the calculation of &#8220;QE&#8221;, the qualifying expenditure under a long funding finance lease, or (ii) in the calculation of &#8220;QA&#8221;.

This is because HMRC say that the reason that the &#163;95 could count as part of the qualifying expenditure at inception of the lease, and as part of QE on termination, is that it was guaranteed by a connected person, within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/70" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s70</ref>YE(1)(a) (read with <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/70" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s70</ref>C(4)). It would follow from this that, if HMRC were correct, then where there was a connected party guarantee allowances would be available under the long funding lease rules in respect of the present value of residual amounts, but allowances would not be so available if there was no such guarantee. Apart from lacking logic (as discussed further below), HMRC&#8217;s interpretation also ignores the reference to the lessee in the definition in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/70" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s70</ref>YE(1)(a) (&#8220;guaranteed by him&#8221;, that is the lessee).</p>

	    <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.25in">There are a number of real-world scenarios, not related at all to tax avoidance, where a person might transition from claiming allowances under the rules applicable to long funding finance leases to claiming allowances on the basis of being the outright owner of plant and machinery. At its simplest, a lessee of plant and machinery might purchase the equipment from its lessor for commercial reasons, either terminating the lease early or on expiry of the lease. In such circumstances, the scheme of the legislation suggests that there needs to be a &#8220;closing&#8221; figure under the long funding finance lease rules that helps to determine any disposal value under that regime, and an &#8220;opening&#8221; figure under the general rules applicable to outright owners of plant and machinery that enables allowances to be determined going forward. A fundamental difficulty with HMRC&#8217;s analysis is that, until the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2011/11" uk:canonical="2011 c. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Finance Act 2011</ref> changes to which we have referred, Parliament did not prescribe any link between these &#8220;closing&#8221; and &#8220;opening&#8221; values. HMRC&#8217;s submission that &#8220;QA&#8221; could not include items taken into account under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/11" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref> is a rationalisation based no doubt on what they consider to be the unwelcome effects of transactions of the kind effected by the appellants, but which has no obvious basis in the statutory language that Parliament has used.</p>

	    <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.25in">In the scenario set out in paragraph 52, if the purchase was made pursuant to a self-standing offer made during the currency of or on expiry of a long funding finance lease, rather than pursuant to a commitment previously entered into, then the expenditure incurred would count only towards the &#8220;opening&#8221; value under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/11" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref>, because it would not be a payment under a guarantee of any residual amount. There is no question of the treatment of this sum as qualifying expenditure under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/11" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref> giving rise to any step up in total allowances since no amount in respect of that sum would have been brought into account as qualifying expenditure under the long funding lease rules at the inception of the lease either (because it would not form part of commencement PVMLP), and it would also not be reflected in the calculation of disposal value because it would form part of neither QE nor QA in the &#8220;(QE &#8211; QA) + R&#8221; formula in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/70" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 70" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s70</ref>C.

Therefore, on HMRC&#8217;s case, a special approach to QA, which involves excluding from it sums that count as capital expenditure under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/11" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref> even where they have contributed to the definition of QE, is to be applied in the case of the purchase of equipment by a lessee from a lessor under a long funding finance lease on exercise of a put option, where the put option in question has been guaranteed by a person connected with the lessee. </p>

That, it seems to us, would be wholly irrational distinction which Parliament cannot be taken to have intended to draw. The specific inclusion of residual amounts in commencement PVMLP indicates that Parliament did intend to confer a right to allowances in respect of them, and we can see no justification for concluding that it only intended to do so where a guarantee from another entity was in place.</p>

That is a forward-looking exercise that raises the possibility of a taxpayer being credited with too much qualifying expenditure if payments actually made under the lease are lower than those taken into account in the determination of qualifying expenditure. For example, a lease might terminate early before all scheduled payments due under the lease have actually been made. A lessee might not actually make all payments due under the lease.

However, if such a payment is not actually made <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">by the </span>lessee <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">itself</span>, the payment does not fall within QA, with the result that the truing up mechanism we have outlined results in the allowances given up front being clawed back.

That said, the approach has a particular application in cases of tax avoidance. Not infrequently, tax avoidance schemes may seek to bring a transaction without any business or commercial purpose within the scope of a statutory provision intended to apply to a commercial transaction. Tax avoidance schemes may include transactions, or elements of composite transactions, which have no purpose other than tax avoidance. Where that is the case, the transactions in question will frequently be disregarded for tax purposes. However, any such disregard does not take place simply because the taxpayer&#8217;s purpose in effecting them is regarded as objectionable.

The transfer tax was normally chargeable on &#8220;disposals&#8221; of shares but, by the terms of legislation that was based on the &#8220;reorganisation&#8221; provisions used for the purposes of UK capital gains tax, an exchange of shares for &#8220;debentures&#8221; was treated as involving no &#8220;disposal&#8221;. The taxpayer sold shares in return for a short-dated debenture, redeemable just a few days after issue, and claimed to have avoided the Jamaican transfer tax successfully because there was no &#8220;disposal&#8221; on which the charge could bite. The Privy Council disagreed. It concluded that the relevant transaction for the purposes of the Jamaican legislation was a combination, comprising both the issue of the debenture and its redemption. Once that was appreciated, there was no exchange of shares for debentures (viewed in isolation) and so the planning failed. In reaching that conclusion, the Privy Council noted at [13] that:</p>

That argument hinges on the proposition that the appellants did not cease to own the Assets for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/61/1" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s61(1)</ref>(a) when they sold them to SGLJ. We agree with the appellants that this argument can only be investigated by considering the meaning and purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/61/1" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s61(1)</ref>(a).

	    <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.25in">Moreover, at [261], the FTT recorded its view that the appellants&#8217; arguments required the FTT to apply a &#8220;formalistic step by step analysis in assessing the tax effects of the transaction&#8221; and to &#8220;focus narrowly solely on the legal effects of the sale of ownership rights in respect of the assets and, correspondingly, the re-acquisition of those rights&#8221;. However, the appellants were not arguing for any such &#8220;formalistic&#8221; approach to the analysis of the <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">facts</span>. Their point was that, properly <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">construed</span>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/61/1" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s61(1)</ref>(a) provided for the appellants to &#8220;cease to own&#8221; the Assets once legal and beneficial ownership was lost. The FTT concluded at [264] to [266] that HMRC&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Ramsay</span> argument succeeded because of (i) the absence of any commercial purpose to the transactions, (ii) the fact that the appellants lost ownership of the Assets for just a few weeks, (iii) the fact that the appellants immediately on selling the Assets retained the right to use them under the Lease and (iv) the fact that exercise of the Put Option was effectively pre-ordained. There can be no objection to the FTT&#8217;s factual findings on points (i) to (iv).

Before doing so, we note something of an oddity in HMRC&#8217;s approach to their <span style="font-style:italic">Ramsay</span> argument. As we have noted in our high-level summary of the capital allowances code in paragraph 5 above, where a taxpayer brings into account a &#8220;disposal value&#8221; that operates to the detriment of the taxpayer in the sense that the taxpayer&#8217;s entitlement to capital allowances is reduced and it may even become subject to a balancing charge. Where the disposal value arises because plant and machinery is sold to another person, it is true that the other person may be entitled to claim allowances on the basis that the purchase price paid constitutes capital expenditure under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/11" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref>. However, that will not invariably be the case: the purchaser might not have sufficient profits to be able to use the allowances fully or may even be resident outside the UK. There is, therefore, something somewhat unusual about HMRC premising their <span style="font-style:italic">Ramsay</span> argument on a proposition that the concept of ceasing to own plant and machinery for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/61/1" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s61(1)</ref>(a) is narrower than it might otherwise appear to be. In his oral submissions on behalf of the appellants, Mr Peacock QC gave relatively little prominence to this point no doubt because he accepted that all statutory provisions, whether they benefit taxpayers or HMRC, are to be construed purposively. However, the oddity to which we refer does perhaps suggest that HMRC&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Ramsay</span> challenge is not most naturally brought by reference to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/61/1" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s61(1)</ref>(a).</p>

BMI argued that the plant and machinery nevertheless &#8220;belonged&#8221; to it for capital allowances purposes. It argued that it had paid for the plant and machinery, received rent from the local authorities for its use and that the leases with the local authorities gave it the right to require the plant and machinery to be returned on determination of the leases.

Moreover, the statement that the &#8220;belonging&#8221; condition should be &#8220;capable of a ready answer&#8221; points against HMRC&#8217;s argument that the existence or otherwise of a future &#8220;pre-ordained&#8221; plan for the appellants to re-acquire ownership of the Assets prevented them from ceasing to own them. On that interpretation, a taxpayer facing a disposal event under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/61/1" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s61(1)</ref>(a) could assert to HMRC that, in fact, no such disposal value should be brought into account because, even though legal and beneficial ownership had been lost, there was a pre-ordained plan for the taxpayer to reacquire ownership. If that were right, the focus of the enquiry would become whether the arrangement truly was pre-ordained, with further difficult and uncertain questions arising if the intention of one party or another to participate in the pre-ordained plan changed.</p>

	    <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.25in">However, we do not consider that these cases justify the outcome for which HMRC argue. First, they were concerned with different statutory provisions. In <span style="font-style:italic">Carreras</span>, the Privy Council reached its conclusion by reference to the purpose of the relevant Jamaican statute imposing transfer tax. That gave rise to very different purposive considerations from those arising under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/61/1" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s61(1)</ref>(a). In <span style="font-style:italic">Scottish Provident</span>, the House of Lords was considering the interpretation of the word &#8220;entitlement&#8221; whereas in this case we are concerned with the question of whether a person &#8220;ceases to own&#8221; plant and machinery in circumstances where other parties may be affected by the answer to that question, with a corresponding need for it to be &#8220;capable of a ready answer&#8221; as Lord Browne-Wilkinson put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Melluish</span>. In any event, the nature of the analysis in <span style="font-style:italic">Scottish Provident</span> was very different. In that case, the two cross options were both exercisable at the same points of time. Any gilts that Citibank sought to acquire on exercise of its option could immediately be taken away from it by the exercise of Scottish Provident&#8217;s option. The House of Lords held that, once commercially irrelevant contingencies were ignored, there was no point in time at which Citibank had an &#8220;entitlement&#8221; to the gilts. Our case is different. For a period of three or four weeks, the appellants did not have legal or beneficial ownership of the Assets, but SGLJ did. HMRC&#8217;s argument is that the sale of the Assets should not be treated as falling within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2001/2/section/61/1" uk:canonical="2001 c. 2 s. 61" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s61(1)</ref>(a) because a <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">later</span> sale back of those Assets on exercise of the Put Option was pre-ordained.

We reject that submission since the notional single contract did not &#8220;provide&#8221; that the appellants would necessarily re-acquire the Assets. Rather, it gave SGLJ an option to sell the Assets back to each appellant. The practical certainty that SGLJ would exercise that option came not from the notional single contract but was a product of SGLJ&#8217;s own intentions and motivations, as the FTT found at [257].</p>

We agree, but that does not dispose of the issue. The &#8220;shall&#8221; limb of the test is not concerned with whether the reacquisition is on performance of the notional single contract.

That demonstrates that the focus is on rights held by the user of the asset. Such a focus also makes sense in policy terms. The clear intention is to permit owners of assets, and those who have the ability to secure ownership, to claim allowances on capital expenditure they incur for that purpose. Moreover, it is consistent with the need for the legislation to define clearly who is, or is not, to be treated as an owner of an asset and entitled to claim capital allowances on it. On HMRC&#8217;s approach to the word &#8220;may&#8221;, it might be necessary on each day during the life of a hire purchase agreement to assess the prospects or possibility of a put option being exercised to check whether it can still be said that the put option &#8220;may&#8221; result in the user becoming an owner. If the user and the person hiring the asset have different perspectives on this issue, the provision could be unworkable with both the user and the hirer of the asset asserting that they are &#8220;owners&#8221;. Alternatively, it might mean that allowances could be claimed by an entity that has no real ability to secure ownership, rather like the taxpayer in <span style="font-style:italic">Melluish</span>. By contrast, a focus on rights conferred on the user gives rise to no such difficulties: for so long as the user itself has a contractual right to acquire the asset, or itself has the option to purchase the asset, there is no difficulty in determining who is to be treated as owner.</p>
