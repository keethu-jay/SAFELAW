The First-tier Tribunal found that the respondent had not given consideration to the best interests of the applicant&#8217;s child, therefore failing to discharge her duty under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2009/11/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 55</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2009/11" uk:canonical="2009 c. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2009 Act</ref> when making the decision under appeal.

The subsequent appeals were heard together by Judge Warner on 7 March 2013.  In a decision promulgated on 13 March 2013, Judge Warner allowed the appeals on the ground that the removal of the applicant and his family members from the United Kingdom would be unlawful for being incompatible with Article 8.</span></p>

His status affects the family unit as a whole.  Additionally it would be difficult for the child coming up to the end of his secondary education and how he will be treated for university fees.  </span></p>

He said this has to be read in conjunction with the discretionary leave provisions.  He also relied on the Chapter 8 Transitional Provisions which were in force in January 2012.  At paragraph 5.1 it states that an application submitted before 9 July 2012 and which was considered and refused against part 8 of the Immigration Rules and his subsequent appeal against the decision to refuse is successful, leave should be granted under the Rules of part 8 in force at the date of application.  Mr Sharma submitted that this provision gives weight to the applicant&#8217;s argument.  Further support, he said, can be found in the April 2015 Immigration Directorate Instructions at paragraph 3.1.1, which states &#8220;a person who meets the following criteria will remain subject to the Immigration Rules in force as at 8 July 2012 until settlement (the grant of indefinite leave to remain) even where the application is granted on or after 9 July 2012.&#8221;  </span></p>

There was correspondence between the applicant&#8217;s solicitors and the respondent.  The respondent withdrew her decision and it took the respondent two years to make a lawful decision.  Mr Sharma submitted that but for the delay, the application would have been considered by the respondent long before 2012.

The application was refused because the Secretary of State was not satisfied that Mr Wadhwa had provided material evidence of satisfactory reasons in support of his application, and drew attention to the fact that such private and family life as he had developed in this country had been developed whilst he was here unlawfully.  At [57] the Court of Appeal discussed the ambit of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2009/11/section/55" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 55</ref>.  At [70] it held that a striking feature of Mr Wadhwa&#8217;s case is that at no stage did he make a clear request to the Secretary of State for the grant of ILR.  In those circumstances it would be wrong to criticise the Secretary of State for granting DL in the belief that she was acceding to the only application made.  Consistently with the absence of any request for ILR, none of the material sent to the UKBA in support of the application pointed to any disadvantage associated with the grant of DL as opposed to ILR.  </span></p>

At [29] of Alladin&#8217;s case, Mr Gallagher, a civil servant with the Operational Policy and Rules Unit in the Home Office, made a witness statement in which he explained the approach to granting leave outside the Rules, namely discretionary leave, leave to remain and indefinite leave to remain.  DL was mostly frequently granted where there were grounds for a claim based on human rights.  In developing a system of DL the Secretary of State sought to manage progression to permanent settlement in a way that acknowledges the interests of the country as a whole.  In particular, she was concerned to ensure that those who had ignored or could not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules did not proceed immediately into the permanent residence category ahead of those who have to demonstrate their compliance, and without being able to review their circumstances later to determine whether the further grant of leave was still appropriate.</span></p>

It was only after a second period of DL that an application for ILR was considered.  The Secretary of State considered that this struck a fair balance between the rights of those who could not be removed for human rights reasons and the wider interests of society as a whole.  To grant immediate settlement on the basis of overstaying would be to trivialise the requirement to use the lawful routes into the UK and undermine the Secretary of State&#8217;s ability to manage migration in a manner which the government considers to be in the interests of society as a whole.  Mr Malik submitted that Mr Gallagher&#8217;s evidence was accepted as rational and endorsed by the Court of Appeal who said at [59] that there can be no doubt that the Secretary of State is entitled in principle to adopt a staged approach to settlement.  Even where children are the applicants, it does not follow that the Secretary of State is bound, on a first application, to grant ILR.  The considerations outlined in the evidence of Mr Gallagher amount to factors which are worthy of consideration, and deserve to be placed in the balance after the best interests and welfare of the children have been considered.  It follows that an applicant who wishes to persuade the Secretary of State to grant her leave to remain for a longer period than that provided for by the state&#8217;s settlement policy has to do more than point to the fact that she is a child.  </span></p>

He said this was about the seven year concession policy which was withdrawn by the Secretary of State and therefore the applicant was not granted ILR.  The applicant argued that it was unfair not to be granted ILR.  The applicant argued that the withdrawal of the policy was unlawful because it was made without any prior notice, consultation or invitation to make representations.  The Court of Appeal at [42] held that the concept of legitimate expectation is normally otiose in cases where there has been no representation, by words or conduct by the public authority in question to the claimant seeking to rely on it.  It was said in the judgment that the Secretary of State was entitled to take the view that the policy was inimical to her immigration policy.  A Minister is entitled to review, to change and to revoke his policy whenever he considers it to be in the public interest to do so.  Thus he would reject any suggestion that the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision to withdraw the policy was irrational.  Nor did she fail to take into account the interests of the children of those seeking to remain here: their interests, as well as those of their parents, are adequately addressed by the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights, and in particular Article 8.  Relying on this judgment Mr Malik submitted that the Secretary of State was entitled to grant 30 months&#8217; discretionary leave to the applicants after the policy came into force.</span></p>

Mr Rahman entered the UK under leave he obtained by deception.  He failed to seek to regularise his family&#8217;s immigration status after the expiration of his leave.  They were here unlawfully.

The Supreme Court held that in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Rashid</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> the sloppiness of procedures in the Home Office resulted in the appellant being unfairly denied refugee status when he applied for it; but refugee status is not bound to endure forever.  By the time that his case reached the Court of Appeal the source of persecution in Iraq had been overthrown, and the effect of the court&#8217;s decision was to give him a right which he did not need for his personal protection.  Because the </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Rashid</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> exception to </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Ravichandran</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> lacks a satisfactory principle, it is also impossible to state its scope with any degree of clarity.

The question of whether the appellant qualifies for asylum status is not a question of discretion.  It is one which must be decided on the evidence before the Tribunal or court, and there is no legal justification for abridging that question with the presumption that the appellant is credible arising from a failure of the respondent properly to discharge her obligation in relation to family tracing.  Discretionary leave by definition involves a discretion, but it is a discretion which belongs to the respondent and not to the court.</span></p>

He did not make an application for indefinite leave to remain.  He made an application for discretionary leave to remain.

Floyd LJ said there could be no doubt in his judgment that the Secretary of State is entitled in principle to adopt a staged approach to settlement.  Even where children are the applicants, it does not follow that the Secretary of State is bound, on a first application, to grant ILR.  He went on to say that an applicant who wishes to persuade the Secretary of State to grant her leave for a period longer than that provided for by the staged settlement policy has to do more than point to the fact that she is a child.  He went on to say that a striking feature of Mr Wadhwa&#8217;s case is that at no stage did he make a clear request to the Secretary of State for the grant of ILR.  In those circumstances it would be wrong to criticise the Secretary of State for granting DLR in the belief that she was acceding to the only application made.  Consistently with the absence of any request for ILR, none of the material sent to the UKBA in support of the application pointed to any disadvantage associated with a grant of DLR as opposed to ILR.  </span></p>

By contrast, the children&#8217;s best interests&#8217; guidance requires caseworkers to give case-specific consideration to the welfare of any child concerned when deciding whether to grant a longer period of LTR, or ILR to the child&#8217;s parent.  The flaw in the previous policy has been recognised and addressed in an appropriate manner.

Mr Sharma argued that the additional four years for a minor is significant and that a potential prejudice has been caused to the applicant. The potential prejudice was in respect of the confusion that might be caused to the applicant child in respect of university fees.  I find that to be a very weak point.  The applicant is 10 years old. There was no evidence of any immediate prejudice to him in the grant of 30 months&#8217; DLR.
