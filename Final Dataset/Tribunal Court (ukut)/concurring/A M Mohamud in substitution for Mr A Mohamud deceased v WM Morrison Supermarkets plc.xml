	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Vicarious liability in tort requires, first, a relationship between the defendant and the wrongdoer, and secondly, a connection between that relationship and the wrongdoer&#8217;s act or default, such as to make it just that the defendant should be held legally responsible to the claimant for the consequences of the wrongdoer&#8217;s conduct. In this case the wrongdoer was employed by the defendant, and so there is no issue about the first requirement. The issue in the appeal is whether there was sufficient connection between the wrongdoer&#8217;s employment and his conduct towards the claimant to make the defendant legally responsible. By contrast, the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Cox v Ministry of Justice </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2016/10" uk:canonical="[2016] UKSC 10" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] UKSC 10</ref>, which was heard by the same division of the court at the same time, is concerned with the first requirement. The judgments are separate because the claims and issues are separate, but they are intended to be complementary to each other in their legal analysis. In preparing this judgment I have had the benefit of Lord Reed&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Cox</span>, and I agree fully with his reasoning and conclusion.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The question in this appeal concerns an employer&#8217;s vicarious liability in tort for an assault carried out by an employee. It is a subject which has troubled the courts on numerous occasions and the case law is not entirely consistent. In addressing the issues which it raises, it will be necessary to examine how the law in this area has developed, what stage it has reached and whether it is in need of significant change.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In this case the victim was a customer. I will call him the claimant although he sadly died from an illness unrelated to his claim before his appeal was heard by this court. The respondent company is a well known operator of a chain of supermarkets. It has premises in Small Heath, Birmingham, which include a petrol station. The petrol station has a kiosk with the usual display of goods and a counter where customers pay for their purchases. One of the company&#8217;s employees was Mr Amjid Khan. His job was to see that the petrol pumps and the kiosk were kept in good running order and to serve customers.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The claimant was of Somali origin. On the morning of 15 March 2008 he was on his way to take part with other members of his community in an event in London. While he was at the petrol station he decided to inquire whether it would be possible to print some documents from a USB stick which he was carrying.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The trial judge, Mr Recorder Khangure QC, accepted in full the claimant&#8217;s account of what followed. The claimant went into the kiosk and explained to the staff what he wanted. There were two or three staff present. Mr Khan, who was behind the counter, replied by saying &#8220;We don&#8217;t do such shit&#8221;. The claimant protested at being spoken to in that manner. Using foul, racist and threatening language, Mr Khan ordered the claimant to leave. The claimant walked out of the kiosk and returned to his car by the air pump. He was followed by Mr Khan. The claimant got into his car and switched on the engine, but before he could drive off Mr Khan opened the front passenger door and told him in threatening words never to come back. The claimant told Mr Khan to get out of the car and shut the passenger door. Instead, Mr Khan punched the claimant on his left temple, causing him pain and shock. The claimant switched off the engine and got out in order to walk round and close the passenger door. At this point Mr Khan again punched him in the head, knocked him to the floor and subjected him to a serious attack, involving punches and kicks, while the claimant lay curled up on the petrol station forecourt, trying to protect his head from the blows. In carrying out the attack Mr Khan ignored instructions from his supervisor, who came on the scene at some stage and tried to stop Mr Khan from behaving as he did. The judge concluded that the reasons for Mr Khan&#8217;s behaviour were a matter of speculation. The claimant himself had said and done nothing which could be considered abusive or aggressive.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In a detailed and impressive judgment, the judge reviewed the principal authorities. He expressed great sympathy for the claimant but concluded that the company was not vicariously liable for Mr Khan&#8217;s unprovoked assault. His principal reason was that although Mr Khan&#8217;s job involved some interaction with customers and members of the public who attended the kiosk, it involved nothing more than serving and helping them. There was not a sufficiently close connection between what he was employed to do and his tortious conduct for his employer to be held vicariously liable, applying the &#8220;close connection&#8221; test laid down in <span style="font-style:italic">Lister v Hesley Hall Ltd</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2001/22" uk:canonical="[2001] UKHL 22" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] UKHL 22</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 1 AC 215" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 1 AC 215</ref> and followed in later cases including <span style="font-style:italic">Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd v Salaam</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukhl/2002/48" uk:canonical="[2002] UKHL 48" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] UKHL 48</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2003] 2 AC 366" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2003">[2003] 2 AC 366</ref>. A further reason given by the judge was that Mr Khan made a positive decision to come out from behind the counter and follow the claimant out of the kiosk in contravention of instructions given to him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Court of Appeal (Arden, Treacy and Christopher Clarke LJJ) upheld the judge&#8217;s decision that the claim against the company failed the &#8220;close connection&#8221; test. The main points made in the judgments were that Mr Khan&#8217;s duties were circumscribed. He was not given duties involving a clear possibility of confrontation or placed in a situation where an outbreak of violence was likely. The fact that his employment involved interaction with customers was not enough to make his employers liable for his use of violence towards the claimant.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Christopher Clarke LJ added that if the question had been simply whether it would be fair and just for the company to be required to compensate the claimant for his injuries from the assault, there would be strong grounds for saying that it should. The assault arose out of an interchange which began when the claimant asked to be supplied with a service which he thought the company could provide. Mr Khan, whose job it was to deal with such a request, followed up his refusal with an apparently motiveless attack on the customer, who was in no way at fault. The customer was entitled to expect a polite response. Instead he was struck on the head and kicked when on the ground. In those circumstances it could be said that the employer could fairly be expected to bear the cost of compensation, rather than that the victim should be left without any civil remedy except against an assailant who was unlikely to be able to pay full compensation. However, he concluded that this was not the legal test, and that the fact that Mr Khan&#8217;s job involved interaction with the public did not provide the degree of connection between his employment and the assault which was necessary for the employer to be held vicariously liable. Christopher Clarke LJ said that he was attracted for a time by the proposition that the assault could be looked at as a perverse execution of Mr Khan&#8217;s duty to engage with customers, but he considered that such an approach parted company with reality.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In this court the claimant&#8217;s primary argument was that the time has come for a new test of vicarious liability. In place of the &#8220;close connection&#8221; test the courts should apply a broader test of &#8220;representative capacity&#8221;. In the case of a tort committed by an employee, the decisive question should be whether a reasonable observer would consider the employee to be acting in the capacity of a representative of the employer at the time of committing the tort. A company should be liable for the acts of its human embodiment. In the present case, Mr Khan was the company&#8217;s employed representative in dealing with a customer. What mattered was not just the closeness of the connection between his duties to his employer and his tortious conduct, but the setting which the employer had created. The employer created the setting by putting the employee into contact and close physical proximity with the claimant. Alternatively, it was argued that the claimant should in any event have succeeded because he was a lawful visitor to the premises and Mr Khan was acting within the field of activities assigned to him in dealing with the claimant.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The development of the doctrine of vicarious liability can be traced to a number of factors; in part to legal theories, of which there have been several; in part to changes in the structure and size of economic and other (eg charitable) enterprises; and in part to changes in social attitudes and the courts&#8217; sense of justice and fairness, particularly when faced with new problems such as cases of sexual abuse of children by people in a position of authority.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">According to Holdsworth&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">A History of English Law</span> (1908) (vol 3, pp 383-387) in medieval times the general principle was that a master was only liable at civil law for misdeeds of his servants if done by his command and consent. &#8220;It would be against all reason&#8221;, said counsel in the reign of Henry IV, &#8220;to impute blame or default to a man, when he has none in him, for the carelessness of his servants cannot be said to be his act&#8221; (YB 2 Hy IV Pasch pl 5). But there were some exceptions, which today would be classed as instances of non-delegable duty. Liability for damage by fire was an example. The law imposed on house holders a duty to keep their fires from damaging their neighbours. If a fire was caused by a servant or guest, and it damaged a neighbour&#8217;s house, the owner was liable. He could escape liability only by showing that the fire originated from the act of a stranger (YB 2 Hy IV Pasch pl 6).</p>

Holt CJ was particularly influential in this development.

Eyre J held that there was no difference between a land carrier and a water carrier, and therefore the owners were under a special liability as carriers for the acts of their servants; but Holt CJ rested his judgment on the broad principle that &#8220;whoever employs another is answerable for him, and undertakes for his care to all that make use of him&#8221;.

The majority of the judges held that the plaintiff had a cause of action under the medieval rule about liability for fire; but Holt CJ doubted whether that rule applied to fires other than in houses, and he based liability (according to the report in Comb.) on the broader ground that &#8220;if my servant doth anything prejudicial to another, it shall bind me, when it may be presumed that he acts by my authority, being about my business&#8221;.</p>

Sometimes it was put on the ground that the servant had an implied authority so to act - which again is clearly not true. Sometimes it was grounded on the fiction that the wrong of the servant is the wrong of the master, from which the conclusion was drawn that the master must be liable because no man shall be allowed to make any advantage of his own wrong; and sometimes on the ground that the master who chooses a careless servant is liable for making a careless choice. Blackstone gives all these reasons for this principle. In addition, he deals with the totally different case where a master has actually authorised the commission of a tort; and cites most of the mediaeval cases of vicarious liability with the special reasons for each of them. It is not surprising that he should take refuge in the maxim &#8216;qui facit per alium facit per se&#8217; or that others should have used in a similar way the maxim &#8216;respondeat superior&#8217;.

The claimant was struck in the eye by a piece of glass thrown by the barman who was on duty, and there would be something wrong with the law if he was not entitled to compensation from the company which employed the barman. A barman needs to be capable of acting with restraint under provocation, for the safety of other customers, and if the proprietor engaged someone who was incapable of doing so and who injured an innocent customer, it would be wrong for the customer to be left with his only remedy against the barman. But to rationalise the result by describing the barman&#8217;s loss of temper and act of retaliation as a mode, but improper mode, of keeping order and avoiding altercation is an unnatural use of words.</p>

In a broader sense it occurred in the course of her employment. She was employed by the hotel proprietor to serve customers. She was approached in that capacity by a customer, and ordinary members of the public would surely expect the company who employed her to serve customers to have some responsibility for her conduct towards them. And it surely cannot be right that the measure of the company&#8217;s responsibility should depend on whether she was the head barmaid or an assistant.

When he returned with the police officer it was for the purpose of making a personal complaint about the attendant.

The judge was right to dismiss the customer&#8217;s claim against the petrol company.

The Board rejected the argument that his job could be described as &#8220;managing the bus&#8221; and that his conduct arose out of his power and duty to do so. The case illustrates again the awkwardness of the Salmond formula when applied to such situations. Looked at more broadly, the bus company selected the conductor for employment and put him in charge of the passenger area of the bus. He abused the position of authority which his employment gave him. Because he was throwing his weight around as the conductor, the plaintiff objected. Because the conductor objected to what he appeared to regard as interference with the exercise of his authority, he struck the plaintiff in the face. (The trial judge summarised it by saying that &#8220;He was in effect telling the plaintiff by his act not to interfere with him in his due performance of his duties&#8221;: p 1084.)

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;The question is not to be answered merely by applying the test whether the act in itself is one which the servant was authorised or ordered or forbidden to do. The employer has to shoulder responsibility on a wider basis; and he may, and often does, become responsible to third parties for acts which he has expressly or impliedly forbidden the servant to do. &#8230; It remains necessary to the master&#8217;s responsibility that the servant&#8217;s act be one done within the sphere of his service or the scope of his employment, but it may have this character although it consists in doing something which is the very opposite of what the servant has been intended or ordered to do, and which he does for his own private ends. An honest master does not employ or authorise his servant to commit crimes of dishonesty towards third parties; but nevertheless he may incur liability for a crime of dishonesty committed by the servant if it was committed by him within the field of activities which the employment assigned to him, and that although the crime was committed by the servant solely in pursuance of his own private advantage.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;In words which have frequently been quoted both in the courts and in the universities, <span style="font-style:italic">Salmond on Torts</span>, 16th ed (1973), p 462, refers to the basis of vicarious liability for accidental damage as being one of public policy. That view is supported by quotations (dated no doubt, but still full of life) of a dictum of Lord Brougham and of another, 100 years or more earlier, of Sir John Holt. That it is &#8220;socially convenient and rough justice&#8221; to make an employer liable for the torts of his servant in the cases to which the principle applies, was recognised in <span style="font-style:italic">Limpus v</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">London General Omnibus Co</span>, 1 H &amp; C 526; see the judgment of Willes J at p 539. I think it important to realise that the principle of vicarious liability is one of public policy. It is not a principle which derives from a critical or refined consideration of other concepts in the common law, for example, the concept of trespass or indeed the concept of agency. No doubt in particular cases it may be relevant to consider whether a particular plaintiff was or was not a trespasser. Similarly, when, as I shall indicate, it is important that one should determine the course of employment of the servant, the law of agency may have some marginal relevance. But basically, as I understand it, the employer is made vicariously liable for the tort of his employee not because the plaintiff is an invitee, nor because of the authority possessed by the servant, but because it is a case in which the employer, having put matters into motion, should be liable if the motion which he has originated leads to damage to another. What is the approach which the cases identify as the correct approach in order to determine this question of public policy? First, &#8230; one looks to see whether the servant has committed a tort upon the plaintiff &#8230; The next question &#8230; is whether the employer should shoulder the liability for compensating the person injured by the tort &#8230; [I]t does appear to me to be clear, since the decision of <span style="font-style:italic">Limpus v London General Omnibus Co</span>, 1 H &amp; C 526, that that question has to be answered by directing attention to what the servant was employed to do when he committed the tort that has caused damage to the plaintiff. The servant was, of course, employed at the time of the accident to do a whole number of operations. He was certainly not employed to give the boy a lift, and if one confines one&#8217;s analysis of the facts to the incident of injury to the plaintiff, then no doubt one would say that carrying the boy on the float - giving him a lift - was not in the course of the servant&#8217;s employment. But in <span style="font-style:italic">Ilkiw v Samuels</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1963] 1 WLR 991" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1963">[1963] 1 WLR 991</ref> Diplock LJ indicated that the proper approach to the nature of the servant&#8217;s employment is a broad one. He says, at p 1004: &#8216;As each of these nouns implies&#8217; - he is referring to the nouns used to describe course of employment, sphere, scope and so forth - &#8216;the matter must be looked at broadly, not dissecting the servant&#8217;s task into its component activities - such as driving, loading, sheeting and the like - by asking: what was the job on which he was engaged for his employer? and answering that question as a jury would&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In <span style="font-style:italic">Lister</span> the House of Lords was faced with the problem of the application of the doctrine of vicarious liability to the warden of a school boarding house who sexually abused the children in his care. The Salmond formula was stretched to breaking point. Even on its most elastic interpretation, the sexual abuse of the children could not be described as a mode, albeit an improper mode, of caring for them. Drawing on Scarman LJ&#8217;s approach, Lord Steyn (with whom Lords Hutton and Hobhouse agreed) spoke of the pitfalls of terminology and said that it was not necessary to ask whether the acts of sexual abuse were modes of doing authorised acts. He posed the broad question whether the warden&#8217;s torts was so closely connected with his employment that it would be just to hold the employers liable. He concluded that the employers were vicariously liable because they undertook the care of the children through the warden and he abused them. There was therefore a close connection between his employment and his tortious acts. To similar effect, Lord Clyde said that the warden had a general duty to look after the children, and the fact that he abused them did not sever the connection with his employment; his acts had to be seen in the context that he was entrusted with responsibility for their care, and it was right that his employers should be liable for the way in which he behaved towards them as warden of the house.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Secondly, the court must decide whether there was sufficient connection between the position in which he was employed and his wrongful conduct to make it right for the employer to be held liable under the principle of social justice which goes back to Holt. To try to measure the closeness of connection, as it were, on a scale of 1 to 10, would be a forlorn exercise and, what is more, it would miss the point. The cases in which the necessary connection has been found for Holt&#8217;s principle to be applied are cases in which the employee used or misused the position entrusted to him in a way which injured the third party. <span style="font-style:italic">Lloyd v Grace, Smith &amp; Co</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Peterson</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Lister</span> were all cases in which the employee misused his position in a way which injured the claimant, and that is the reason why it was just that the employer who selected him and put him in that position should be held responsible. By contrast, in <span style="font-style:italic">Warren v Henlys</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">Ltd</span> any misbehaviour by the petrol pump attendant, qua petrol pump attendant, was past history by the time that he assaulted the claimant.

What happened thereafter was an unbroken sequence of events. It was argued by the respondent and accepted by the judge that there ceased to be any significant connection between Mr Khan&#8217;s employment and his behaviour towards the claimant when he came out from behind the counter and followed the claimant onto the forecourt. I disagree for two reasons. First, I do not consider that it is right to regard him as having metaphorically taken off his uniform the moment he stepped from behind the counter. He was following up on what he had said to the claimant. It was a seamless episode. Secondly, when Mr Khan followed the claimant back to his car and opened the front passenger door, he again told the claimant in threatening words that he was never to come back to the petrol station. This was not something personal between them; it was an order to keep away from his employer&#8217;s premises, which he reinforced by violence. In giving such an order he was purporting to act about his employer&#8217;s business. It was a gross abuse of his position, but it was in connection with the business in which he was employed to serve customers. His employers entrusted him with that position and it is just that as between them and the claimant, they should be held responsible for their employee&#8217;s abuse of it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The close connection test has now been repeatedly applied by our courts for some 13 years. In my view, it should only be abrogated or refined if a demonstrably better test can be devised. Far from being demonstrably better, the proposed new test is hopelessly vague. What does &#8220;representative capacity&#8221; mean in this context? And by what criteria is the court to determine the circumstances in which the reasonable observer would consider the employee to be acting in a representative capacity? I do not see how this test is more precise than the close connection test or how it better reflects modern views of justice. The attraction of the close connection test is that it is firmly rooted in justice. It asks whether the employee&#8217;s tort is so closely connected with his employment as to make it just to hold the employer liable.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is true that the test is imprecise. But this is an area of the law in which, as Lord Nicholls said, imprecision is inevitable. To search for certainty and precision in vicarious liability is to undertake a quest for a chimaera. Many aspects of the law of torts are inherently imprecise. For example, the imprecise concepts of fairness, justice and reasonableness are central to the law of negligence. The test for the existence of a duty of care is whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose such a duty. The test for remoteness of loss is one of reasonable foreseeability. Questions such as whether to impose a duty of care and whether loss is recoverable are not always easy to answer because they are imprecise. But these tests are now well established in our law. To adopt the words of Lord Nicholls, the court has to make an evaluative judgment in each case having regard to all the circumstances and having regard to the assistance provided by previous decisions on the facts of other cases.</p>

It is true that there have been developments in the law as to the type of <span style="font-style:italic">relationship</span> that has to exist between an individual and a defendant for vicarious liability to be imposed on the defendant in respect of a tort committed by that individual. These developments have been a response to changes in the legal relationships between enterprises and members of their workforces and the increasing complexity and sophistication of the organisation of enterprises in the modern world. A good example is provided by the facts of the <span style="font-style:italic">Catholic Child Welfare Society</span> case itself.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">But there is no need for the law governing the <span style="font-style:italic">circumstances</span> in which an employer should be held vicariously liable for a tort committed by his employee to be on the move. There have been no changes in societal conditions which require such a development. The changes in the case law relating to the definition of the circumstances in which an employer is vicariously liable for the tort of his employee have not been made in response to changing social conditions. Rather they have been prompted by the aim of producing a fairer and more workable test. Unsurprisingly, this basic aim has remained constant. The Salmond test defined a wrongful act by a servant in the course of his employment as &#8220;either (a) a wrongful act authorised by the master or (b) a wrongful and unauthorised <span style="font-style:italic">mode</span> of doing some act authorised by the master&#8221;: Salmond, Law of Torts, 1st ed (1907), p 83; and Salmond &amp; Heuston on the Law of Torts, 21st ed (1996), p 443. As Lord Steyn said in <span style="font-style:italic">Lister</span> at para 20, this was &#8220;simply a practical test serving as a dividing line between cases where it is or is not <span style="font-style:italic">just</span> to impose vicarious liability&#8221; (emphasis added). The importance of <span style="font-style:italic">Lister</span> (and the Canadian case of <span style="font-style:italic">Bazley v Curry</span>(1999) 174 DLR (4th) 45 whose reasoning it adopted) is that it recognised the difficulty created by the second limb of the Salmond test. This was not effective for determining the circumstances in which it was just to hold an employer vicariously liable for committing an act not authorised by the employer. The close connection test was introduced in order to remedy this shortcoming. This improvement was achieved by the simple expedient of explicitly incorporating the concept of justice into the close connection test. The new test was, therefore, by definition more effective than the Salmond test for determining the circumstances in which it is just to hold an employer vicariously liable for the unauthorised acts of his employee. It is difficult to see how the close connection test might be further refined. It is sufficient to say that no satisfactory refinement of the test has been suggested in the present case.</p>
