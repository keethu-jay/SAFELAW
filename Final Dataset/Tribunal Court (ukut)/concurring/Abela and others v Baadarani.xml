	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an appeal against an order of the Court of Appeal (Arden, Longmore and McFarlane LJJ) made on 15 December 2011 in which they set aside the orders of a number of judges and, in particular, an order of Sir Edward Evans-Lombe (&#8220;the judge&#8221;) made on 28 January 2011 in which he declared, pursuant to CPR 6.37(5)(b) and/or 6.15(2), that the steps taken on 22 October 2009 to bring the claim form to the attention of the respondent amounted to good service of the claim form. The Court of Appeal held that the judge should not have made that declaration, that various extensions of the validity of the claim form for service should not have been granted, that the respondent had not been properly served with the claim form and that it followed that the claim must be dismissed. The principal issue in this appeal is whether the Court of Appeal was correct to hold that the judge should not have declared that the events of 22 October 2009 amounted to good service of the claim form.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As stated in the agreed statement of facts and issues, the underlying claim is for damages for fraud in connection with a contract for the purchase of shares in an Italian company called Gama SpA (&#8220;Gama&#8221;), made in March 2002, between the third appellant, as purchaser, and the respondent and Cicines Holdings Ltd (&#8220;Cicines&#8221;), as vendors, for a total consideration of US$14m. The contract expressly provided that it was governed by English law and contained a non-exclusive English jurisdiction clause. The appellants claim that the shares were worthless or worth far less than the amount paid for them. The claim alleges that the fraud involved corruption on the part of a Mr Haan, a lawyer for the appellants, who acted for them in connection with the sale and is said also to have acted secretly for the respondent without the appellants&#8217; knowledge.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The claim form in this action was issued on 30 April 2009, following the settlement of an action (&#8220;the Haan action&#8221;) by the appellants against Mr Haan and a firm of solicitors (&#8220;Hammonds&#8221;) who were said to be vicariously liable for the torts of Mr Haan, in order to recover such part of the moneys paid under the contract as were not recovered in that action. The background facts are set out in some detail by the judge at paras 2 to 12 of his judgment of 28 January 2011, <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2011/116" uk:canonical="[2011] EWHC 116 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] EWHC 116 (Ch)</ref>. It is not necessary to set them out here, save to note that the action against Mr Haan and Hammonds came to trial on 11 March 2009 and was settled after eight days by a payment by the defendants in that action to the appellants of a sum which included costs. The claims in this action mirror those in the Haan action, although, if this action were to succeed, credit would presumably have to be given for sums recovered in the Haan action.</p>

They are summarised by the judge at para 19 of his judgment. The claims were brought against both the respondent and Cicines, but Cicines is not a party to this appeal.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows from the fact that the claim form was issued on 30 April 2009 that its validity for service out of the jurisdiction would expire after six months, on 29 October 2009. The appellants took no steps for some three and a half months until they instructed counsel to settle the particulars of claim in mid-August 2009. The particulars of claim were signed on 9 September 2009 and on 14 September 2009 an application for permission to serve the proceedings on the respondent outside the jurisdiction was made to Morgan J, without notice to the respondent. Both the particulars of claim and a detailed skeleton argument were put before the court. Morgan J was satisfied that there was a good arguable case for service out of the jurisdiction and for the extension of the validity of the claim form. By an order made on 14 September 2009, he gave permission under CPR 6.36 and 6.37 to serve the claim form and all other documents upon the respondent at an address at Farid Trad Street in Beirut in Lebanon (&#8220;the Farid Trad Street address&#8221;). He extended the time for serving the claim form from 29 October 2009 until 31 December 2009 and, to the extent required, gave permission to serve the claim form and documents by alternative means, namely by personal service of an untranslated copy of all the documents at the Farid Trad Street address.</p>

	  <num style="font-size:13pt">7.</num>
	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence before Morgan J comprised the first and second witness statements of Mr Mascarenhas of the appellants&#8217; solicitors and the first witness statement of the appellants' Lebanese lawyer, Mr Houssami. The evidence in support of the application included the following. The address in the claim form was in fact that of the respondent&#8217;s lawyer in Beirut. The respondent&#8217;s home address was believed to be the Farid Trad Street address, which was the appropriate address for service if he was to be served personally. That belief was based on what Mr Houssami had been told by individuals not identified in his witness statement and, more importantly, on the fact that he had previously effected service of legal proceedings there in late 2006 or early 2007 by leaving the documents with the respondent&#8217;s wife. Lebanon was not a party to any bilateral convention on service of judicial documents and, in particular, the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters (1965) (Cmnd 3986) (the &#8220;Hague Service Convention&#8221;) did not apply. Service of originating process through the judicial authorities or the British Consulate would be likely to take several months.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellants&#8217; evidence is that Mr Houssami used a notary to seek to serve the respondent by causing a service agent or clerk to attend at the Farid Trad Street address over a period of four consecutive days between 7 am and 4 pm, which were official working hours. The respondent could not be located at that address. The respondent denies that he lived there. However, on 22 October 2009, an untranslated copy of the claim form, which was in English, together with other relevant documents were delivered to the offices of Mr Azoury, who was the respondent&#8217;s Lebanese lawyer in Beirut. This was not the method of service authorised by the order of Morgan J, although on the respondent's application to set aside the various orders of the court, including the order of Morgan J, which came before the judge, the appellants contended that it amounted to good service on the respondent under Lebanese law. However, the Court of Appeal resolved this issue against the appellants, and there is no appeal against that decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellants continued to try to effect service through diplomatic channels at the Farid Trad Street address. They also obtained Arabic translations of the documents for service and a request for service out was delivered to the Foreign Process Section of the High Court on 19 November 2009 together with certified translations. There were some delays and, shortly before a hearing before Sales J on 16 December 2009, the appellants' solicitors were told by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that service through diplomatic channels in Lebanon might take a further three months from receipt of the documents.</p>

The use of diplomatic channels caused further delays. Under cover of a letter dated 11 February 2010, Mr Azoury communicated with the appellants' solicitors and returned the documents received by him on 22 October 2009. In the letter he noted that the address for service in the order of 14 September 2009, namely the Farid Trad Street address, was not that of the respondent, who had not to his knowledge ever lived there or had any connection with it. He further said that he had never had instructions to accept service of documents other than in connection with the Lebanese proceedings (referred to in para 15 below) and that the respondent had confirmed that that was the case. He gave no indication where the respondent could be served.</p>

If that was not accepted, they asked Mr Azoury to provide them with the respondent&#8217;s usual address and to agree a date and time for service on the respondent. Mr Azoury replied that the general power of attorney could only be used to authorise him to represent the respondent when expressly instructed to do so. He did however add that the respondent would instruct English solicitors, which he did in the form of M&amp;S Solicitors (&#8220;M&amp;S&#8221;). Correspondence ensued between PCB and M&amp;S during which M&amp;S made it clear that it was the respondent&#8217;s case that he had no obligation to accept service of the proceedings, to make himself available for service or to provide an address for service. No agreement was reached.</p>

Correspondence between the parties ensued and the application was adjourned by David Richards J. The adjourned application came on for hearing before Lewison J on 14 April 2010 on notice to M&amp;S, who wrote a detailed letter dated 25 March which was put before the court at their request.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Lewison J made a number of orders on 14 April 2010. They included, by paragraph 1, (without prejudice to paragraph 2) a further extension of the time for serving the claim form to 30 June 2010 and, by paragraph 2 (without prejudice to paragraph 1) an order permitting the appellants to serve the claim form by alternative means, that is by service on the respondent's English or Lebanese solicitors. The order extending time for service was made in case the alternative service order was set aside. In addition the judge adjourned the appellants&#8217; application for an order that the steps already taken on 22 October 2009 to bring the claim form to the attention of the respondent amounted to good service. He adjourned that application generally but gave the appellants permission to restore it. Lewison J gave a short judgment, to which I will refer below, which is of some importance because it was subsequently incorporated <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman Italic'">in extenso</span> into the judgment of the judge on the subsequent hearing <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman Italic'">inter partes</span>. In the event, service was duly effected by alternative means on the respondent's English solicitors in accordance with the order of 14 April 2010 and the respondent acknowledged service on 1 May 2010.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 21 May 2010 the respondent issued an application to set aside the various orders that had been made in the action. The application came before the judge, who heard it over four days from 7 December 2010. He gave judgment on 28 January 2011. He set out the background facts in detail between paras 1 and 19. He considered first the respondent&#8217;s application to set aside the order of Morgan J giving permission to serve out of the jurisdiction. He first rejected the respondent&#8217;s submission that there was no real issue between the parties which it is reasonable for the court to try under CPR 6.37(2). The respondent relied on two grounds, first that the effect of the settlement of the Haan action was to settle the appellants&#8217; claims against the respondent and, second, that the claims were time-barred. The judge held at paras 28 and 29 that the settlement agreement did not have that effect. As to limitation he held that, although the cause of action accrued on 26 March 2002 and would thus be time-barred as being more than six years before the issue of the claim form on 30 April 2009, the appellants had a good arguable case that they did not discover the fraud until 26 June 2003 or, alternatively May 2003, and that they could not have discovered it with reasonable diligence before 1 May 2003. It followed that the judge held that the appellants had a good arguable case that the claims were not time barred when the claim form was issued on 30 April 2009. The judge discussed this point in detail between paras 30 and 37 of his judgment.</p>

The judge discussed this point, again in detail, at paras 38 to 56. He concluded the point in favour of the appellants. He noted at para 54 that the appellants had given an undertaking to Morgan J not to pursue the claims in these proceedings in an action in Lebanon, which was both criminal and civil and (as explained by the judge at para 11) included the claims advanced in this action. None of these issues is relevant to this appeal.</p>

The respondent applied for orders setting aside the various orders extending time for service of the claim form, by Morgan J from 29 October to 31 December 2009, by Sales J from 31 December 2009 to 30 April 2010 and by Lewison J from 30 April 2010 to 30 June 2010. He also applied for an order setting aside Lewison J&#8217;s order permitting service by alternative means on the respondent&#8217;s Lebanese and English lawyers. The appellants cross-applied for a declaration that in the events which had happened there had been good service of the claim form on the respondent and for an order further extending the time to enable the claim form to be served through British Consular channels should the previous extensions of time stand but the order for alternative service made by Lewison J be set aside.</p>

The question, therefore, is whether there was a good reason to order that the steps taken on 22 October 2009 in Beirut to bring the claim form to the attention of the respondent constituted good service of the claim form upon him. The judge held that there was. In doing so, he was not exercising a discretion but was reaching a value judgment based on the evaluation of a number of different factors. In such a case, the readiness of an appellate court to interfere with the evaluation of the judge will depend upon all the circumstances of the case. The greater the number of factors to be taken into account, the more reluctant an appellate court should be to interfere with the decision of the judge. As I see it, in such circumstances an appellate court should only interfere with that decision if satisfied that the judge erred in principle or was wrong in reaching the conclusion which he did.</p>

The starting point is thus that the defendant has not been served by a method or at such a place otherwise so permitted. It therefore applies in cases (and only in cases) where none of the methods provided in rule 6.40(3), including &#8220;any other method permitted by the law of the country in which it is to be served&#8221; (see rule 6.40(3)(c)), has been successfully adopted. The only bar to the exercise of the discretion under rule 6.15(1) or (2), if otherwise appropriate, is that, by rule 6.40(4), nothing in a court order must authorise any person to do anything which is contrary to the law of the country where the claim form is to be served. So an order could not be made under rule 6.15(2) in this case if its effect would be contrary to the law of Lebanon. Although it was held that delivery of the claim form was not permitted service under Lebanese law, it was not suggested or held that delivery of the documents was contrary to Lebanese law or that an order of an English court that such delivery was good service under English law was itself contrary to Lebanese law.</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">The underlying claim raises serious allegations of fraud against the Defendant, Mr Baadarani; who is a Lebanese national. Attempts have been made to serve via the Consular authorities in the Lebanon in accordance with CPR Part 6, rule 42. Those attempts have proved very difficult, not least, because there is considerable uncertainty about the method by which service should be effected which, according to the evidence, goes back to a Treaty of the 1920s between the Lebanon and France. Nonetheless, the claim form and its accompanying documents were, to use a neutral word, delivered to Mr Baadarani&#8217;s Lebanese lawyer, who holds a power of attorney, which enables him to conduct proceedings, including proceedings in this jurisdiction. on Mr Baadarani's behalf. That lawyer signed for the papers and retained them for some four months before returning them. According to the claimant's Lebanese expert, that amounts to good service under Lebanese law. Nonetheless, Mr Baadarani appears to be denying that he has been properly served and has declined to provide an address for service.</p>

They have written a long letter of 25 March 2010, which has been placed before me and to which Mr Penny, who appears on behalf of the claimant, has quite properly referred. The points made in that letter have been addressed in the fifth witness statement of Mr Mascarenhas, which I have read.</p>

In other words, it is inherent in rule 6.37(5)(b)(i) that the court may make directions about alternative methods of service. Where the court is dealing with service of proceedings within the jurisdiction the court also has the power to declare that steps already taken to bring the proceedings to the notice of a defendant should count as good service. Mr Penny did at one stage submit that the same power applied to service out of the jurisdiction, but in the light of an interchange between him and me he is not pressing that submission and I am not ruling for or against it. I will adjourn that part of the application notice in case it becomes a live issue at a later date.&#8221;</p>

In particular Lewison J found, not only that Mr Azoury retained the documents delivered on 22 October 2009, but that they or a copy of them had been in the hands of the respondents&#8217; English lawyers prior to writing their long letter of 25 March 2010.

As already explained, an order under rule 6.15(2) may only be made where there is a good reason to authorise service by a method or at a place not otherwise permitted by Part 6. The judge could, therefore, not have made the declaration if he had taken the view that the delivery of the documents on 22 October was good service under Lebanese law. Moreover, it is in my opinion clear from the first sentence of para 74 that the judge was not holding that the delivery was good service under Lebanese law but that it was &#8220;to be treated as good service&#8221; under English law pursuant to CPR 6.15(2).</p>

Whether there was good reason is essentially a matter of fact. I do not think that it is appropriate to add a gloss to the test by saying that there will only be a good reason in exceptional circumstances. Under CPR 6.16, the court can only dispense with service of the claim form &#8220;in exceptional circumstances&#8221;. CPR 6.15(1) and, by implication, also 6.15(2) require only a &#8220;good reason&#8221;. It seems to me that in the future, under rule 6.15(2), in a case not involving the Hague Service Convention or a bilateral service treaty, the court should simply ask whether, in all the circumstances, there is good reason to order that steps taken to bring the claim form to the attention of the defendant is good service.</p>

On the other hand, the wording of the rule shows that it is a critical factor. As the editors of the 2013 edition of the White Book note (vol 1, para 6.15.5), rule 6.15(2) was designed to remedy what were thought to be defects as matters stood before 1 October 2008. The Court of Appeal had held in <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman Italic'">Elmes v Hygrade Food Products plc </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2001/121" uk:canonical="[2001] EWCA Civ 121" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] EWCA Civ 121</ref> that the court had no jurisdiction to order retrospectively that an erroneous method of service already adopted should be allowed to stand as service by an alternative method permitted by the court. The editors of the White Book add that the particular significance of rule 6.15(2) is that it may enable a claimant to escape the serious consequences that would normally ensue where there has been mis-service and, not only has the period for service of the claim form fixed by CPR 7.5 run, but also the relevant limitation period has expired.</p>

The fact that CPR 6.40(4) expressly states that nothing in any court order can authorise or require any person to do anything contrary to the law of the country in which the document is to be served does not mean that it can be appropriate to validate a form of service which, while not itself contrary to the local law in the sense of being illegal, is nevertheless not valid by that law.</p>

That is a consideration which has been of importance in determining whether permission to serve out of the jurisdiction should be granted, although in this regard I agree with the approach set out by Lord Sumption in his judgment. In any event, in this case, it is now accepted that it was proper to serve the claim form out of the jurisdiction. The rules as to the method of service set out above seem to me to have the legitimate sensibilities of other states in mind. It is for that reason that CPR 6.40(4) provides that nothing in CPR 6.40(3) or in any court order authorises or requires any person to do anything which is contrary to the law of the country of service. I have already expressed my view that the order recognising the delivery of the claim form as alternative service under English law is not contrary to Lebanese law. Moreover it was not in breach of any convention or treaty but merely recognised that the claim form (and other documents) had been brought to the attention of the respondent. I do not think, therefore, that in a case not involving the Hague Service Convention or a bilateral service treaty, an order under rule 6.15(2) must be regarded as &#8220;exceptional&#8221; or, indeed as suggested in para 29 of Longmore LJ&#8217;s judgment, that there must be a &#8220;very good reason&#8221; for it. As already stated, the CPR do not so provide. They merely require good reason.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">My third reason for disagreeing with the Court of Appeal concerns para 23 of Longmore LJ&#8217;s judgment, where he says that a claimant who wishes the court retrospectively to validate alternative service abroad must &#8220;<span style="font-family:Arial">(save perhaps where there are adequate safeguards which were not present in this case)&#8221;</span> show that the method used was good service under the local law. As noted above, that would render rule 6.15(1) and (2) otiose. <span style="font-family:Arial">Without the words in brackets, the proposition in para 23 would not be correct. It is not however clear to me what safeguards the court had in mind. In any event, for the reasons already stated, Longmore LJ was wrong in my view to suggest that a court needs a &#8220;very good reason&#8221; to make an order under rule 6.15(2) where the steps taken did not constitute valid service under local law.</span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The fourth reason arises out of the Court of Appeal&#8217;s reliance upon the fact that the appellants did not issue the claim form until nearly the end of the limitation period. At para 29 of his judgment, Longmore LJ stated:</p>

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">Since, therefore, Mr Azoury had no authority in fact to accept service and since he did not, in any event, purport to do so, the delivery of the claim form and associated documentation to him did not, in my view, constitute good service in Lebanese law. I do not, therefore, think that the judge should have retrospectively validated that service as alternative service to that directed by Morgan J unless there was very good reason to do so. The only reason to do so was to avoid the claim becoming time-barred, which is not in itself a good reason (let alone an exceptional reason) for preserving a stale claim. Mr Freedman submits that both personal service and service through diplomatic channels had become impossible, but that impossibility (as to which there was very little evidence) has only arisen as a result of the dilatory way in which the claimants have pursued the English claim. They were asking for trouble by only issuing their claim form shortly before the limitation expired. If the claim form had been issued say four years earlier, and a diligent process server had been instructed, Mr Baadarani might well have been served at one of the three address identified by Mr Houssami in his witness statement and the order of Morgan J would have been complied with. Four years might even have been long enough for diplomatic channels to be effective but it is not suggested that Mr Baadarani could only be served in that manner. If it really was proving impossible to effect service over that long period, an application for alternative service could still have been made well before the six year period had expired and no retroactive gymnastics would have been necessary.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As I read para 29, the delay prior to the issue of the claim form was a significant part of the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, although, as I understand it, it was not a point taken on behalf of the respondent. I would accept the submission that (save perhaps in exceptional circumstances) events before the issue of the claim form are not relevant. The focus of the inquiry on an issue of this kind is not and (so far as I am aware) has never been on events before the issue of the writ or claim form. The relevant focus is upon the reason why the claim form cannot or could not be served within the period of its validity. The judge held that there was an issue to be tried on the question whether the appellants&#8217; claim was time-barred. In resolving the issues of service, the court had therefore to treat the claim form as issued in time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This brings me to a consideration of the facts and to the fifth respect in which I respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal. In para 31 Longmore LJ said this:</p>

That evidence does not, in my judgment, show that there was such an ineffective attempt at service to constitute a good reason for not serving him at that address in such a way as to justify even an original order for alternative service pursuant to CPR 6.15(1) let alone an order that a form of service unilaterally chosen by the claimants should be deemed to be good service pursuant to CPR 6.15(2).&#8221;</p>

However, there is no reason to think that the appellants did not genuinely think that he did. Moreover there is no evidence that they could have found out what his address was, especially in circumstances where he was refusing to tell them where he lived. If he did not live at the Farid Trad Street address, further attempts to serve him there would have proved fruitless.</p>

As the judge explained, there were difficulties in serving the claim form, the appellants cannot be blamed for failing to ascertain his address, especially in circumstances in which the respondent instructed his lawyers to refuse to tell the appellants what it was. Moreover, the claim form was delivered to Mr Azoury&#8217;s office within the period of its validity, with the result that it came to the attention of the respondent. In all these circumstances he held that there was a good reason to grant the declaration. In my opinion there is no legitimate basis on which to interfere with that decision.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In his judgment in the Court of Appeal, Longmore LJ described the service of the English Court&#8217;s process out of the jurisdiction as an &#8220;exorbitant&#8221; jurisdiction, which would be made even more exorbitant by retrospectively authorising the mode of service adopted in this case. This characterisation of the jurisdiction to allow service out is traditional, and was originally based on the notion that the service of proceedings abroad was an assertion of sovereign power over the Defendant and a corresponding interference with the sovereignty of the state in which process was served. This is no longer a realistic view of the situation. The adoption in English law of the doctrine of <span style="font-style:italic">forum non conveniens</span> and the accession by the United Kingdom to a number of conventions regulating the international jurisdiction of national courts, means that in the overwhelming majority of cases where service out is authorised there will have been either a contractual submission to the jurisdiction of the English court or else a substantial connection between the dispute and this country. Moreover, there is now a far greater measure of practical reciprocity than there once was. Litigation between residents of different states is a routine incident of modern commercial life. A jurisdiction similar to that exercised by the English court is now exercised by the courts of many other countries. The basic principles on which the jurisdiction is exercisable by the English courts are similar to those underlying a number of international jurisdictional conventions, notably the Brussels Convention (and corresponding regulation) and the Lugano Convention. The characterisation of the service of process abroad as an assertion of sovereignty may have been superficially plausible under the old form of writ (&#8220;We command you&#8230;&#8221;). But it is, and probably always was, in reality no more than notice of the commencement of proceedings which was necessary to enable the Defendant to decide whether and if so how to respond in his own interest. It should no longer be necessary to resort to the kind of muscular presumptions against service out which are implicit in adjectives like &#8220;exorbitant&#8221;. The decision is generally a pragmatic one in the interests of the efficient conduct of litigation in an appropriate forum.</p>
