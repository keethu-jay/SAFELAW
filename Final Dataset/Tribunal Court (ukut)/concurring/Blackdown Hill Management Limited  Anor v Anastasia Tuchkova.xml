	    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">SEX DISCRIMINATION, UNFAIR DISMISSAL</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">The tribunal found that the claimant was dismissed for the fair reason of redundancy, but that the dismissal was unfair in all the circumstances of the case.  </p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">The tribunal did not err in concluding that one respect in which the dismissal was unfair, was because the respondent had failed to fairly consider whether the claimant should be placed in a pool of one or in a wider pool.  Nor did it err in its conclusion on <span style="font-style:italic">Polkey</span>.</p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">The tribunal erred in upholding four complaints of discrimination by way of unfavourable treatment of the claimant because she had exercised her right to take maternity leave (and associated complaints of direct sex discrimination).  The tribunal failed to apply the correct legal test of causation, or, if it considered that the claimant having exercised her right to take maternity leave was more than a contextual or background matter, it failed to explain why.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">Following a full merits hearing, the employment tribunal (EJ Siddall, Ms A Sansome and Mr A Peart, sitting at London South), upheld the claimant&#8217;s complaint of ordinary unfair dismissal and her complaints of conduct amounting to both maternity discrimination and direct discrimination because of sex, in respect of four matters.  Other complaints arising from the same factual background were dismissed.</p>

At a preliminary hearing in the EAT</span>, grounds 6 and 9 &#8211; 11 were dismissed upon withdrawal.  Grounds 1 &#8211; 5, 7 and 8 were permitted to proceed to a full appeal hearing.  I will continue to refer to the grounds by those numbers.  As he did before the tribunal, Mr Welch of counsel has appeared again today for the respondent.  The claimant was a litigant in person in the tribunal and is again in the EAT.  Mr Welch produced a written skeleton argument and tabled a bundle of authorities.  The claimant relied on the tribunal&#8217;s decision as correct for the reasons that it gave.  I heard oral submissions from Mr Welch and the claimant made a number of points in her oral reply. </p>

The claimant is a Russian-qualified lawyer, but does not hold a UK legal qualification.  Her employment with the first respondent began in January 2016, at a salary of &#163;40,000 per annum.  Although her title was Legal Project Manager she had a variety of tasks, including administration and project management.  These included liaising with Russian lawyers over certain litigation, and work related to an innovation project carried out through a separate limited company, Uniwheel Limited.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimant went on maternity leave on 1 March 2017.  She originally intended to return to work on 1 September 2017, but on 3 August she emailed the second respondent stating that she would like to delay her return until 1 March 2018, and that she would like to arrange keeping in touch (KIT) days.  Although a colleague initially responded asking her for dates of proposed KIT days, thereafter further emails from the claimant about that, and her proposed new return date, went unanswered.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">On 14 February 2018 the claimant emailed the second respondent and others that she was looking forward to returning on 1 March and asking for an update on work matters, including tasks she had handed over to colleagues when she had gone on maternity leave.  On 15 February, Ms Stenina, who the tribunal described as the second respondent&#8217;s PA and the HR manager, replied, inviting the claimant to a meeting with her and the second respondent.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">That meeting took place on 26 February 2018.  The discussion was in Russian.  As well as hearing from all three participants, the tribunal had an English translation of a sound recording of the meeting.  The tribunal found that, among other things, the second respondent told the claimant that &#8220;we are closing, cutting down on everything, I mean winding down&#8221; and that there was &#8220;no work&#8221;, and he advised her to look for another job.  He suggested that she could undertake the reviewing, filing and auditing of the first respondent&#8217;s legal documents in the meantime.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">On 28 February 2018 the claimant emailed asking if a redundancy consultation process was under way, about what redundancy package she would be offered, and about what she called the archiving project.  There was a brief reply from Ms Stenina on 2 March and one from the second respondent on 4 March indicating that he wanted to &#8220;discuss in person the redundancy agreement&#8221; when he was next in the office.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">Following a short period of illness the claimant returned to work on 5 March 2018.  She found that she could not get access to her email accounts as she did not have the passwords.  She also discovered that her lap top had been returned to factory settings and wiped clean.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">The claimant, the second respondent and Ms Stenina met again on 13 March 2018.  They discussed the so-called audit project.  The claimant asked what was happening about redundancy.  The second respondent noted that she was still being paid, and suggested that she could carry on working on a flexible basis and looking for another job at the same time.  At a certain point the claimant became upset.  The second respondent then received a call and left the meeting.  Ms Stenina then suggested that the claimant could go on working until she found another job, and then leave, although she also mentioned the possibility of a redundancy package if the claimant did not want to stay on.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">On 21 March 2018 the claimant went off sick with work-related stress.  At the same time she raised a grievance alleging discrimination because of maternity and complaining about the selection of her role for redundancy.  That led to a grievance meeting on 18 April.  On 30 April a designer working for Uniwheel Ltd, referred to as CB, resigned.  A letter of 4 May informed the claimant that her grievance was not upheld, that there was a redundancy situation, but that no final decision had been made, as there were several options.  The claimant appealed the grievance outcome.</p>

A grievance appeal outcome letter of 18 June reiterated that there was a genuine redundancy situation and that the claimant&#8217;s selection was not related to her maternity leave.  However, the grievance was partially upheld in relation to aspects of events following her return to work.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">Ms Stenina invited the claimant to a further meeting which take place on 3 July.  The claimant was provided with a proposal for a three-month fixed-term role of legal auditor and a proposed redundancy package.  On 13 July the claimant declined the alternative role as not suitable.  On 18 July Uniwheel staff were made redundant with immediate effect.  On 20 July the claimant&#8217;s employment was terminated with immediate effect for the given reason of redundancy.  The claimant appealed against that decision but her appeal was never actioned.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">In a section of its decision considering the reason for dismissal the tribunal went back over its findings as to how events had unfolded.  It concluded that by February 2018 the claimant had been forgotten about.  When she got in touch in February about her imminent return in March, Ms Stenina and the second respondent were taken by surprise.  </p>

However we recognise that this is not the correct question to ask ourselves as it involves a &#8216;but for&#8217; analysis. We go on to consider the reason why the Claimant was dismissed in July 2018 and to give consideration to the Respondent&#8217;s assertion that a genuine redundancy situation had arisen at that point. </span></p>

In addition the Russian litigation was not progressing. We therefore accept that the Second Respondent had reached a genuine view that some aspects of the First Respondent&#8217;s activities with which the Claimant had been involved had diminished or were likely to diminish. He set out his fears about the business to the Claimant at the meeting on 26 February 2018. </span></p>

However the Claimant&#8217;s selection for redundancy was pre-judged upon her return to work, before she or the Respondents had established what projects were remaining and could be taken back. It was not reasonable for the Respondents to conclude in February 2018 that her role was unique and had disappeared without carrying out further assessment. It would have been reasonable to carry out a wider analysis of who was doing what in the office and the extent to which the Claimant&#8217;s role had been absorbed. </span></p>

As a result of the way in which the meetings on 26 February and 13 March 2018 were conducted, trust between the parties was badly damaged and a constructive dialogue around an alternative became very difficult if not impossible. Had a proper and genuine consultation process started at an appropriate time prior to July 2018 it is possible either that the Claimant would have kept her job or that a permanent alternative role would have been offered and accepted. We assess that possibility as being reasonably low as we find that the Claimant would not have accepted a role on a considerably lower salary (in the region of &#163;24-25,000) and nor had she expressed an interest in part time hours. After considering all the evidence we put this chance at 25%.&#8221;</span></p>

In fact on 26 February she was told that there was no job for her. This despite the fact that the Claimant&#8217;s role had been distributed to other people, no proper reply to a request for a detailed handover was provided and the Claimant, although instructed to carry out an assessment of all the legal projects that had been underway when she commenced her leave, was in practice unable to carry out this task. In the circumstances this amounted to unfavourable treatment. The reason why she was not able to return to her previous job was the fact that she had taken maternity leave and her work had been redistributed and was not returned to her.

The Respondents have not disputed the fact that the laptop appeared to have been wiped clean upon the Claimant&#8217;s return and partially upheld her grievance upon this ground. Ms Stenina and the Second Respondent speculated as to the reasons why the laptop might have been cleaned (to protect confidential information or provide the laptop for someone else to use) without providing any clear evidence as to the reasons why this was done. We can only conclude that the folders were removed from the laptop and it was returned to factory settings because the Claimant had gone on maternity leave. This factor combined with the fact that the laptop was not restored upon her return plainly amounted to unfavourable treatment. The Claimant was not able to update herself or commence the assessment task that she had been given without it and we note that even on 20 March 2018 this information was not available to her. This significantly curtailed her ability to carry out her job. </span></p>

The Claimant had been copied into an email where this instruction was given. However it would not have been surprising if the Claimant had missed this whilst on leave. This also indicates that staff in the office were aware that the folders were available on someone else&#8217;s machine and it begs the question why the files were not restored to the Claimant&#8217;s laptop prior to or very soon after her return. By suggesting that the Claimant could have asked this other member of staff for a copy, the Respondents seem to be placing the burden on the Claimant to sort this matter out. In fact we find that the information had not been provided to the Claimant by the time she went off sick on 21 March 2018. We find that the reason why the folders had been removed was because the Claimant had gone on maternity leave. This claim succeeds against the First Respondent only. There is no suggestion that the Second Respondent ordered the laptop to be wiped clean or that he obstructed the retrieval of the files. </span></p>

The Second Respondent had not given any thought to the fact that the Claimant&#8217;s work had been distributed to others whilst she was away, nor had he evaluated what parts of her job remained notwithstanding the changes in the business in the meantime. We find that the statements made to the Claimant amounted to unfavourable treatment and that the reason why these statements were made is the fact that she had been on maternity leave. The reason why the Second Respondent told the Claimant to look for another job is that she had been absent on maternity leave and she would not have been told that in any other situation including a formal redundancy consultation.

This was not a case, submitted Mr Welch, where such a picture was painted in evidence by the respondents, but not accepted by the tribunal or found to be a sham.  As found by the tribunal, the claimant&#8217;s return to work had coincided with these developments.  This was the background against which her complaints of treatment contrary to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 18</ref> and 13 fell to be considered.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">The headline of ground 1 is that the tribunal applied the wrong legal test when considering whether the less favourable or unfavourable treatment complained about by the claimant was because of maternity or sex.  Mr Welch submitted that, while the tribunal had given itself a correct self-direction as to the legal test, by reference to the <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Martinez</span> case, the tribunal failed to apply that test correctly, when it came to reach its conclusions.  In particular, he submitted, it had applied a &#8220;related to&#8221; test, rather than considering, as it should have, whether the conduct in question was &#8220;because&#8221; the claimant had exercised her right to maternity leave.  It had also failed to consider whether the fact that the claimant had taken maternity leave had, whether consciously or not, materially influenced the mind of the decision-maker concerned in relation to each of these matters.

Both <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18</ref> and section 13 use the word &#8220;because&#8221;, and the same approach to what may be called the causation test applies in relation to both.  It is an error to apply a &#8220;but for&#8221; test.  Nor would it be sufficient that the fact that the complainant took maternity leave provides the context of, or background to, the impugned conduct.  The conduct must be &#8220;because&#8221; she exercised that right, in the sense that this must have materially influenced the decision, by operating, whether consciously or not, on the mind of the decision-maker.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">I take, first, the first of the four complaints which were upheld.  I have already set out what the tribunal said at [145], in particular: &#8220;The reason why she was not able to return to her previous job was the fact that she had taken maternity leave and her work was redistributed and was not returned to her&#8221;.  This immediately poses a potential difficulty, as the tribunal had properly found that the redistribution of the claimant&#8217;s work, upon her going on maternity leave, was <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> itself a discriminatory act; and the tribunal does not further explain why it has concluded that the reason why she was not able to return to her previous job was the fact that she had taken maternity leave in a sense that would properly found liability under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18</ref>.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">Further, as Mr Welch fairly submitted, the tribunal had, in the course of its decision, in particular at [95], made a finding that the second respondent had, in the spring of 2018, reached a  &#8220;genuine view&#8221; that some aspects of the first respondent&#8217;s activities, with which the claimant had been involved, had diminished or were likely to diminish, and he set out his fears about the business at the meeting on 26 February.  Whilst he had come to this conclusion, the tribunal found, with insufficient thought, and, unfairly, without consulting the claimant, those findings would not, as such, support a finding that this conduct was &#8220;because&#8221; the claimant had exercised her right to take maternity leave in the requisite legal sense; and, I agree with Mr Welch, they would tend to point away from such a conclusion.</p>

However, for these reasons it appears to me that the tribunal did not address whether, or, if it was in fact its view, explain why, the fact that the second respondent had come to the view that there was no job available for the claimant upon her return, pointed also to the conclusion that he had done so <span style="font-style:italic">because</span> &#8211; in the requisite legal sense &#8211; the claimant had taken maternity leave.</p>

There it stated that the reason for the lack of sufficient consultation was &#8220;directly related to the fact that she had taken maternity leave&#8221;.  That is not the correct test.  The conclusion at [156] overlaps factually with, and directly draws upon, the conclusion in relation to the first successful complaint.  </p>

Either way, the tribunal&#8217;s conclusions in relation to the first and fourth successful complaints under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18</ref> and section 13 cannot stand.</p>

While the tribunal here did use the word &#8220;because&#8221;, there is a potential ambiguity, the phrase being &#8220;because the claimant <span style="font-style:italic">had gone on</span> maternity leave&#8221;.  It would not be sufficient had the tribunal concluded that the claimant exercising her right to go on maternity leave was a &#8220;but for&#8221; cause of this conduct, but not in the requisite sense a material operative cause of it.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">On its face, the tribunal appears to have considered that it had not been given a clear explanation for why this had happened, as neither Ms&#160;Stenina nor the second respondent had personally removed the files from the claimant&#8217;s laptop.  So, in the tribunal&#8217;s view, they were only able to speculate about why this had been done.  Although the tribunal does not refer to the statutory shifting of the burden of proof, on a generous reading it might be inferred that it considered that, on this matter, the burden had shifted and not been discharged.  If so, Mr&#160;Welch&#8217;s further criticism, that the tribunal had failed to make a finding of fact about which individual it was who actually took the files off the laptop, would not matter.</p>

First it is said that both Ms&#160;Stenina and the second respondent gave evidence that was not speculative, but was in terms to the effect that the reason that the claimant&#8217;s laptop had been wiped was because the files had been preserved by being copied, and the laptop was then wiped so that it was available to be used by other employees.  </p>

I need to be mindful of the fact that I do not have before me all of the evidence that the tribunal had on this subject, and I am not remaking the tribunal&#8217;s findings of fact. </p>

Once again, the challenge is put in the alternative as perversity, this time by ground 5.  Again, regrettably, the tribunal&#8217;s reasoning is problematic in a number of respects.  At [151] the tribunal itself finds that much of the second respondent&#8217;s behaviour at the meetings on 26 February and 13&#160;March 2018 was related to his management style and <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> to the fact the claimant had been on maternity leave.  This reinforces my misgivings in relation to the conclusions on other complaints.

In particular, it does not explain its conclusion that she would not have been told to look for another job in any other situation, including a formal redundancy consultation; or how that conclusion fitted with its conclusion that the second respondent genuinely believed as of February, that there had been a diminution in work affecting the claimant&#8217;s position.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">Ground 2 asserts that, in relation to the first three matters in respect of which the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18</ref> complaint succeeded, the tribunal erred by failing to give any consideration to whether those complaints, as such, were out of time; and hence, if they were, whether to extend time.  These three matters all related to what happened when, or shortly after, the claimant returned from maternity leave.  ACAS early conciliation in respect of the first respondent began on 5 August and ended on 30 August 2018 and in respect of the second respondent began and ended on 3 October.  The claim form was presented on 10 October 2018.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr&#160;Welch&#8217;s short point was that, on any view, the first three matters of conduct complained of occurred or concluded more than three months before not only the claim form was presented but before ACAS early conciliation began in respect of either respondent.  No extension of time to take account of the period of ACAS early conciliation therefore applied; and, as complaints in their own right, all of these matters were out of time.  The tribunal simply failed to address this at all in its decision, notwithstanding that written and oral submissions were made about it.  In any event, said Mr&#160;Welch, this was a jurisdictional question that the tribunal was obliged to consider. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">In reply, the claimant made a number of points about what was going on during this period and why she did not commence ACAS early conciliation and/or present her claim form sooner than she did.  However, whether or not the tribunal might have been persuaded by such points to extend her time or, indeed, whether or not it might have concluded that these matters, together with other treatment, formed a continuing act of discrimination over time, the difficulty is that it has not addressed the time question at all.  I therefore uphold ground 2, as a further reason why the tribunal erred with respect to the first three of the four <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/18" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 18</ref>/13 complaints that succeeded.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">I turn to ground 3.  The headline of this ground asserts that the tribunal erred &#8220;by substituting its view for that of the commercial judgment of management that there was work for the claimant to do on her return to the business in February 2018&#8221;.  Mr&#160;Welch confirmed that the sense of this ground was that the tribunal had wrongly substituted its view that there was work for the claimant to do, for management&#8217;s view that there was not.  Whilst this ground uses the language of wrongful substitution, it seems to me that it is, in substance, really a perversity challenge to findings of fact made by the tribunal.  We are not concerned here, for example, with a challenge to a finding of unfair dismissal, to the effect that the tribunal has wrongly substituted its commercial business judgment for that of the respondent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.53in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr&#160;Welch confirmed that there are two places where he says that the tribunal made perverse findings.  The first is at [68] where it says that it does not accept the second respondent&#8217;s evidence that he had concluded that he no longer had a need for a legal project manager, prior to receiving the claimant&#8217;s email of 14 February 2018.  It seems to me that it was for the tribunal to decide whether it accepted the second respondent&#8217;s evidence on that point; and this finding by it is consistent with its findings elsewhere, that he had not given any thought to the claimant or her position and, indeed, had forgotten about her, prior to receiving her email of 14 February 2018, and then only gave thought to these matters thereafter.</p>

Again, this was matter for the tribunal to make a finding of fact about, having heard the evidence.  [74] is a long paragraph, but the gist is that the tribunal accepted that the second respondent considered that there was a diminution, in particular in the Russian litigation activity and the Uniwheel business activity, and that he was considering further winding down the first respondent&#8217;s activities.  But what the tribunal also found was that he had not at that stage come to a definite conclusion about those activities.  </p>

Those conclusions were properly reached and are, indeed, consistent with the tribunal&#8217;s findings elsewhere about what stage his thought processes had reached in February, and then how they developed over the succeeding months.  Ground 3 is therefore not upheld.</p>

Ground 7 states that the tribunal erred by finding that it was unfair to have placed the claimant in a pool of one.  Ostensibly that is, as such, a challenge to part of the tribunal&#8217;s reasoning on liability as to why the dismissal was unfair.  But Mr&#160;Welch accepted in argument that, because the tribunal had also found the dismissal to be unfair for other reasons not challenged by this appeal, even if ground 1 were to succeed, the finding that the dismissal was unfair, as such, would stand.  But success on ground 7 could nevertheless have potential implications for remedy.</p>

The submission is that the tribunal reached an impermissible <span style="font-style:italic">conclusion</span> that the pool should have been just the claimant.  I drew to Mr&#160;Welch&#8217;s attention that this question has been considered again by the EAT in two recent authorities: <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Mogane v Bradford Teaching Hospitals</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/eat/2022/139" uk:canonical="[2022] EAT 139" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EAT 139</ref> and <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Teixeira v Zaika Restaurant</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/eat/2022/171" uk:canonical="[2022] EAT 171" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2022">[2022] EAT 171</ref>.  The short point is that even where the claimant&#8217;s job appears to be uniquely at risk, the tribunal should be cautious before proceeding directly to conclude that it would automatically be fair to place her alone in a pool of one.  </p>

Mr&#160;Welch submits that the tribunal could not properly have so found.  That is because, of these five people, one was the finance director, two were contractors and the remaining two were in lower paid roles, and the tribunal elsewhere found that the claimant was not interested in taking a role of a PA at &#163;25,000 per annum.</p>

It said at [116] that it accepted that there had been a diminution in the work being done by the claimant, but it considered that it would have been reasonable to carry out a wider analysis of who was doing what in the office and the extent to which the claimant&#8217;s role had been absorbed.  </p>

But in the present case the unfairness identified by the tribunal, specifically at [118], was that failure to conduct an evaluation and selection exercise.  It seems to me that the tribunal was not saying that it would necessarily have been wrong for the respondent to have arrived at a pool of one, but that the unfairness lay in that question not having been considered or adequately considered.  The points made by Mr&#160;Welch, in particular about the finance director, and the question of whether the claimant would have taken a job at a lower salary, do not go to the tribunal&#8217;s criticism of the respondents having given insufficient or any attention to the formulation of the pool, as such.</p>

In the course of its <span style="font-style:italic">Polkey</span> reasoning, the tribunal made the point at [134] that consideration of the appropriate pool may have resulted in a reorganisation of the office or in a wider pool being created.  It considered the possibility that, even so, the claimant might still have been selected, but properly found that this was not a certainty.  It specifically considered the point that she was one of the highest paid staff and would not have accepted a PA role.  It properly concluded that it was unlikely that she would have accepted a job at a much lower salary.  But it considered that it was not able entirely to rule that out and noted that there was a possibility that a role might have emerged for her if there had been a proper consultation and selection exercise, considering both the work she had been doing and the activities of the office as a whole.  It noted also that the lack of a fair consultation had damaged the relationship and the possibility of constructive dialogue.  </p>

It may at its highest be said that putting the chances as it did, of the claimant having remained in employment in a role with a considerably lower salary, at 25 percent, the tribunal&#8217;s assessment was on the generous side.  But I do not think it can be said that that assessment was one that was untenable having regard to the tribunal&#8217;s consideration of the facts found and evidence available to it.  </p>
