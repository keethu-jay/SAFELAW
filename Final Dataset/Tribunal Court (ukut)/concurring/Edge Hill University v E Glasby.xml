	    <p><span style="font-weight:bold">SUMMARY &#8211; Practice and Procedure</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">The claimant was dismissed by the respondent on grounds of capability on account of her record of high levels of sickness absence.  The employment tribunal upheld three complaints of failure to comply with the duty of reasonable adjustment, one unanimously, and two by a majority.  The majority also upheld two complaints of discrimination arising from disability (section 15 <span style="font-weight:bold"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref></span>), one of which related to the dismissal.</p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">The tribunal&#8217;s (or majority&#8217;s) reasons in relation to the complaints which were upheld were fundamentally inadequate and/or defective.  </p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">There were no, or no sufficient, reasons given at all in relation to some or all of the essential elements of the three reasonable-adjustment complaints that were upheld.  </p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">The reasons in relation to the first of the section 15 complaints also had gaps in relation to essential elements of the cause of action.  The decision on the section 15 complaint relating to dismissal turned on the justification defence.  The majority of the tribunal relied on its conclusions that the respondent should have discounted cancer-related absences and that they did not accept the evidence of the respondent&#8217;s witnesses about the impact of the claimant&#8217;s absence on other staff, which the majority stated that they considered had been created to suit the circumstances.  However, the latter conclusion was in conflict with earlier findings of fact made unanimously by the whole tribunal, did not reflect the claimant&#8217;s own case, and in any event required some explanatory reasoning to support it.  </p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify">The appeal was allowed and consideration of the complaints in question remitted for fresh determination.</p>

The claimant appeared in person; the respondent was represented by Ms&#160;Barry of counsel.  The tribunal reserved its decision and had a further day in chambers in May 2021.  Its reserved judgment and reasons were sent to the parties in October 2022.  We were told that it is understood that the significant delay was occasioned by the ill-health of the judge.  Although the grounds of appeal refer to this aspect, Ms&#160;Barry confirmed in oral argument today that delay, as such, was not advanced as a distinct ground of appeal.  </p>

By a majority, the lay members of the panel, Mr&#160;S&#160;Anslow and Mrs&#160;A Jarvis, also upheld two other complaints of failure to comply with the duty of reasonable adjustment and the two complaints of discrimination arising from disability contrary to section 15.  The judge, Employment Judge S Warren, in the minority, would have dismissed all of those four complaints.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.93in;text-indent:0.5in">There were two section 15 complaints which, as we have said, the majority upheld.  The first related to the respondent having told the claimant at a stage 4 meeting in December 2018 that it would not agree to her request to disregard previous disability-related periods of sickness absence when applying the sickness absence policies.  The second related to the decision to dismiss the claimant in February 2019.  The reasonable-adjustment complaints which the majority upheld related to that December 2018 decision to decline to disregard disability-related periods of sickness absence, and to an earlier decision not to permit the claimant to use additional annual leave that she had purchased, to cover some of her days of sickness absence.  </p>

At paragraphs [10] to [71], the tribunal made unanimous findings of fact.  These covered fully the relevant chronology of events in relation to the claimant&#8217;s employment and periods of sickness absence up to and including the decision to dismiss her and her unsuccessful internal appeal.  The tribunal also made findings about the respondent&#8217;s relevant policies, being the short-term absence policy and a long-term absence policy.  </p>

A section headed &#8220;discussion&#8221; at paragraphs [101] to [114] is, it was common ground, in fact a continuing discussion of submissions made by the respondent.  The tribunal&#8217;s conclusions are in their entirety set out in the next section of the decision which is, indeed, headed &#8220;conclusions&#8221;; and we will return to it.</p>

She worked in student services in one position or another, for ten hours per week in term times, amounting to 36 weeks per year.  In July 2005 she began doing concurrently another part-time job as an administration assistant working on the information desk in the faculty of education, working 25 hours per week, year round.  At the relevant times, her line manager in the student services role was Phillipa Dunning and her line manager in the faculty of education role was Philip Jones.  </p>

These include findings about the reasons for each absence, its duration and the steps taken by the respondent to support the claimant and to manage the absences at each stage, including by way of various adjustments and occupational health referrals.  These absences were later documented, and these steps summarised by the two line managers themselves, in a report that they compiled in January 2019, to which we will come.</p>

On 20 September 2018 the claimant communicated to Mr&#160;Jones that she was finding the doors to the student services section of the new building too heavy to open on her own.  The tribunal found that, upon being told this, Mr&#160;Jones immediately arranged for those doors to be kept open during the hours each day that the claimant did that job, pending, as he envisaged, an automated control being fitted.  However, there was then a specific occasion, which it appears was later in September, when the claimant arrived early for her shift and was unable to gain entry to the section until someone came and let her in.  </p>

The claimant returned to work again on a phased basis from 1 November 2018 and there was a return to work discussion thereafter.  She was absent again from 20 to 30 November 2018, returning to work on 3 December.  There was then a stage 4 meeting on 14 December 2018 with Ms&#160;Dunning and Mr&#160;Jones.  They had an HR advisor with them.  The claimant was accompanied by her union representative.  Various matters were discussed.  </p>

Somebody else had been appointed but half of the role was to cover health and safety, and she had not managed to get that work done because she was covering the claimant&#8217;s role in reception.  Ms&#160;Dunning made the point that they carry forward a backlog of work but they had really struggled this year and she did not have anyone to pass it to.  She had been unable to complete the audit.  She did not feel it could be sustained.  There was a backlog of filing and a backlog for auditing.  </span></p>

The claimant confirmed that she did not feel it necessary to go to see Dr&#160;Shah again and other wellbeing options were discussed.  The claimant also confirmed that the issue with the doors had been resolved (page 184).  The claimant was reminded that they may have to consider termination of her employment.&#8221;</span></p>

It was noted that between 11 February 2002 and 30 November 2018 the claimant had taken 1187 days of absence.  The claimant had been held at intermittent policy stage three as a reasonable adjustment in September 2016, and at intermittent policy stage four as a reasonable adjustment in March 2017.  She had been given special paid leave days.  The support that had been offered to her was listed (page 190).  It was noted that the claimant had requested two adjustments &#8211; the first being to continue to be allowed to use annual or flexi leave instead of recording absence as a period of sickness.  Previously, the university had supported the claimant with allowing the use of such leave in place of recording as a period of sickness absence, however it was noted in the March 2017 stage four meeting that this would not be allowed going forward as it masked the absences and therefore made it difficult to provide the correct level of support.  She also asked, in September 2018, that previous and future absences relating to either of her disabilities be disregarded in relation to sickness monitoring and recording. </span></p>

It was noted that the current position at the time of the recommendation being made that occupational health considered that the claimant could have a flare-up of her condition in the future and if it was severe enough may require time from work.  The claimant did not require any new adjustments at work.  The claimant had been offered the opportunity of adjusting her weekly working pattern and consolidating her hours in student services to enable her attendance, but she had indicated that would not be helpful in managing her attendance and had only been helpful when her daughter had been coming into the university at similar times.  The claimant was told the option was still available to her.  It was noted that the claimant had said no further support of adjustments were required. </span></p>

There had been a substantial increase in pressure on both the faculty of education information desk and the student services as a result of the claimant&#8217;s continued absence.  Within the faculty of education, the absence of the claimant provided a strain on the other information desk colleagues and other professional support colleagues.  The other two colleagues undertook additional responsibilities as part of their time on the information desk, for example health and safety and the processing of student travel expenses, and they had been unable to complete their tasks because of covering the desk in the sessions where the claimant would have been in attendance.  Within student services a proportion of the work that should have been completed had been completed by two student information officers.  This was over 100 hours of scanning, shredding and filing.  The two officers who had picked this backlog were no longer available in the team and not a resource that could be drawn on in the future.  A manager had had to carry out the additional checks on student support fund application forms, normally completed by the claimant, adding to the manager&#8217;s workload.  In order to catch up from 2017 to 2018 student services would have to recruit and train temporary staff to complete the work, and also to clear the backlog of work that had accrued in 2018 and 2019.  The money advice service was unable to sustain further delays to compliance and audit checks.  They were recruiting temporary staff to undertake those tasks.  There continued to be an impact on the team. </span></p>

The absences had occurred every year except one (in 2011) of her 16 years 11 months&#8217; employment.  It equated to a career average of approximately 70 sickness absence days per year and over the last five years the average number of sickness absence days per year had increased to 99 absence days per year on average.  Such a persistent high level of absence over a significant period indicated that the claimant was unable to attain a satisfactory level of attendance despite the ongoing support, interventions and reasonable adjustments that had been implemented, and so a recommendation for termination of employments on the grounds of poor attendance was tabled for consideration.&#8221;</span></p>

Both were unable to provide complete cover without disadvantage to others, in the claimant&#8217;s absence.  In her role with the faculty of education things such as filing and updating records were substantially behind after her absences.  With regard to the information desk, health and safety matters were not completed because of the member of staff having to cover the information desk rather than doing her other tasks.  In addition, it was not always possible to provide complete cover throughout the working day, which was required on the information desk.   </span></p>

Mrs&#160;Jarvis considered it unreasonable to disregard all of the previous absences.  However, she noted that there had been a period of 22 months with no issues; the claimant&#8217;s cancer was in remission and if the time she had taken out for disability absences was excluded from the calculation, there would have been 11 days&#8217; absence which would not have triggered a stage 4 policy meeting.  She considered that the respondent employer should have treated it more sympathetically than they did.

When balancing that against the legitimate aims of the university it left the respondent in a position of vulnerability as an employer as they had no idea what would happen in the future.

The decision that disability-related absences would not be disallowed, as requested by the claimant, was communicated at the stage 4 meeting in December 2018.

We note that, in the course of those findings, the tribunal found that the doors were large and heavy; and it appears to have accepted that the claimant, as a wheelchair user, could not physically open them unaided.  The tribunal also found that the claimant did not complain about the matter until 20 September 2018, at which point it was immediately arranged that the doors would be kept open during her shifts.  It also found that upon further investigation it was concluded that for structural reasons automatic openers and closers could not be fitted to these particular doors.  There are findings elsewhere in the decision about the new building having been designed with insufficient thought for the needs of wheelchair users.</p>

It can perhaps be fairly inferred from the decision of the majority on the section 15 complaint relating to the dismissal, that they considered within that context, that it would have been a reasonable adjustment in this case to discount the cancer-related absences when it came to the substantive decision which, ultimately, was to dismiss.  Hence we might infer that the majority considered that it would have been a reasonable adjustment in December to agree to depart from the policy in that regard.  But, nevertheless, a discrete reasonable adjustment complaint was advanced in relation to the communication in December, of the decision to decline to depart from the policy, and given that it was advanced as a discrete complaint, the tribunal needed to address the time issue that arose in relation to that discrete complaint.</p>

Nevertheless, as the additional complaint about what the claimant was told at the prior stage 4 meeting was maintained, as an additional and discrete complaint, the majority did need to address the time point in relation to it and whether, for example, it considered that this formed a continuing act taken together with the subsequent dismissal.

The respondent had submitted that this particular complaint was fundamentally flawed, because previous sickness absence would, under the respondent&#8217;s policy, never be discounted, whether it was high level or not.  The claimant&#8217;s high levels of sickness absence were therefore, argued the respondent, not something which, as such, caused the respondent not to discount the disability-related absences.</p>

It is clear that the view of the majority of the tribunal was that, in deciding what to do, whatever the policy said, the respondent should in this case have discounted the disability-related absences on account of the claimant&#8217;s cancer and related aftermath.  That was on the footing that the cancer had, by the time the decision was taken, been treated and was in remission, and so, in effect, was a thing of the past.  The majority&#8217; view was, further, that, if that lengthy period of absence <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> discounted, and having regard to their conclusion about the evidence concerning the impacts of the claimant&#8217;s absences, it was then not a proportionate response to dismiss at that stage.</p>

Insofar as the majority upheld the former complaint, it appears to us that they did need to engage with the respondent&#8217;s argument that the reason why the claimant was told that the absences would not be discounted was not because of the disability-related absences themselves, but because the policies required all absences to be counted, long or short as the case may be, and disability-related or not.

The focus of the attack mounted by ground 7, in particular, is on the majority&#8217;s conclusion at paragraph [126] that they did not accept that other staff were placed under additional burdens by the claimant&#8217;s absence, the avoidance of which appears to have been accepted as a legitimate aim, along with the other aims relied upon, as such; and that the majority of the tribunal considered that the respondent&#8217;s witnesses had created the evidence about this to suit the circumstances.</p>
