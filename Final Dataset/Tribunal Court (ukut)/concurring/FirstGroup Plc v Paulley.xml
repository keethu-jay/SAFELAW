	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">At around 9.35 in the morning of 24 February 2012, Mr Doug Paulley, who is a wheelchair user, arrived at Wetherby bus station, expecting to catch the 9.40 bus (&#8220;the Bus&#8221;) to Leeds. On arrival at Leeds he intended to catch the train to Stalybridge to meet his parents for lunch. The Bus was operated by a subsidiary of FirstGroup PLC (&#8220;FirstGroup&#8221;), which is the parent company of a group of companies which operates a total of about 6,300 buses. The Bus was equipped with a lowering platform and a wheelchair ramp. The Bus also had a space (a &#8220;space&#8221;) for wheelchairs, which included a sign that read &#8220;Please give up this space if needed for a wheelchair user.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">When Mr Paulley started to board the Bus, the driver, Mr Britcliffe, asked him to wait because the space was occupied by a woman with a sleeping child in a pushchair. The space had a sign with the familiar designation of a wheelchair sign, and in addition it had a notice (&#8220;the Notice&#8221;) saying &#8220;Please give up this space for a wheelchair user&#8221;. Mr Britcliffe asked the woman to fold down her pushchair and move out of the space so that Mr Paulley could occupy it in his wheelchair. She replied that her pushchair did not fold down, and refused to move. Mr Paulley then asked whether he could fold down his wheelchair and use an ordinary passenger seat. Mr Britcliffe refused that request, because there was no safe way of securing the wheelchair and the Bus had to take a rather winding route.</p>

The consequence of this was that Mr Paulley missed his train at Leeds, and had to take a later train which arrived at Stalybridge an hour later than he had planned.</p>

His claim was based on the proposition that FirstGroup had failed to make &#8220;reasonable adjustments&#8221; to its policies contrary to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/29/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 29(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The evidence before the Recorder established that Mr Britcliffe had followed FirstGroup&#8217;s policy, by asking the woman with the pushchair to move from the space, but, when she refused, by taking the matter no further. Mr Birtwhistle, FirstGroup&#8217;s UK Bus Projects Manager, told the Recorder that &#8220;in the main&#8221; passengers complied with a request to give up the space. Mr Birtwhistle also explained why FirstGroup had adopted the policy set out in paras 7 and 8 above. The company had carried out a review of the way it communicated with its customers, and found that many of them thought that it was putting up too many peremptory notices on buses. FirstGroup had concluded that it would be better policy to use more pleasant and engaging notices which were friendlier to customers. So far as FirstGroup&#8217;s policy about the space was concerned, Mr Birtwhistle said that it was designed to cause the customer to think &#8220;Somebody else needs this space. I will be reasonable. I will move away from it.&#8221; The policy was intended to be non-confrontational and placatory.</p>

Paragraph 2 of that Schedule required the Bus to have at least one wheelchair space on the lower deck, which had to comply with para 3 or 4. The Bus complied with para 4, which contains detailed specifications as to the size and other characteristics of the space, and also envisages that a folding or tip-up seat may be placed in the space, and requires there to be a notice on or near such a seat stating &#8220;Please give up this seat for a wheelchair user&#8221;. The Bus was also required to carry a sign adjacent to the space which showed a representation of a person in a wheelchair. Paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 to the Accessibility Regulations requires there to be at least four seats designated &#8220;as priority seats for use by disabled passengers&#8221;, and a sign on or near a priority seat &#8220;indicating that disabled persons have priority for the use of that seat&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Recorder considered that there was no difference of substance between FirstGroup&#8217;s policy at the time of the incident and its policy at the time of the hearing. (I am not sure that I agree, but the contrary was not argued, and it is not an issue which needs to be resolved on this appeal. In so far as it is relevant, this judgment is directed to the current policy, ie as set out in para 8 above). He found that this policy was a PCP, which he described as a &#8220;policy &#8230; of &#8216;first come first served&#8217;, &#8230; whereby a non-wheelchair user occupying the space on the bus would be requested to move but if the request was refused nothing more would be done&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Recorder also found that this PCP was a policy which placed Mr Paulley and other wheelchair users at a substantial disadvantage by comparison with non-disabled bus passengers. Crucially for present purposes, the Recorder went on to hold that there were reasonable adjustments that FirstGroup could have made to the PCP which would have eliminated that disadvantage. Those reasonable steps were, at least as I read his judgment, (i) an alteration to the Notice which would positively require a non-disabled passenger occupying a space to move from it if a wheelchair user needed it, coupled with (ii) an enforcement policy that would require non-disabled passengers to leave the bus if they failed to comply with that requirement. In this connection, it is common ground that FirstGroup&#8217;s conditions of carriage do not give a driver power to require, let alone to force (as opposed to request) a non-wheelchair user to move out of a space needed by a wheelchair user, or to leave the bus if she refuses to do so.</p>

In my view once the system had been advertised and in place there would be unlikely to be caused any disruption or confrontation as all passengers would know where they were. Although such a policy might inconvenience a mother with a buggy that, I am afraid is a consequence of the protection that Parliament has chosen to give to disabled wheelchair users and not to non-disabled mothers with buggies. I agree with the claimant that the [Conduct] Regulations do not really assist the court in determining whether the proposed adjustment suggested by the claimant is reasonable or not.&#8221; (para 21)</p>

They said that the proper approach started by accepting that FirstGroup had a PCP which involved &#8220;operating its buses on a &#8216;first come first served basis&#8217;&#8221; and then asking &#8220;whether the modification to that PCP, namely to request but not to require non-wheelchair users to vacate the space, and if necessary the bus, when a wheelchair user wants to use the space, is an adjustment that went far enough to comply with the duty to make reasonable adjustments&#8221;.

Also, the temperaments and experience of different drivers are bound to vary: some would handle such a situation well, but others might find it difficult to cope with.

Bus drivers have to use their powers of persuasion with passengers who can move voluntarily. The driver may even decline for a short while to drive on until someone moves out of the wheelchair space. There is no risk of liability to such passengers in requesting them (firmly) to move, if they can, because if they cannot safely do so, they will not do so. The bus company should also have an awareness campaign and put up notices designed to make other passengers more aware of the needs of wheelchair users.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In reaching their conclusion, the Court of Appeal considered that the Recorder was wrong to ignore the Conduct Regulations. In para 49 of his judgment, in a passage with which Underhill and Arden LJJ agreed, Lewison LJ pointed out that each of the anti-social activities identified by the Recorder in the passage quoted in para 12 above &#8220;is expressly prohibited by the Conduct Regulations, and the police can be called in aid of the driver under regulation 8(2)&#8221;. Accordingly, he continued, &#8220;[i]n these cases the driver can truthfully say that the passenger is breaking the law&#8221;. Earlier in his judgment at para 21, Lewison LJ said that he would &#8220;infer that the Government took the view&#8221; that the guidance which accompanied the amended para 12 of the Conduct Regulations (and set out in para 19 above) &#8220;struck the right balance between the interests of wheelchair users on the one hand, and other passengers on the other&#8221;, and that &#8220;FirstGroup&#8217;s policy follows this Government guidance&#8221;. He fairly added that &#8220;this guidance pre-dated the introduction of the duty to make reasonable adjustments which is now contained in the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref>&#8221;, although as he said &#8220;the guidance has not been withdrawn or amended&#8221;.</p>

As explained above, the Court of Appeal concentrated on the contention that the adjustment which it was said that FirstGroup had wrongly failed to make to its PCP was &#8220;to have a policy of requir[ing] and if necessary enforc[ing]&#8221; the requirement (as Mr Allen QC succinctly put it in his argument on behalf of Mr Paulley), as opposed to merely requesting, that non-wheelchair users vacate the space if the space was needed by a wheelchair user. This proposal involves two departures from FirstGroup&#8217;s PCP: first it involves the driver requiring, rather than requesting, a non-wheelchair user to vacate a space; secondly, in the event of non-compliance, it involves the driver, rather than doing nothing, enforcing the requirement by ejecting the non-wheelchair user (or getting him or her ejected) from the space, and, if necessary, from the bus.</p>

However, for my part, I accept the submission of Mr Chamberlain QC for FirstGroup that the Recorder did hold that such a policy was mandated. I say that for a number of reasons.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">First, the Recorder appears to me to have made it clear when he said that &#8220;a non-disabled passenger &#8230; would either have to vacate the space by, for example, folding a buggy and sitting elsewhere, or by leaving the bus and taking the next bus available&#8221; in the passage quoted in para 79 of Lord Toulson&#8217;s judgment. In addition, the Recorder said that &#8220;the real adjustment alleged on behalf of the claimant&#8221; was that there should be &#8220;a clear practice/policy which not only paid lip service to the giving of priority but actually enforced such priority&#8221;, so that non-wheelchair users would realise that &#8220;if there was competition for [a] space with a wheelchair user they would either have to vacate the space &#8230; or [leave] the bus&#8221;. Consistently with this approach, the Recorder then considered the evidence relating to the possibility of enforcing a requirement to vacate the space on an unwilling non-wheelchair user who was occupying it, and concluded that &#8220;the real adjustment&#8221; which he had identified should have been made by FirstGroup. In addition, there is his reference to any requirement being &#8220;enforced&#8221; in the passage quoted at the beginning of para 30 above.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Thirdly, it is quite clear that the hearing before the Court of Appeal, and the judgment of that court proceeded on the basis that the Recorder had accepted Mr Paulley&#8217;s case, which was that, to be legally valid, any policy should be enforceable, if necessary, by requiring a non-wheelchair user to get off the bus. Lewison LJ said at para 41 of his judgment, &#8220;the arguments on the appeal were limited to the question whether the judge was right to endorse the PCP that he did. There was no Respondent&#8217;s Notice and no argument directed to some alternative and more limited form of PCP that FirstGroup should have adopted.&#8221; (Mr Allen QC makes a fair criticism that the two references to &#8220;PCP&#8221; are mischaracterisations, but it is clear that Lewison LJ meant &#8220;adjustment&#8221; rather than PCP). In particular, Lewison LJ said that Mr Paulley&#8217;s case had involved an amendment to the PCP where &#8220;no discretion is given to the driver&#8221;. And Underhill and Arden LJJ expressed views to the same effect - see the passages quoted from their respective judgments at the end of paras 36 and 37 above. Further, as Mr Chamberlain QC said, the point is also apparent from exchanges during the argument in the Court of Appeal, including that quoted in para 42 above.</p>

He said that at first instance there had been &#8220;no discussion of &#8216;compel[ling] all other passengers to vacate the wheelchair space irrespective of the reason why they are in it&#8217;&#8221;, but, although he contended that FirstGroup did not rely on &#8220;exceptional circumstances&#8221; before the Recorder, Mr Allen nowhere disputed the notion that the Recorder concluded that FirstGroup&#8217;s policy should include mandatory enforcement. It is also clear from later passages in his written case that he accepted that the question of mandatory enforcement was floated in argument before the Recorder. Indeed, in his written case, Mr Allen made the point that FirstGroup could enforce any policy by requiring drivers to turn off the bus a non-wheelchair user who did not move from a space.</p>

First, in so far as this adjustment involved an absolute rule (ie that any non-wheelchair user must vacate the space if it is required by a wheelchair user), it would not be reasonable. Secondly, whether it was an absolute rule or a qualified rule (ie that any non-wheelchair user must vacate if it is reasonable), its implementation through the medium of mandatory enforcement would be likely to lead to problems on some occasions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">As to an absolute rule, it is true that there is nothing in the primary or secondary legislation which supports the notion that the space allocated for wheelchair-users is to be exclusively used by such individuals, although it is clear that that was, in general terms at any rate, the primarily envisaged use. It is also true that there is no absolutist legislative provision comparable to those relating to anti-social activities as contained in the Conduct Regulations set out in paras 15-17 above. However, it does not follow from either point that a court could not conclude that, on appropriate facts, an absolute rule such as that suggested by the Recorder would be requisite. As Mr Allen QC argued, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2010 Act</ref> accorded what Lady Hale has called an &#8220;extra right &#8230; consistent with the obligations which the United Kingdom has now undertaken under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities&#8221; -<span style="font-style:italic"> Aster Communities Ltd (formerly Housing Homes Ltd) v Akerman-Livingstone (Equality and Human Rights Commission intervening)</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2015] AC 1399" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2015">[2015] AC 1399</ref>, paras 25-26. Accordingly, I do not consider that, for instance, para 12(3)(b) of the Conduct Regulations (set out in para 18 above) or the guidance set out in para 19 above provides an automatic answer to the notion that, on appropriate facts, there should be an absolute rule.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Nonetheless, once one considers the effect of an absolute rule in relation to the use of spaces on buses, it is not difficult to conceive of circumstances in which it could be unreasonable to expect a non-wheelchair user to vacate a space and, even more, to get off the bus even though the space is needed by a wheelchair user. As Lewison LJ said (perhaps somewhat optimistically in some cases) in para 48 of his judgment, &#8220;[a]lmost by definition, a person who refuses to vacate the wheelchair space when asked to do so [to accommodate a wheelchair-user] will have a reason which (at least to them) seems to be a reasonable one&#8221;. Thus, it might be reasonable for a person to refuse to vacate the space, if he or she was disabled and needed the space to store disability aids, or was elderly and infirm, or was accompanying infants, especially, for instance, if that person had an urgent hospital appointment, or would find it physically very difficult to alight from the bus. Or the space might be occupied by a vulnerable person who only felt safe in the space and could not reasonably be required to leave the bus in an unfamiliar or unsafe location. Of course, in some of these types of circumstances, it might be possible for the non-wheelchair user to move elsewhere on the bus, but that may be impossible in some cases, or it may only be possible if third parties, not occupying the space, alighted from the bus, which may be unacceptably difficult or even impossible to arrange.</p>

Such an approach is close to what I have called a qualified rule, viz a rule that non-wheelchair users would only be required to vacate a space to accommodate a wheelchair user if it would be unreasonable for them not to do so. I have some doubts whether it would be fair to impose on bus drivers the burden of deciding on the relative needs of a wheelchair user and a non-wheelchair user in circumstances when the decision may result in his requiring the non-wheelchair user to vacate the bus. However, it is unnecessary to decide that point in the light of what I say in the next three paragraphs.</p>

This is particularly relevant given the need to take into account practicability and disruption under para 7.30 of the Code of Practice (para 27 above).</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">As I have already mentioned, a non-wheelchair user who refused to vacate the space, whether requested or required to do so, would often (indeed, I think, would normally) consider that he or she was entitled to refuse, and would often have arguably good, or at least understandable, reasons for the refusal. Further, if the bus was full, enforcement of the request would require someone to get off the bus. It would be bad enough if that involved the practically fraught requirement that the non-wheelchair user who was occupying the space get off the bus; but in some cases, the driver might have to consider whether it would be more appropriate to require one or more third parties to get off, so that, because of her needs, the non-wheelchair user could take their place. Accordingly, any enforcement by a driver of the policy proposed by the primary contention would, possibly frequently, be likely to involve confrontation at best and violence at worst.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Further, it is by no means clear that there is any statutory obligation on a passenger to comply with a policy relating to use of the space. This is in marked contrast with the situations dealt with in paras 5 and 6 of the Conduct Regulations (see paras 15 and 16 above), which impose a duty on a passenger, as well as on the operator and the driver, in relation to what the Recorder accurately described as anti-social behaviour on the part of the passenger. Further, in para 8, those Regulations provide for enforcement by the driver, and where appropriate by the police (see para 17 above). I note what Lady Hale and Lord Kerr say about para 6(1)(b) of the Conduct Regulations. I do not see how it could on any view be relied on if a non-wheelchair user was required to get off the bus: reading paras 6(1)(b) and 12(3)(b) together, the most that a driver can require of such a person is that she move elsewhere in the bus. Quite apart from this, I am by no means convinced that a non-wheelchair user who unreasonably failed to comply with a request to move from the space would fall foul of para 6(1)(b). Para 12 imposes duties on a driver, not on a passenger, whereas para 6 is concerned with the behaviour of passengers. And para 6(1)(b) has a requirement of reasonableness, and, as mentioned in para 48 above, most non-wheelchair users who refuse to vacate a space will believe that they are being reasonable. And, in any event, even if para 6(1)(b) did apply, it would not answer the points made in paras 50-51 above.</p>

Again, I find it impossible to accept that a policy would not be held to be reasonable unless it required a driver to stop the bus until a non-wheelchair user vacated a space. It would be plainly unfair on the other passengers, particularly in a full bus or in a bus which was connecting with another service (eg a train or another bus), if the driver had to wait for a long time. Indeed, it is not fanciful to think that such a policy could lead to violence. As Buxton LJ said in <span style="font-style:italic">Roads v Central Trains Ltd</span> (2004) 104 Con LR 62, para 42, &#8220;[s]teps might be unreasonable for a [service provider] to take if they unreasonably impact on third parties&#8221;.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is true that stopping the bus until a passenger ceased any anti-social behaviour was, on the evidence of Mr Britcliffe, a course which a driver occasionally adopted where a passenger persisted in a breach of para 6 of the Conduct Regulations. But it does not follow that it would therefore be reasonable to expect a driver to take the same course in every case where a non-wheelchair user refuses to vacate a space needed by a wheelchair user, and may have to leave the bus if he does vacate the space. In a case involving anti-social behaviour, there would rarely if ever be a need for a difficult decision about competing needs, and the nature of any confrontation would be likely to be very different from that in a case involving competing claims to occupy the space. Mr Britcliffe made the point in his evidence when he said that &#8220;there&#8217;s a lot of difference between a kebab and a new-born baby, I&#8217;m afraid&#8221;. Further, subject to the possible argument as to the applicability of para 6(1)(b) of the Conduct Regulations, in a case involving anti-social behaviour, the police could be called under para 8 of the Conduct Regulations, whereas there is no such provision applicable to a case where a non-wheelchair user refuses to vacate a space required by a wheelchair-user.</p>

Mr Paulley&#8217;s alternative contention (&#8220;the alternative contention&#8221;) is that, even if one rejects his primary contention, FirstGroup should still have adjusted its PCP so that it expressed itself more prescriptively in writing through the Notice and/or orally through the driver.</p>

It is also contended that Mr Britcliffe, the driver of the Bus, should have told the woman occupying the space that she had to vacate it now that Mr Paulley required it, and that Mr Britcliffe should have refused to drive on, at least for a period, if she did not comply. It is further contended that there was no good reason why FirstGroup could not have adopted such a policy with regard to its notices and its instructions to its drivers. The fact that such written and oral requirements would not be enforced by drivers or the police does not, it is argued, alter the fact that if such stipulations were expressed as requirements, rather than as requests, it is substantially more likely that any non-wheelchair user would vacate the space if it was needed by a wheelchair user.</p>

They said that the only adjustment with which this case was concerned was that identified in paras 11 and 14 above, namely what I have called the principal contention, viz that, rather than simply requesting, FirstGroup should have required, and enforced the requirement, that persons not in wheelchairs vacate the space when it was needed by a person in a wheelchair.</p>

Those alleged adjustments included the primary contention (ie forcing a recalcitrant non-wheelchair user to leave the bus), but they also included a number of alternative contentions including (i) a more peremptory Notice, (ii) the driver insisting that the pushchair was folded and (iii) the driver refusing to move on until the space was vacated (as well as other suggestions). The Recorder referred to the various suggested adjustments in his well-constructed and clear judgment, but, as explained in para 42 above described &#8220;the real adjustment alleged on behalf of the claimant&#8221; as requiring and enforcing - ie Mr Paulley&#8217;s primary case - which he went on to accept.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In these circumstances, there are two possible problems with this Court considering Mr Paulley&#8217;s alternative contention. First, it seems quite clear that the argument and judgments in the Court of Appeal proceeded on the basis that it was not part of Mr Paulley&#8217;s case, as seems to have been accepted on his behalf. On the other hand, the case was advanced much more broadly before the Recorder, because, as I have explained, a number of possible adjustments were put forward on the basis that they were alternatives or cumulative. Nonetheless, because of the position adopted on behalf of Mr Paulley in the Court of Appeal, it can be said to be rather unsatisfactory for this Court to consider whether FirstGroup should have made an adjustment to its PCP which was less extreme than that found by the Recorder.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The second problem arises from the fact that, in order for Mr Paulley to succeed in his claim, he must not only establish that FirstGroup should have made an adjustment to its PCP, but also that, had that adjustment been made, there is at least a real prospect that it would have made a difference. (It is right to say that decisions of the Employment Appeal Tribunal express the &#8220;real prospect&#8221; test slightly differently (compare <span style="font-style:italic">Lancaster v TBWA Manchester</span>UKEAT/0460/10/DA, para 46 and <span style="font-style:italic">Leeds Teaching Hospital NHS v Foster</span>UKEAT/052/10, para 17). However, the precise formulation of the test is not relevant for present purposes. The essential point is that there is no finding by the Recorder that, if FirstGroup had phrased the Notice more peremptorily and/or required its drivers to be more forceful, this requirement would have been satisfied, given that there would have been no question of actual enforcement. In particular, as Lord Toulson points out in para 85 below, there has been no formal appeal and no written or oral argument against the finding that the woman occupying the space refused to move after saying that her pushchair did not fold down. There is therefore no satisfactory basis upon which this Court can, in fairness to FirstGroup, conclude that there would have been a real prospect that such an adjustment to its PCP would have resulted in Mr Paulley not being placed in the disadvantage that he was.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In my judgment, the solution which enables this Court both to be procedurally fair to the parties and to provide as much guidance as possible in this important field, is to decide whether the alternative contention should, on the evidence given to the Recorder and findings made by him, succeed but, in the event of our so deciding not to award Mr Paulley any damages. The evidence and arguments in relation to the alternative contention were advanced before the Recorder, and, by accepting Mr Paulley&#8217;s more extreme primary contention, it is very likely that he must or would have decided to reject FirstGroup&#8217;s arguments against the alternative. Although the alternative contention was not advanced in the Court of Appeal, we have the benefit of some valuable thoughts on it from Underhill and Arden LJJ. Accordingly, the fact that a case based on the alternative contention was not run in the Court of Appeal should not be fatal to Mr Paulley&#8217;s ability to run it before this Court. On the other hand, to award Mr Paulley any damages in the event of this Court accepting the alternative contention would be unwarranted as the Recorder made no finding as to whether he would have been disadvantaged had the PCP been adjusted accordingly. (The first instance finding that Mr Paulley was disadvantaged was based on the Recorder&#8217;s view as to what FirstGroup&#8217;s policy should have been, which, for the reasons which I have attempted to give, was too prescriptive.) It is true that this approach would make any finding as to the alternative contention somewhat hypothetical, and indeed arguably obiter, but that should not, in my opinion, stand in the way of our addressing it.</p>

The first is that the Notice should have been more strongly expressed and that it should have stated that the obligation to vacate the space, if needed by a wheelchair user, would be enforced. The second component is that FirstGroup&#8217;s bus drivers should have been required to do more than simply ask a non-wheelchair user occupying the space to vacate if it was needed by a wheelchair user, in particular they should positively have expressed themselves as requiring the non-wheelchair user to vacate the space and/or they should have refused to drive on until she did so.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">As mentioned above, the space in the Bus contained a wheelchair sign, as specifically required by the Accessibility Regulations, and it also contained the Notice when no such notice was specifically required by those (or any other) Regulations (see paras 3 and 12 above). I do not consider that FirstGroup can be criticised for not expressing the Notice in more peremptory terms. In disagreement with the Recorder, it seems to me that, albeit politely, the Notice did require, rather than merely request, a non-wheelchair user to vacate the space if it was needed by a wheelchair user. Without the word &#8220;Please&#8221; it was a requirement, and the addition of the word &#8220;Please&#8221; at best makes it more polite and at worst softens the requirement. Secondly, there is no reason to doubt the evidence of Mr Birtwhistle, FirstGroup&#8217;s manager, who said that the company had been advised that &#8220;directive&#8221; notices were a less effective means of communication with the public than more &#8220;customer friendly&#8221; and &#8220;non-confrontational&#8221; notices. (It is right to mention that there was evidence that some other bus companies used more peremptory notices, but there was no evidence to suggest that they were more effective). Thirdly, while I would not endorse it as a principle applicable in all cases, Underhill LJ&#8217;s statement at para 68 of his judgment that &#8220;[l]egal liability ought not to depend on whether an employer has chosen to use specially emphatic language in expressing his policy&#8221; has real force in relation to criticisms of the way the Notice was expressed. If finding a more peremptory, persuasive or firmly worded notice in another company&#8217;s buses was enough to undermine the reasonableness of the notice in this case, it could, as a matter of logic, lead to an absurd state of affairs - the fact that another bus company used more aggressive language, a larger sign, bolder print, or more exclamation marks could presumably all be relied on. And it is worth remembering that we are concerned with the question whether FirstGroup&#8217;s PCP makes &#8220;reasonable adjustments&#8221;, and, as is made clear by the Code of Practice, that involves taking practicality into account.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Recorder also thought that the Notice should have made it clear that the priority of wheelchair users over the space &#8220;would be enforced&#8221;. While that view has its attractions, I am ultimately not convinced by it. First, having rejected Mr Paulley&#8217;s primary case (unlike the Recorder), I am unenthusiastic about the notion of a court requiring a party to put up a notice containing a statement which would not be true - and it would not be true once one rejects Mr Paulley&#8217;s primary case. Secondly, as I have already indicated, in the light of Mr Birtwhistle&#8217;s evidence as to what constituted effective notices, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I would not be prepared to hold that FirstGroup was in breach of its duty to make reasonable adjustments by failing to express the Notice more aggressively.

On this aspect, it seems to me that there is obvious force in the concerns, expressed by Underhill LJ in the second passage quoted from his judgment in para 36 above, about the difficulties of identifying any policy given the fact that the circumstances of the non-wheelchair user and the character of the driver could be very different in different cases.</p>

I accept that allowance must be made for the fact that there will be a variety of different circumstances in which a non-wheelchair user refuses to vacate a space which is needed by a wheelchair user. Thus, the appropriate approach of the driver could depend on (i) the reason for the refusal, including, in particular, the needs of the non-wheelchair user; (ii) the surrounding circumstances, including whether the bus is full or has vacant places, whether the bus is on time, and the frequency of the service; and (possibly) (iii) the character of the driver. However, in para 68 of his judgment, Underhill LJ was in my view right in describing as &#8220;good practice&#8221;, &#8220;a policy &#8230; to encourage drivers to go as far as they thought appropriate in the circumstances - in legal language, &#8216;use their best endeavours&#8217; - to induce the recalcitrant passenger to reconsider his or her initial refusal&#8221;.</p>

If the driver considers that that is so, or even probably so, then it would not, at least normally, be unreasonable for any request to move not to be taken further. However, where the driver concludes that the non-wheelchair user&#8217;s refusal is unreasonable, it seems to me that it would be unjustifiable for a bus-operating company to have a policy which does not require some further step of the bus driver in any circumstances. In particular, where there is some other place on the bus to which a non-wheelchair user could move, I cannot see why a driver should not be expected to rephrase any polite request as a requirement, and, if that does not work and especially if the bus is ahead of schedule, why the driver should not be expected to consider whether there was any reason why the bus should not stop for a few minutes with a view to pressurising or shaming the recalcitrant non-wheelchair user to move.</p>

It may well be, as Underhill LJ went on to say, that, at least in many cases, &#8220;there is in reality no very deep gulf between a policy so expressed and one, like FirstGroup&#8217;s, which does not in terms go further than saying that the passenger should be asked to move&#8221;. However, in my opinion, there will undoubtedly be cases where the sort of &#8220;good practice&#8221; which he suggested, and which I have attempted to summarise in para 67 above, could be expected to produce positive results whereas FirstGroup&#8217;s current, more pallid, policy would not do so. When a non-wheelchair user is unreasonably refusing to move from the space, there are vacant places on the bus, (and the bus is ahead of schedule) a more forceful repetition of an initial unsuccessful request in the form of a requirement (coupled with a refusal to drive on for several minutes) may well persuade the unreasonable non-wheelchair user to vacate the space.</p>

I therefore find it hard to see how it could be unreasonable to expect FirstGroup to train its drivers to do a bit more, when appropriate, if and when an initial request is not complied with. I also agree with Lord Toulson that this conclusion is supported by para 12(2) and (3) of the Conduct Regulations (set out in para 18 above), which show that those responsible for those Regulations did not consider it unreasonable to decide whether a non-wheelchair user could &#8220;readily and reasonably vacate&#8221; a space and &#8220;mov[e] to another part of the vehicle&#8221;. Such a conclusion seems to me to be consistent with what Underhill LJ &#8220;hope[d] and expect[ed]&#8221; in the first passage quoted in para 36 above, and what Arden LJ considered that FirstGroup should do in the passage quoted in para 37 above.</p>

As to that, I accept that we could decide this appeal without expressing a view as to how much further FirstGroup&#8217;s PCP should have gone - for instance, without deciding whether a requirement to move would have to be physically enforced. However, that would, in my opinion, be regrettable. Merely to decide that FirstGroup&#8217;s PCP fails to satisfy the requirements of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2010 Act</ref> would leave bus companies in a state of real uncertainty as to their equality duties in connection with wheelchair users. It is inevitable that any decision we reach will result in some grey areas, but it is one of the principal functions of this Court to clarify the law, and therefore to keep the grey areas as few and as small as possible.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">As to Lord Sumption&#8217;s judgment, I agree with him that, at least as a general rule, the law should not normally seek to sanction or otherwise deal with lawful but inconsiderate behaviour, and, similarly, it should not normally enforce basic standards of decency and courtesy. However, we are here concerned with a statute whose purpose is to ensure, within limits, that behaviour is curbed when it results in discrimination under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/29" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 29</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref>. Accordingly, while it is essential that any judicial decision in this area seeks to take into account the realities of life and the interests of others, judges have to do their best to give effect to that purpose, even if it may involve a degree of departure from the general rule.</p>

There is therefore an apparent tension in the regulation, because regulation 12(2) requires the driver to permit a wheelchair user to board if there is an unoccupied wheelchair space, which includes a space physically occupied by a person who could readily and reasonably move elsewhere, but for as long as that person remains in the wheelchair space the vehicle must not be driven. Where the space is taken by someone who could readily and reasonably vacate it by moving to another part of the bus, the driver could properly say to that person that he, the driver, is required by law to allow the wheelchair user to occupy the space and that for this to happen that person must move. But there is a possibility that he may be ignored. I would in such circumstances interpret the obligation under regulation 12(2) as an obligation on the driver to do as much as he practically can to enable a wheelchair user to occupy the wheelchair space, unless it is already occupied within the meaning of regulation 12(3), but if that task proves impossible he is not required to do more.</p>

Once such a practice was put into effect with a proper system of notices, warnings and, if necessary, advertising then the culture will have changed and no non-disabled passenger who wished to occupy the space could be under any illusion that if there was competition for such a space with a wheelchair user, then they would either have to vacate the space by, for example, folding a buggy and sitting elsewhere, or by leaving the bus and taking the next bus available.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">However, more importantly than debating what precisely the Recorder meant in his full and careful judgment, the case has raised points on which those who are affected need a clear ruling from this Court. They include not only the question whether the bus company should reasonably have adopted a general practice of requiring other passengers to allow the wheelchair space to be occupied by a wheelchair user, but also the question whether that should apply even if it would mean requiring the other passenger(s) to get off the bus. On the latter point, I agree with the Court of Appeal that the Recorder went too far. The risk that a bus may be fully occupied when it arrives at a bus stop is one shared by all travellers. The risk may be greater for wheelchair users because there is likely to be only one wheelchair space, but if that space is occupied within the meaning of regulation 12(3) of the Conduct Regulations, I do not see that it would be reasonable to require the occupier to leave the bus midway through their journey. By definition we are talking about someone who is already lawfully on the bus and who cannot &#8220;readily and reasonably vacate [the wheelchair space] by moving to another part of the bus.&#8221; Moreover the person may also have protected characteristics, such as having a disability requiring the use of a walking frame or being a child. As Lady Hale has demonstrated, 90% of people with disabilities do not use wheelchairs, and the evidence is that over half of those with disabilities have mobility problems, no doubt of varying severity. Age is another protected characteristic, and there would be obvious objections to a policy which entailed telling a child that he or she was required to get off the bus, even more so if it were at an unfamiliar or unsafe location or after dark or for a lengthy or uncertain period of time. Illustrations of passengers with particularly cogent reasons to object to being told that they were required to leave the bus could readily be multiplied. If the law in this difficult and sensitive area becomes the subject of further Parliamentary consideration (to which I refer at the end of this judgment), there would doubtless be considerable argument about striking a fair balance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The situation is different if the space is occupied by somebody who could readily and reasonably vacate it but refuses to do so. There is a preliminary objection that a bus driver cannot reasonably be expected to judge whether a person could readily and reasonably vacate the space, but I do not regard that as a point of substance. It is easy to make it sound complicated, but realistically it should not be difficult to tell whether there is another part of the bus which the person could readily and reasonably use. The drafter of regulation 12(2) and (3) must have presupposed that this would not be too much for a bus driver or conductor, and the bus company&#8217;s own policy, set out by Lord Neuberger at para 8, expected the driver to be able to tell if other space on the bus was available for a non-wheelchair user who was occupying the wheelchair area (&#8220;If this is occupied with a buggy, standing passengers or otherwise full, and there is space elsewhere on the vehicle, the driver will ask that it is made free for a wheelchair user&#8221;). It is a matter of looking.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I agree with Lord Neuberger that there are reasonable steps which a bus company could take beyond simply asking the occupant to move. The driver could make it plain that it is a requirement and I do not see that it would be misleading or wrong for him to do so. For one thing, if the place is taken by someone who could readily and reasonably vacate it by moving to another available space, the object of the duty placed on the driver by regulation 12(2) and (3) is to enable the wheelchair user to occupy it and in those circumstances it must be at least open to the bus company to stipulate that the non-wheelchair user who could readily and reasonably vacate it should do so. But in any event I am not aware of a legal principle which prevents a service provider from adopting a requirement just because securing compliance with it will or may depend on moral pressure. Unless the bus is running late, the driver could also wait at least for a time for the passenger to comply. The policy might not succeed in every case, and in that event the driver might have no practical alternative to refusing to allow the wheelchair user to remain on the bus, but the fact that the policy might not work in every case does not make it valueless. The concept of &#8220;reasonable adjustments&#8221; under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/29/7" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 29(7)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref> is intensely practical.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In the present case there was no finding of fact by the Recorder whether the lady with the child in a buggy could reasonably and readily have vacated the wheelchair space. Lewison LJ said in his account of the facts that the driver asked her to move and to fold down her pushchair so that the claimant could use the space, but that she said that her pushchair did not fold down and refused to move. There was no appeal against that finding. Because it was not an issue in the appeal, the court heard no argument whether Lewison LJ&#8217;s account was correct or incorrect, but I note that it was consistent with the claimant&#8217;s own witness statement. It would not be right in these circumstances for this Court to substitute a contrary finding, and I do not consider that the case merits being remitted to the judge for further consideration. It follows that the award of damages in favour of the claimant cannot be sustained, but, like Lord Neuberger, I would allow the appeal to the extent of holding that the bus company ought to have adopted a policy of training its staff to make clear, in circumstances where a wheelchair user wanted to board the bus but the wheelchair space was occupied by somebody who could reasonably and readily move to another part of the bus, that the person occupying it must do so.</p>

But the law cannot enforce basic decency and courtesy, save insofar as they correspond to legal standards of behaviour. The difficulty in this case is that the Conduct Regulations deal with the obligations of passengers at paras 5 and 6, without imposing any obligation on them to vacate the wheelchair space when it is required by a wheelchair user. FirstGroup cannot create such an obligation of passengers by the terms of their published wheelchair policy. I agree with Lord Neuberger that in those circumstances it would be wrong to expect the bus company to rephrase the notice at the designated wheelchair space so as to suggest that a non-wheelchair user was required to move. It would simply not be true. The difficulty is that the same objection might be said to apply to Lord Neuberger&#8217;s view that the driver&#8217;s polite request having been rejected, he should rephrase it as a requirement. That would not be true either.</p>

They would then have a contractual right to enforce a requirement by the driver to move. The difficulties about this solution are (i) that it will not in all cases be reasonable to require the non-wheelchair user to vacate the wheelchair space, even if there is space elsewhere on the bus; (ii) it would not in my view be reasonable in any case to require him or her to get off the bus if there is no space elsewhere; and (iii) a change in the conditions of carriage which were subject to a test of reasonableness in each case would simply give rise to argument with the more recalcitrant non-wheelchair users, without being enforceable at the only point of time when enforcement would of be any use to wheelchair users.</p>

In the absence of such a change, we must recognise that there are limits to what law can achieve in amending lawful but inconsiderate behaviour.

But this is not a case in which it would be right to dissent. In a situation where there is no ideal solution, but only more or less unsatisfactory ones, I think that the approach of Lord Neuberger and Lord Toulson comes as close to giving effect to the policy of this legislation as a court legitimately can. I therefore agree with their proposed disposition of this difficult appeal. In particular I agree with them that once one rejects, as I fear one must, the more abrasive policy required by the Recorder, there are no findings which could justify an award of damages.</p>

Thus, drivers, inspectors and conductors are prohibited from preventing a disabled person accompanied by an assistance, guide or hearing dog being allowed to board and travel in the vehicle with his dog, subject to there being a suitable space available (regulation 5(7)); likewise, drivers and conductors are required to allow a wheelchair user to board if there is an unoccupied wheelchair space on the vehicle and to ensure that wheelchair users can gain access into and get out of a wheelchair space (regulation 12(2), (4)); a wheelchair space is occupied if (a) there is a wheelchair user in that space; or (b) passengers or their effects are in that space and they or their effects cannot readily and reasonably vacate it by moving to another part of the vehicle (regulation 12(3)).</p>

Any passenger who is reasonably suspected of contravening any of the regulations is required to give his name and address to the driver, inspector or conductor on demand (regulation 8(1)); and any passenger who actually contravenes the regulations may be removed from the vehicle by the driver, inspector or conductor, or, at their request, by a police constable (regulation 8(2)).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Three general points can be made about the legislative framework which is now in place. The first is that mere compliance with the earlier regulations, both as to the provision of the wheelchair space and affording access to it, is not necessarily enough. Parliament must have contemplated, in passing <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/13" uk:canonical="2005 c. 13" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2005 Act</ref>, that other adjustments to &#8220;business as usual&#8221; might be needed in order to reduce the difficulties faced by disabled people in using public transport services. The second is that, as the Recorder pointed out, &#8220;there is an enormous difference between imposing a criminal sanction upon a driver and the obligation upon a service provider not to discriminate by a failure to take reasonable steps to adjust a present policy which is having the effect of substantially disadvantaging a disabled person&#8221; (para 18). The third, and most obvious, is that service providers owe positive duties towards disabled people, including wheelchair users, which they do not owe to other members of the travelling public, including parents travelling with small children in baby buggies or other people travelling with bulky luggage. The Court of Appeal, in my view, fell into the trap of assuming that the claims of disabled travellers were no different from the claims of any other person wishing to use the buses. They are not. Disabled people are, for very good reasons, a special case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is now not in dispute that the respondent had a provision, criterion or practice which put wheelchair users at a substantial disadvantage when compared with non-disabled passengers. This was their policy of making the wheelchair space provided on their buses available on a &#8220;first come, first served&#8221; basis and doing no more than request occupants to vacate the space if it was required by a wheelchair-using passenger. At the time of the incident in question, the policy was that wheelchair users had no priority over buggies and this infected both the content of the notices and the approach to enforcement. The issue agreed between the parties for the purpose of this appeal is a simple one: &#8220;Was the Recorder correct in concluding that FirstGroup was in breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2010 Act</ref>?&#8221;</p>

It should have been made clear to passengers, and to their drivers, that wheelchair users had priority over anyone else in the occupation of the wheelchair space and that other passengers would be required, not merely requested, to move out of it if a wheelchair user needed it. With a proper system of notices, making the position plain, backed up with firm statements from the driver, everyone would know where they stood. The culture would change. Disruption and confrontation would be unlikely.</p>

Below this there is another heading: &#8220;Priority wheelchair area&#8221; and below this, &#8220;This space is reserved for a wheelchair when needed&#8221;. It goes on to explain how the wheelchair must be placed and ends &#8220;Please give up this space for a wheelchair&#8221;. Alongside this is another panel, headed &#8220;Baby buggies&#8221;. This reads &#8220;Buggies can use this area if it is not needed by a wheelchair user. Please move out of the wheelchair priority area if necessary. Buggies may need to be folded at busy times.&#8221; This may not go quite as far as the Recorder contemplated, but it is clear, polite and firm and a great improvement on the &#8220;Please give up this space for a wheelchair&#8221; sign adopted by the respondent.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Three sorts of objection have been raised to the Recorder&#8217;s conclusion. One is that &#8220;management had undertaken a review of the way in which the company communicated with its passengers. They had been told that they were being too directive so the approach was changed to one which was more &#8216;customer friendly&#8217;. The sign was intended to be non-confrontational&#8221; (para 7 of the Recorder&#8217;s judgment). But that was merely the explanation given by the company for the current sign. The evidence of Mr Birtwhistle, for the company, was that &#8220;there was no reason why the signs which were in the form of a request could not be worded differently so as to make it clear to all passengers that wheelchair users not only had such priority but that that such priority would be enforced&#8221; (para 19 of the Recorder&#8217;s judgment). So he clearly did not consider the non-confrontational practice to be an objection. In any event, it is usually possible to be polite as well as clear and firm. And if clarity and firmness cannot be achieved without a more peremptory tone, then it is reasonable to expect a more peremptory tone. The point has to be got across that other people are required to vacate the wheelchair space if it is needed by a wheelchair user.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The second sort of objection is that there will be some circumstances in which it is not reasonable to expect an existing occupier to vacate the wheelchair space. This is so, although it is important to bear in mind that non-disabled people are not entitled to be treated in the same way as disabled people. There is no duty to make reasonable adjustments for them. There may be circumstances in which that duty, coming as it does after the Conduct Regulations, could go beyond what is required by regulation 12(2) and (3). However, the adjustments to be expected for disabled people must be reasonable ones, and there will obviously be circumstances in which it is not reasonable to expect the space to be vacated. There is nothing in the Recorder&#8217;s judgment to suggest that he was expecting an absolute rule of the sort that would brook no exceptions. This may well be because this sort of objection was not raised before him, although it featured heavily in the Court of Appeal. As already mentioned, the Recorder drew a clear distinction between the criminal liability of drivers under the Regulations and the provider&#8217;s duty to make reasonable adjustments.</p>

Hence a great deal of argument was directed towards how a priority policy might be enforced against recalcitrant passengers. In my view this is something of a red herring. Most people do what they are told to do if they are told sufficiently clearly what it is that they are required to do. The possibility that some people will be disobedient should not deter the bus company from making it clear what the rules are and doing its best to persuade people to obey. There are many steps short of physically removing the person from the bus which can be taken, including delaying the departure of the bus until the rule is obeyed (which I have observed being highly effective against rowdy behaviour on an underground train). I do not read the Recorder&#8217;s references to enforcement as necessarily involving forcible ejection from the space or the bus.</p>

It is also difficult to see why the Recorder was wrong to say that the company could make the requirement to leave the space a term of its conditions of carriage, in breach of which a passenger could be required to leave the bus. This is no more unreasonable than requiring passengers to refrain from eating messy or smelly foods or drinking alcohol. Drivers are frequently required to make judgments of this kind and do their best to enforce them. These points do not have to be decided for the purpose of deciding this case, but I agree with what Lord Kerr says about them in paras 123 to 128 of his judgment.</p>

That being so, I have difficulty in understanding how it can possibly be just to deprive Mr Paulley of the damages which the Recorder awarded him. A variety of adjustments were canvassed before the Recorder and I agree with Lord Kerr (para 133) that his judgment did not partake of the absolute quality which the Court of Appeal thought that it did. Even if it did, it should have been open to Mr Paulley to argue that lesser adjustments were appropriate. He did not need to put in a respondent&#8217;s notice in order to do so. And the sole issue for this Court is not whether the Recorder was correct in every particular, although I am inclined to think that he was, but whether he was correct to find that FirstGroup was in breach. The view of this Court is that FirstGroup was in breach.</p>

This appeal therefore centres on the question of what reasonable adjustments were required to modify the PCP. The Recorder considered that two types of adjustment to deal with the deficiencies in the PCP were entirely feasible. First, the notice on the respondent&#8217;s buses could be changed to make it clear that a non-disabled passenger was obliged to move from a wheelchair space if it was needed by a wheelchair user. Secondly, passengers who failed to vacate the space when asked to do so, could be asked to leave the bus. The Court of Appeal considered that these went further than was reasonable. Lord Neuberger and Lord Toulson agree. Unlike the Court of Appeal, however, they consider that adjustments which can properly be described as reasonable could be made to the respondent&#8217;s PCP. These adjustments are quite different from those deemed by the Recorder to be reasonable.</p>

In short summary, these are: (a) that it would be objectionable to require people to vacate the space whose refusal to do so was reasonable; (b) that it was impracticable to expect the driver to decide whether a passenger was being unreasonable in refusing to move; (c) that it was not feasible to expect a driver to remove such a person or wait for police to arrive and, in any event, police could not enforce the adjusted policy because someone who refused a direction to move would not have committed a criminal offence; and (d) that a more prescriptive notice on the bus was not realistic in light of research which suggested that better results would be achieved by a &#8220;more customer-friendly&#8221; message.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Lord Neuberger takes the view that what he describes as &#8220;an absolute rule&#8221; of requiring a non-wheelchair user to vacate the wheelchair space and, in the event of non-compliance, ejecting the passenger from the space must be rejected (paras 40 and 41). He accepts that establishing an absolute rule is not necessarily inconsistent with a wheelchair user&#8217;s rights under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref> (para 41). But he concludes that the enforcement of an absolute rule would not be reasonable in all conceivable circumstances. So, for instance, a person who was disabled but who did not require the use of a wheelchair might reasonably refuse to move from the wheelchair space. Likewise, a person who felt safe only in that space and who might otherwise be vulnerable could not reasonably be required to leave it.</p>

He expresses doubt as to the fairness of requiring a bus driver to assess whether an objection to vacate the wheelchair space is reasonable. Whatever of that, however, Lord Neuberger considers that the clinching argument is that enforcement of a rule that required a passenger to vacate the wheelchair space on the basis of an absolute or a qualified rule would involve unacceptable confrontation and, on that account, could not be regarded as a reasonable adjustment to the PCP.</p>

This involved the consideration of &#8220;a number of potential reasonable adjustments&#8221;. They included a more peremptory notice on the buses; the driver insisting that a pushchair be folded so as to accommodate the wheelchair; and the driver refusing to continue the journey until the space was vacated. Lord Neuberger has taken the view that consideration of these alternative formulations was beset by two procedural problems. The first was that the Court of Appeal had proceeded on the basis that the appellant&#8217;s case was confined to the &#8220;absolute&#8221; argument <span style="font-style:italic">viz </span>that a non-wheelchair user should be required to vacate the wheelchair space and, in the event of non-compliance, they should be ejected from the bus. The second procedural difficulty identified by Lord Neuberger was the absence of any finding by the Recorder that, if one of these modified adjustments had been made, there was a real prospect that it would have made a difference.</p>

He has concluded that it was not enough for the respondent to instruct its drivers to request non-wheelchair users to vacate the space and do nothing further if that request was not acted upon (para 59). Various courses of action that a driver might take are adumbrated by Lord Neuberger at para 60.</p>

Here the context is the elimination of discrimination against disabled people. That will require, in appropriate circumstances, able-bodied people to accept restrictions that they may find irksome or inconvenient. It will demand of those who police or enforce the adjustments that they be ready to make difficult decisions and that they be prepared to confront and require of those who may not wish to, to suppress selfish inclinations. Moreover, difficulty in enforcement of those restrictions does not automatically determine that they are unreasonable. There is a distinct exhortatory dimension to be recognised in deciding whether an adjustment to assist a disabled person to overcome the disadvantage that she or he has in comparison to an able-bodied person is reasonable.</p>

Mr Birtwhistle explained that the reason for the signs being by way of request rather than requirement was that the management had undertaken a review of the way in which the company communicated with its passengers. They had been told that they were being too directive so the approach was changed to one which was more &#8216;customer friendly&#8217;. The sign was intended to be non-confrontational.&#8221;</p>

It may well be the case that customer relations might be improved if a less confrontational sign was erected but this is not a case about fostering good customer relations, at least not unless the better relations would assist in eliminating the discrimination that wheelchair users suffer in using the respondent&#8217;s buses. Lewison LJ said that negative prescriptive signage would produce a &#8220;worse outcome&#8221; but it is not clear on what basis this was anticipated. Is it suggested that non-disabled customers were less likely to comply with a requirement to vacate the wheelchair space than they would to a request to do so? Such a conclusion is certainly not warranted by the Recorder&#8217;s account of Mr Birtwhistle&#8217;s evidence on the subject.</p>

Customers may baulk at direct instructions but they cannot claim that they are entitled to exercise a choice in the matter. A bus company which alerts its passengers that they will have to abide by certain rules if they wish to travel removes the element of choice or the occasion for discussion. This may not be conducive to the best customer relations but it makes it clear that certain rules must be obeyed if the customer is to avail of the company&#8217;s services. A reasonable adjustment geared to removing discrimination against wheelchair users cannot be discounted simply because a less rigorous policy might promote good customer relations.</p>

Viewed in that way, the answer is plain. It is an entirely reasonable adjustment. It removes the element of choice on the part of the passenger occupying the space. They know, and, importantly, know in advance, that they will have to move. Some passengers may not like it but that is not the point. Such a notice, as well as eliminating any scope for debate, constitutes a significant statement which accords precisely with the Government&#8217;s policy of providing comprehensive and enforceable civil rights for disabled people and achieving a fully accessible public transport system for them - see para 19 of Lord Neuberger&#8217;s judgment.</p>

And since it would not involve the driver making assessments which are markedly different from those which he is already required to undertake by virtue of regulations 6 and 8, it cannot be suggested that such an adjustment was other than reasonable.</p>

But these considerations do not detract from the reasonableness of an adjustment to the PCP whereby the driver is at least entitled to say to a passenger, &#8220;you have to move&#8221;. If the passenger persists in refusal, the driver may decide not to proceed with the journey. This would of course inconvenience other passengers and it might well lead to unpleasantness but these are not reasons to condemn as unreasonable a change to the PCP which gives drivers the responsibility of pointing out to a passenger obstinately refusing to move that it is the policy of the bus company (and, when the adjustment to them had been made, one of the conditions of carriage) that they must vacate the wheelchair space.</p>

I do not read the Recorder&#8217;s judgment as requiring that the reasonable adjustment must incorporate the need to eject a passenger refusing to move. In para 13 of his judgment he outlined the various adjustments which the appellant had initially put forward as reasonable modifications that could be made to the company&#8217;s PCP. None of these suggested that passengers who refused to move would have to be ejected. To the contrary, one suggestion was that the driver should try to persuade the passenger to move; another was that the driver should refuse to continue the journey until the passenger moved from the wheelchair space. These are not consistent with a proposal that the driver be required to eject him. At para 15 the Recorder said that it had become apparent during the hearing that the &#8220;real adjustment&#8221; which the appellant sought was &#8220;a clear practice/policy which not only paid lip service to the giving of priority to the wheelchair user but actually enforced such priority&#8221;.

Once such a practice was put into effect with a proper system of notices, warnings and, if necessary, advertising then the culture will have changed and no non-disabled passenger who wished to occupy the space could be under any illusion that if there was a competition for such a space with a wheelchair user, then they would either have to vacate the space by, for example, folding a buggy and sitting elsewhere, or by leaving the bus and taking the next bus available. The extent to which the adoption of such a policy would also require an insistence that pushchairs be folded or that passengers should be asked to fold their buggies before boarding the bus or that drivers should be trained to enable them to better persuade passengers to move from the wheelchair area would be a matter of degree.

Ensuring that a passenger was under no illusion as to what was expected of him or her is quite a different matter from physically removing them from the bus against their will if they failed to meet that expectation. Nor do I understand him to have suggested that passengers should in every case be required to vacate the wheelchair space, regardless of whether they were able to do so reasonably. The Recorder articulated a reasonable adjustment designed to cover, among other circumstances, the case of a passenger who occupied a space with what she claimed was a buggy that would not fold. It was never suggested that there was nowhere else on the bus for the passenger to sit. The problem was, if her claim was true, where the buggy should be placed. The necessary inference from the Recorder&#8217;s judgment was that, if the passenger was unable to fold the buggy and to store it somewhere away from the wheelchair space, it was reasonable to expect her to be asked to leave the bus in order that Mr Paulley could be allowed to board. This, I suggest, is clear from para 15 of the Recorder&#8217;s judgment where he said that, &#8220;if there was competition for such a space with a wheelchair user, then they would either have to vacate the space by, <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">for example,</span> folding a buggy and sitting elsewhere, or <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">by leaving the bus</span> and taking the next bus available.&#8221;</p>

The notice would give emphasis to the policy of the company that it is expected that able-bodied passengers must yield the space to a wheelchair user. There is no reason to suppose that drivers making that policy explicitly clear would not help to persuade reluctant passengers that it is pointless to refuse. There is every difference between a passenger who says &#8220;well, your policy allows me to refuse a request and I am refusing&#8221; and the passenger who says, &#8220;well, I know that your policy requires me to move but I am not moving.&#8221; Even without coercive back-up, there is every reason to conclude that the number of passengers prepared to take the latter stance would be significantly smaller than in the former.</p>

Of course, if it is utterly impossible to enforce an adjustment and if it is likely to be wholly ignored, it may be said that it is not reasonable to introduce it. But there is no warrant for reaching such a conclusion in the present case. The adjustment to the PCP would, at the very least, make an important statement about the company&#8217;s commitment to ensuring equal treatment for its wheelchair bound customers.

Even if an instruction, as opposed to a request, prompted delay, such as where a driver might refuse to continue the journey until the refusing passenger yielded, that would not be a basis on which the adjustment could be condemned as unreasonable. Wheelchair users face formidable difficulties in making use of facilities that the able-bodied can take for granted. If inconvenience to the travelling public because of delay is the price which has to be paid to allow those who depend on a wheelchair to make maximum use of the transport system which is made available to all, I do not consider that this is, in any sense, unreasonable.</p>

It is not demanded that there be a wholly unyielding application of it in every conceivable circumstance. Even before the Court of Appeal, the appellant accepted that there would be circumstances in which it would not be appropriate to apply the adjusted policy in its full rigour. But, just because there should be a measure of discretion as to when the adjusted policy should be applied, it does not follow that there should not be an adjustment. The inevitable fact that there will be occasions when it would not be appropriate to require a passenger to leave a wheelchair space does not require that the correct policy should not be in place.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Of course, the decision when to enforce the adjusted policy rigidly and when to relax or modify it calls for judgment to be exercised by the bus driver. But there is no reason to suppose that this will require exceptional powers of discretion. It is in the nature of a bus driver&#8217;s work that he or she will need to make decisions about how passengers should be handled or responded to in all manner of circumstances. The fact that there will be circumstances in which a reasonable decision may be made not to enforce a policy strictly does not mean that the policy should not exist. Nothing in the Recorder&#8217;s judgment suggests that he considered that the adjusted policy would have to be enforced in an unbending fashion, whatever circumstances were encountered.</p>

On my analysis, the Recorder had, at least implicitly, accepted that drivers would not be required to eject passengers who refused to move and he had not ruled out the possibility of drivers deciding that, in exceptional circumstances, the policy should not be strictly enforced. The essential finding that he made was that what he described as &#8220;the first come first served/request policy&#8221; required adjustment. It is an inescapable inference from that conclusion that, if the adjustment had been made, there was at least a real prospect that Mr Paulley would not have been prevented from travelling on the bus. That seems to me to be an inescapable inference in any event. If the young woman who refused to move had been told that she had to move and that the bus company&#8217;s policy was that she must do so, how could it be said that there was not a real prospect that she would have moved?</p>

He had not suggested that ejection of the refusing passenger from the bus was an indispensable ingredient of the required adjustment to the PCP. Even if he had done, however, I do not consider that the appellant should have been deprived of the opportunity of arguing that a less rigorous adjustment was appropriate. The essential case made by the appellant was that reasonable adjustments to the policy were required in order to overcome the disparity of treatment between him and able-bodied passengers. The case that he had to make was that the policy was deficient and that reasonable adjustments could have cured, or at least ameliorated, that position. He was not required to adopt unshakeably one particular form of reasonable adjustment to the exclusion of all others. That is, no doubt, the reason that a whole series of possible adjustments was adumbrated on his behalf before the Recorder, as detailed by him in para 13 of his judgment.</p>

A respondent&#8217;s notice is needed where a finding made by a lower court is challenged or where a particular line of argument advanced by the respondent below had been rejected.

It follows that the Regulations do not themselves contemplate that such a person or persons would be asked or required to get off the bus. The Regulations thus balance the interests of wheelchair users and other passengers in a specific way. Since that balance does not contemplate that a person using the space would be asked or required to get off the bus altogether, I did not think that FirstGroup could have been in breach of any duty to Mr Paulley under regulation 12 to direct that the lady with the buggy leave the bus.</p>

Assuming that those were the only relevant regulations governing the duty of the defendant (&#8220;the company&#8221;) in a case of this kind it seemed to me that the only way in which it could be said that it was in breach of duty to the claimant would be as follows. First, the company should have ensured that its drivers considered whether, in circumstances like these, a person with a child and a buggy could (in the words of regulation 12(3)) readily and reasonably vacate the space by moving to another part of the bus. For my part, I do not think that it was sufficient for the driver (or the lady concerned) to refuse to wake the child up if, as appears to have been the case on the facts, he or she was asleep. Moreover, it was not, in my judgment, sufficient for the driver to do no more than ask the lady to move out of the wheelchair space.</p>

The question is whether the bus company made reasonable adjustments to the PCP. The reason that it is not now contested that those adjustments are not reasonable is that both leave the decision whether to vacate the space and to move to another part of the bus entirely to the person using the wheelchair space. Under them, if that person refuses to move, that is the end of it. For the reasons given by Lady Hale and Lord Kerr and (I think) by Lord Neuberger, Lord Toulson and Lord Reed, I agree that the failure to make further adjustments to the PCP was contrary to the law as it stood when the Regulations were introduced.</p>

The next question is whether, if the bus driver had taken further steps to put pressure upon the lady with the buggy, there was a sufficient prospect that she would have moved from her place to another part of the bus sufficient to satisfy the relevant test of causation.</p>

I agree. It seems to me to be a reasonable inference from the facts that it was practicable for her to move to another part of the bus. It was not the evidence of the driver that there was nowhere else she could go. His requests were consistent only with the conclusion that it was both reasonable and practicable for her to move elsewhere on the bus. There is no evidence that she was faced with only two alternatives, namely staying where she was in the wheelchair space or leaving the bus. In these circumstances I agree with Lord Kerr that there is at least a real possibility that, if the position had been explained to her in clear terms, she would have moved elsewhere on the bus, even though it would have involved waking the child. I would go further. It seems to me that, if the problems and the policy had been put clearly to her, it is more likely than not that she would have agreed to do so.</p>

It is common ground that the driver asked the lady if she would move elsewhere in the bus in order to accommodate the wheelchair. It is I think clear that there was somewhere else for her to go on the bus. The further question then arises whether the buggy would have been able to be folded up. Again, it seems to me to be more likely than not that the buggy was foldable. First, although there may be some exceptions, buggies are ordinarily foldable. Secondly, the driver&#8217;s evidence (in his statement) was that he asked the lady if she would fold her buggy up so that Mr Paulley could travel on the bus.

That suggests that he thought that the buggy could be folded up.

Lady Hale has described the Regulations and their provenance in detail in her para 96, which she puts in their context in her paras 93-95 and 98.

As she says, those sections provide that, where providers of transport services had a policy, practice or procedure which would make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled persons to make use of a service which they provided to other members of the public, it was their duty to &#8220;take such steps as is reasonable in all the circumstances of the case for him to take in order to change that practice, policy or procedure so that it no longer has that effect&#8221;.</p>

The first is in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/20/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 20(3)</ref> as modified by the Schedule. It reads:</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;The first requirement is a requirement, where a [PCP] of A&#8217;s puts disabled persons generally at a substantial disadvantage in relation to a relevant matter in comparison with persons who are not disabled, to take such steps as it is reasonable to have to take to avoid the disadvantage.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.00in">As Lady Hale explains in para 99, failure to comply with that requirement is a failure to make reasonable adjustments under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/13/section/21/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 21(1)</ref> and A discriminates against a disabled person if A fails to comply with that duty in relation to that person under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2005/13/section/21/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 21(2)</ref>. This is a prospective duty, owed to disabled persons generally, to take proactive steps to meet their needs, and if an individual suffers as a result, then that failure amounts to discrimination against him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">I agree with the general points made by Lady Hale in para 100. In particular, the position under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2010 Act</ref> is different from that under the Conduct Regulations. Disabled people are a special case. Their needs are to be treated differently from those of others, including those with buggies. As Lady Hale puts it in paras 101 and 102, at the time of the incident the company&#8217;s policy was that wheelchair users had no priority over buggies and that infected both the content of the notices and the approach to enforcement. It should have been made clear to passengers that wheelchair users had priority over others, who should have been required to vacate the wheelchair space. I agree with Lady Hale that disruption and confrontation would be unlikely.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">As indicated above, it is my view that it is more likely than not on the facts here that, if the lady had been required to move, as opposed to merely being asked to do so, she would have done so. I am also of the view that if, contrary to my view of the facts of this case, a buggy cannot be folded down, the PCP should have been adjusted to make it clear that, if necessary to enable a wheelchair user to use the wheelchair space, the buggy user (and not the wheelchair user) must get off the bus. Only in this way will the statutory policy of priority for wheelchair users be carried out.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In reaching this conclusion, I do not disagree with the points made by Lady Hale in para 105. As she says, while non-disabled people are not entitled to the same treatment as disabled people, especially after <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2010 Act</ref>, the adjustments to be expected for disabled people must be reasonable ones, and there will obviously be circumstances in which it is not reasonable to expect the space (or indeed the bus) to be vacated. However, this is not such a case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In conclusion, I agree in particular with the reasoning of Lady Hale and Lord Kerr. I too would allow the appeal. I also would answer the question posed, namely whether the company was in breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2010 Act</ref> in the affirmative. I agree with Lady Hale that, whatever concession may have been made in the Court of Appeal, it cannot be just to deprive Mr Paulley of the damages which the Recorder awarded him. As I say in para 148 above, all parties were in a position to argue the point before this Court. I would therefore restore the order made by the Recorder.</p>
