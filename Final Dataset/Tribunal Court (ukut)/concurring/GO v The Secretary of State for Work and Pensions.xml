	      <p class="Numbered" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">On 8 July 2025 Judge Smith gave the claimant permission to appeal on the grounds that the tribunal had arguably erred in its application of the law (in particular, regulation 4(2A) of the Social Security (Personal Independence Payment) Regulations 2013) to the facts of the claimant&#8217;s case and failed to give adequate reasons for their decision.  The Secretary of State&#8217;s representative supports the appeal, and consents to a decision without reasons if her submissions are accepted.  The claimant also agrees to a decision without reasons.  I shall therefore only give brief reasons for allowing the appeal and remitting the case to a different First-tier Tribunal panel for redetermination.</span></p>

The claimant suffers from a hearing impairment and anxiety.  She has hearing aids, is on anxiety medication and has received cognitive behavioural therapy.  She has said in effect that she is not claiming PIP on account of her anxiety, but that it compounds the difficulties caused by her hearing problems.</span></p>

	      <p class="Numbered" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The claimant&#8217;s appeal came before the First-tier Tribunal on 13 August 2024.  The tribunal awarded the claimant 2 points under descriptor 7(b) in the schedule to the Regulations (&#8220;needs to use an aid or appliance to be able to speak or hear&#8221;) and no points for activity 9.  They dismissed the appeal.  The claimant had argued that she satisfied descriptors 7(e) and 9(d), bearing in mind the references in regulation 4 to performing an activity safely, to an acceptable standard, repeatedly and within a reasonable time period. In her mandatory reconsideration request she had had put her reason for satisfying descriptor 7(e) as being that she could not hear speech unless she was in a very quiet environment.  In a noisy environment she could not hear speech even with her hearing aids because they amplified the background noise as well as the words she was trying to hear.  As to descriptor 9(d) she said &#8216;I cannot mix with other people "as many times as I might need" due to the anxiety it causes when I worry that I will not be able to hear the person/people correctly or, in some cases, (noisy environments) I know I will not be able to hear them at all which is incredibly embarrassing and simply stops me socialising in many different environments&#8217;.</span></p>

I can only interfere with the tribunal&#8217;s decision if the decision involved an error of law.  But the law requires a tribunal to give an adequate statement of their reasons for reaching a particular decision.  A statement of reasons is adequate if it enables the reader to see why the tribunal reached the conclusion they did, in sufficient detail to show whether they applied the law correctly.</span></p>

It contains some errors of fact, but in the main these were not material to the decision.  It refers to some of the claimant&#8217;s evidence, including an audiologist&#8217;s report.  It found that the claimant had difficulties hearing in a group of people or in a noisy background environment, and that this caused her tiredness, frustration and at times feelings of anger.  </span></p>

They did not explain why the claimant did not meet any higher-scoring descriptor under activity 7.  As to activity 9, they found that she could engage with people and form relationships, although she would avoid group social settings such as pubs (the claimant disputes the accuracy of this finding, saying that she avoids socialising generally).</span></p>

They were not of course, obliged to find that any of those descriptors applied to the claimant, since finding the facts is a matter for them.  But they did need to consider explicitly whether the claimant met the descriptors she claimed and, if they decided that she did not, to explain this to the claimant.</span></p>

It is not appropriate for me to remake the decision, which is best done with the expertise of a First-tier Tribunal panel.  I therefore remit the case to be decided by a freshly constituted tribunal.  I have given some directions at the beginning of this decision.  I stress that I have been concerned only with the legal question whether the tribunal gave adequate reasons for their decision.  I have not reached any conclusion on what descriptors the claimant met and nothing in my decision is intended to suggest that I have.</span></p>
