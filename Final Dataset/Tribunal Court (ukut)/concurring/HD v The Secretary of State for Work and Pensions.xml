In a nutshell, the appellant has a number of diagnosed conditions.  During the period of interest, she underwent a &#8220;detox&#8221; treatment from opiate medication.  Her medication changed thereafter.  The evidential picture as to her abilities and functioning, and what she knew about her abilities and functioning, is not straightforward. The question is what does the evidence before the FtT show about her abilities and functioning during the period in question.  Evidently that is not an easy question to answer robustly, as witness the fact that the case is now onto its second successful appeal. </span></p>

In the medical evidence with the claim pack, she gave a history of significant discomfort, the initial award was supported by clinic letters from specialist. The award at this time, namely High Rate Mobility Component because she was virtually unable to walk, and the Highest Rate Care Component because she needed continual supervision throughout the day (due to the risk of falling), and attention frequently or for a prolonged period at night (91), was supported by the evidence available. </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">It is quite clear following the inpatient detox from opiate medication there was a significant improvement in [claimant&#8217;s] conditions. From the first award in 2013 she was heavily medicated, and it appears that the medications affected her ability to function as much as the back pain. By her own account after the detox, she was brighter and more alert (688). She was able to go body boarding from the end of May 2015 she says every couple of weeks. The functionality required to do this, in terms of dressing and undressing. Whether in a swimsuit or wetsuit and walking across a beach to the water is far removed from the restrictions upon which the original award was based. It is impossible to imagine that she would have undertaken this level of activity every 1 &#8211; 2 weeks before the inpatient detox. The Facebook records indicate a level of activity which is not consistent with her statements in the original claim pack &#8211; e.g., that she was &#8220;in the water every day this week&#8221; (407). There is significant evidence of her spending considerable time away from home, for example staying overnight in Plymouth to attend a concert, and 2 trips to Scotland, 1 at Christmas and another for a weekend (a journey recorded as taking 11 hours up and 7 hours back in the van (446)). This is not consistent with a person who requires a special mattress to prevent pressure sores. The Tribunal considers that even if, as was claimed in her oral evidence, she was lying on a mattress in the back of the van during the journeys to Scotland, the exertion and discomfort it involved would have precluded her undertaking this activity prior to detox.</span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">It is right to consider what an Appellant&#8217;s abilities are most of the time, although all facts, including the frequency of bad days, the length of periods of bad days and of intervening periods, and the severity of the Claimant&#8217;s disability on both good and bad days and the unpredictability of bad days are all relevant. [Claimant] has said consistently in her oral evidence and her paperwork that there is no variability in her ability to function. The panel therefore concludes that the evidence of activities as set out in both videos and the Facebook and Twitter entries, is, on the balance of probabilities the level of activity which she could undertake for the majority of the time.</span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1.5in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">The surveillance video showed [claimant] walking down 2 flights of steps, holding onto the railings, 1 step at a time. Part way down the beach she stops to put flippers on and initially walks forward into the sea, subsequently turning round to move backwards towing her body board she serves on the body board, kicking her legs and stays for some time in the water between waist and chest deep. When she comes out, she stops to remove her flippers, and then after about 70 steps she stops and sits on the board to rest. After a while she gets up, and her partner carries the board for her, she stops and sits again, asked her partner for a hand up and they walk up the steps where she sits again before moving to the car. All this was undertaken without her crutch, which she said in oral evidence she normally used, but had &#8220;forgotten&#8221; on that occasion. The Tribunal bears in mind that this video was made more than 12 months after detox, and that immediately after the detox, Declan&#8230;, observing her on the beach, considered that she was &#8220;painfully slow&#8221;. Nevertheless, the Tribunal finds that as of 31 May 2015 [claimant] cannot be considered virtually unable to walk. Bearing in mind the level of activity disclosed in the Facebook and Twitter entries, on the balance of probabilities she could cover 50m reliably and repeatedly without severe discomfort, at a slow steady speed in a reasonable manner.&#8221;</span></p>

I note at pages 58 to 59 of the FtT bundle that the claimant&#8217;s Consultant Neurosurgeon stated the following: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230;any further surgery trying to decompress or consider a long decompression with stabilisation/fusion, would not be the best option considering the chronic nature of her pain and the pain perception change&#8230;&#8221;</span> Additionally there is a letter at pages 60 to 61 from the Pain Consultant that notes the following: <span style="font-style:italic">&#8220;&#8230;In summary I agree with the idea that this lady with failed back surgery syndrome would benefit from attending Pain Management Programme&#8230;She also asked about spinal cord stimulator treatment. I believe that her back pain is very much in the foreground of her symptoms and that her chances to have a meaningful relief from spinal cord stimulator treatment are low. I have explained this to her. I would not recommend this treatment for her.&#8221;.</span></p>

I am still in chronic pain today and I will be in chronic pain for the rest of my life&#8230;Many things fluctuate with my chronic illness and disabilities. One day may be slightly less painful than the next so on a slightly better day, I would &#8216;push through&#8217; my pain&#8230;I want to emphasise that walking any distance causes me severe discomfort.

Therefore, was it not incumbent upon the FtT to consider if the co-morbidity of the claimant&#8217;s long standing health conditions, was in fact a contributing factor to the claimant&#8217;s pain and how she was dealing with the pain? As such, <span style="font-family:Arial">I submit that the information held in the letters provide further insight into the claimant&#8217;s conditions, pain and treatment she has undergone.</span></p>

The FtT do not appear to adequately explain what this may mean for the claimant. Also, it appears upon ones reading that the FtT have placed, at times weight on the evidence collated during the investigation when stating at paragraph 32 of the SOR that: &#8220;&#8230;<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">Bearing in mind the level of activity disclosed in the Facebook and Twitter entries&#8230;&#8221;. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">However, the FtT do not appear to explore further what is stated </span>at paragraph 32 of the SOR that during the investigation:  &#8220;&#8230;Declan&#8230; <span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">observing her on the beach, considered that she was &#8220;painfully slow&#8221;&#8230;&#8221;</span>. Given their acceptance of the varied pain and the observations of being observed to be &#8216;painfully slow&#8217;, I submit that the reader is left in doubt as to what the FtT&#8217;s conclusions are.</p>

When she comes out, she stops to remove her flippers, and then after about 70 steps she stops and sits on the board to rest. After a while she gets up, and her partner carries the board for her, she stops and sits again, asked her partner for a hand up and they walk up the steps where she sits again before moving to the car. All this was undertaken without her crutch, which she said in oral evidence she normally used, but had &#8220;forgotten&#8221; on that occasion&#8230;</span>&#8221;</p>

The result of this is that the FtT have failed to make sufficient findings of fact to determine the claimant&#8217;s functional abilities.  Although the FtT are entitled to reach their own conclusions regarding the available evidence, it also has an obligation to provide adequate reasons to explain how it reached its view concerning the evidence and why it has been disregarded in parts.  In failing to do so I submit that the Tribunal has erred in law, as it has made inadequate findings of facts and reasons in the SOR to support and explain its decision.</p>

The reason for this is that it is said the case is complex and the FtT has so far failed to reach a legally defensible decision on two occasions.  I agree with the premise but not the conclusion.  The case is factually rather than legally complex.  I see no reason why an FTT panel selected with knowledge that the case is more than usually demanding, and knowing in advance that any statement of reasons that might be needed will need to be prepared with particular care should not be able to deal with it at least as well and very probably better than the Upper Tribunal.  In particular it seems to me that an experienced medical member will be essential to robust decision making. </span></p>
