The Court allowed an appeal by Mr Michael Holland (&#8220;Mr Holland&#8221;) against an order dated 4 July 2008 by Mr Mark Cawson QC sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge of the Chancery Division, following a judgment which he issued on 24 June 2008: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2008/2200" uk:canonical="[2008] EWHC 2200 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWHC 2200 (Ch)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] 2 BCLC 613" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] 2 BCLC 613</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2008] STC 3142" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] STC 3142</ref>. The trial over which the deputy judge presided arose out of 42 originating applications issued by HMRC on 27 July 2006 against Mr Holland and his wife Linda. The applications were made under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/212" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45 s. 212" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 212</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Insolvency Act 1986</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IA 1986</ref>&#8221;). It was alleged that Mr and Mrs Holland were de facto directors of 42 insolvent companies of which HMRC is the only creditor, and that they had been guilty of misfeasance and breach of duty in causing the payment of dividends to the companies&#8217; shareholders between 24 April 2002 and 19 October 2004 when the companies had insufficient distributable reserves to pay their creditors. Orders were sought requiring them to contribute sums to the assets of the insolvent companies by way of compensation in respect of their misfeasance and breach of duty of amounts totalling in excess of &#163;3.5m.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The background to the litigation was the setting up by Mr and Mrs Holland in 1999 of a complicated structure of companies, including the 42 companies of which they were alleged to be de facto directors. Their business was the administering of the business and tax affairs of contractors working in various sectors, but mainly that of information technology. Each contractor was taken on as an employee of one of the 42 companies and allotted a non-voting share. This enabled him to be rewarded on a weekly or monthly basis by way of both salary and dividends. The contractors&#8217; services were provided to clients through an agency which paid the parent company. The intention was to provide the same tax advantages to the non-voting shareholders/employees as they would have enjoyed had they each set up and run their own individual service companies, while relieving them of the administrative burden of doing so. It was of the essence of this scheme that each of the 42 companies would be liable to pay corporation tax at the small companies&#8217; rate under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1/section/13" uk:canonical="1988 c. 1 s. 13" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1" uk:canonical="1988 c. 1" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1" uk:canonical="1988 c. 1" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ICTA 1988</ref>&#8221;). So long as they were not regarded as &#8220;associated&#8221; for the purposes of section 416 ICTA 1988, they could achieve this aim provided that each company kept its profits below the &#163;300,000 threshold, which it did. As it turned out, however, the scheme was doomed to fail. By the operation of section 417(3) ICTA 1988 Mr Holland, as the settlor of the one share in each company which had voting rights, fell to be treated as being in control of them. The result was that the 42 companies were treated as associated for tax purposes. Because their collective turnover exceeded the &#163;300,000 threshold, each company was liable for higher rate corporation tax (&#8220;HRCT&#8221;). Dividends had been paid after making provision only for corporation tax at the lower rate. So there was a substantial deficiency in the liquidation of each company in respect of its HRCT liability.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The deputy judge dismissed the claims against Mrs Holland, and there has been no appeal against that decision. He took a different view of the position of Mr Holland. He found that he was a de facto director of each of the 42 companies and so was answerable to HMRC&#8217;s claims under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/212" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45 s. 212" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 212</ref>. He divided the allegations against Mr Holland into three different periods. First, in respect of the period from 24 April 2002 to 18 August 2004, the deputy judge held that Mr Holland was at no stage liable or, if he was, that he ought to be relieved from liability pursuant to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6/section/727" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6 s. 727" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 727</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Companies Act 1985</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1985</ref>&#8221;). Second, he held that Mr Holland was entitled to a short period of grace from 19 to 22 August 2004 as, although he was liable for the payment of dividends during this period, the circumstances were such that he was entitled to be relieved under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6/section/727" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6 s. 727" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 727</ref> from that liability. Third, in respect of the remaining period from 23 August to 19 October 2004, he held that Mr Holland had been guilty of misfeasance and breach of duty in relation to each company in causing the payment to its shareholders of the unlawful dividends, and that it would not be a proper exercise of the power under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6/section/727" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6 s. 727" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 727</ref> to relieve him of that liability: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/ch/2008/2200" uk:canonical="[2008] EWHC 2200 (Ch)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2008">[2008] EWHC 2200 (Ch)</ref>, paras 236-237. He ordered an assessment of the amount that Mr Holland was liable to contribute to the companies&#8217; assets, but he limited this amount to the HRCT that the companies had failed to provide for to meet the claims of HMRC in respect of their trading during that period.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Court of Appeal allowed Mr Holland&#8217;s appeal against the orders which the deputy judge made against him, dismissed the originating applications and dismissed a cross-appeal by HMRC as the points that it sought to raise were no longer in issue. Had it been necessary to decide them it would, by a majority (Rimer LJ dissenting), have dismissed HMRC&#8217;s appeal against the deputy judge&#8217;s decisions to allow Mr Holland a period of grace from 19 to 22 August 2004 and as to the amount that he was liable to contribute to the assets of the companies, its contention being that he should have been ordered to repay the full amount of the unlawful dividends. In the appeal by HMRC to this court all of these points are in issue, although if Mr Holland succeeds on the question whether he was a de facto director the other issues will become academic.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">From about June 1997 to February 1999 Mr and Mrs Holland ran a company called Paycheck Services Ltd (&#8220;Paycheck&#8221;), whose function, in return for a fee, was to administer the business and tax affairs of contractors who did not want to go to the trouble of setting up and running their own companies. Each contractor who joined the scheme became an employee of Paycheck and was allotted a non-voting share in the company. This entitled him to dividends as well as a salary. Paycheck&#8217;s income was derived from charging the contractor&#8217;s clients for his services. Most contractors did not pay higher rate income tax, and the bulk of their income from Paycheck was by way of a dividend. It soon became apparent, however, that the income of Paycheck was likely to exceed the limit for the small companies&#8217; rate of corporation tax of &#163;300,000, which was between 19% and 21% during the relevant period. So Mr and Mrs Holland, with the help of a number of professional advisers, set about devising a new structure which would enable them to expand their business while avoiding corporation tax at the higher rate, which during the relevant period was between 30% and 33%.</p>

It operated until 13 October 2004, when all the companies went into administration and later into liquidation. Under this structure Mr and Mrs Holland each held 50% of the issued shares in, and were directors of, a new company called Paycheck Services Ltd (&#8220;Paycheck Services&#8221;). Paycheck Services held 100% of the issued shares in, and Mr and Mrs Holland were appointed as directors of, two further new companies called Paycheck (Directors Services) Ltd (&#8220;Paycheck Directors&#8221;) and Paycheck (Secretarial Services) Ltd (&#8220;Paycheck Secretarial&#8221;). Paycheck Directors and Paycheck Secretarial were incorporated to act respectively as the sole director and secretary of 42 trading companies (&#8220;the composite companies&#8221;), each of which had similar names distinguished only by a number. Their names were Paycheck Services 3 Ltd, Paycheck Services 4 Ltd, and so on.</p>

The A share was held by yet another new company called Paycheck Services Trustee Limited (&#8220;Paycheck Trustee&#8221;), of which Mr and Mrs Holland were each directors and in which they each held 50% of the issued share capital. The A share was held by Paycheck Trustee pursuant to a Trust Deed of which Mr Holland was the settlor, which provided that each A share was be held for the benefit of the members of the composite companies. The non-voting shares were, in the case of each composite company, held by about 50 shareholders/employees, each of whom held one each of the separate classes of shares in the company.</p>

It recorded as present &#8220;M Holland Paycheck (Director Services) Ltd, LM Holland Paycheck (Secretarial Services) Ltd&#8221; and that it had been resolved that a dividend of a specified amount be distributed to the specified shareholder/employee. The computer generated on the minute a copy of Mr Holland&#8217;s signature, beneath which appeared the words &#8220;for and on behalf of Paycheck (Director Services) Ltd.&#8221; This was the only authority for payment by the composite company of the relevant dividend.</p>

There was, however, a flaw in the structure which, as Rimer LJ said in para 16, was not spotted when the structure was established. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1/section/13/3" uk:canonical="1988 c. 1 s. 13" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 13(3)</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1" uk:canonical="1988 c. 1" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ICTA 1988</ref> limited the benefit of the small companies&#8217; rate by providing that where a company had two or more associated companies during an accounting period they would have to share a single &#163;300,000 limit. Mr Holland was the settlor of the trust under which Paycheck Trustee held the A shares in each of the composite companies. The effect of section 417(3) ICTA 1988 was that Mr Holland was regarded as in control of all the composite companies, so they were &#8220;associated&#8221; within the meaning of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1/section/13" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 13</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1" uk:canonical="1988 c. 1" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">that Act</ref>.

Its effect was believed to be that the composite companies would not be regarded as &#8220;associated&#8221;. It was not appreciated when the new structure was established that the fact that Mr Holland was the common settlor of the A shares in each company meant that he fell to be regarded as being in control of each of the companies, with the result that ESC C9 did not apply. But, as Rimer LJ observed in the Court of Appeal, para 18, the advice that Mr and Mrs Holland received that the companies would not be regarded as &#8220;associated&#8221; was not unqualified.</p>

The deputy judge commented that the advice contained a number of apparent contradictions: para 44. Mr Holland&#8217;s solicitor advised in February 1999 that the two trading companies then in existence should restrict their profits to &#163;150,000 each. In March 2001 the composite companies&#8217; accountants received an informal telephone enquiry about the arrangements from an official at the Wrexham 1 Tax Office. This was followed by a letter in relation to three of the composite companies in which a detailed profit and loss account, with notes to indicate whether the companies were grouped or associated, was requested. The accountants and the solicitor repeated their advice to Mr Holland about restricting profits of each of the two companies to &#163;150,000.</p>

He found that the accountants, and through them Mr Holland, were led to believe in March 2001 that HMRC would treat the matter as covered by ESC C9 and that it was content, in the light of an explanation common to all the composite companies, that there was no association between them: para 66. But he added that it would have been open to HMRC at any time to take the point on the effect of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1/section/417/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 417(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1" uk:canonical="1988 c. 1" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1988 Act</ref> and of Mr Holland&#8217;s position as the settlor of the A shares that was not, in fact, taken until over three years later: para 67. On 24 April 2002 Mr Williams of HMRC wrote to say that in his view the companies were associated. Throughout the rest of 2002 and most of 2003 there was what Rimer LJ called &#8220;sporadic and inconclusive&#8221; correspondence between HMRC and the composite companies&#8217; advisers: para 25. Mr Williams was dissatisfied with the arrangements but he failed to identify its crucial flaw. It was not at this stage suggested to Mr Holland by his advisers that he should cease trading or consider not continuing to cause the composite companies to pay dividends without making provision for HRCT.</p>

On 8 December 2003 it issued closure notices for the years ended 31 July 2000 and 2002 and assessments in relation to the year ended 31 July 2001 on the basis that the composite companies were liable to HRCT. At a meeting of professional advisers on 24 February 2004 the corporation tax deficit, if HMRC were to succeed, was estimated at &#163;2m. Nevertheless it was decided that the composite companies should continue to trade and continue to pay dividends without making any reservation for HRCT.</p>

On 25 June 2004 Mr Russell (who had taken over HMRC&#8217;s file from Mr Williams) wrote expressing the view that the structure was an avoidance scheme and identifying the common settlor point under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1/section/417/3" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 417(3)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1988/1" uk:canonical="1988 c. 1" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1988 Act</ref>. This was the first time that HMRC had taken this point. Mr Holland&#8217;s solicitor sought advice from counsel whose advice had been taken when the scheme was set up. Neither of them identified the importance of the common settlor point raised by HMRC, but on 6 August 2004 another tax counsel advised on the telephone that it &#8220;blows our scheme out of the water.&#8221; In written advice he recommended that the composite companies should cease trading or that the structure should be substantially revised as soon as practicable. He also proposed an alternative structure that would avoid the &#8220;association&#8221; problem and suggested that it might be possible to persuade HMRC not to pursue a claim for periods up to 31 July 2004 if it was adopted. It was decided to take a second opinion from leading counsel, and a conference with Mr John Tallon QC in London was arranged for 18 August 2004. He advised that, although HMRC had dealt with the issue badly and that leave for judicial review might well be granted, the composite companies would ultimately lose if such an application were made. He agreed that the new corporate structure that had been suggested was basically sound and that a letter should be sent requesting a meeting with HMRC in the hope that it might be possible to achieve a favourable settlement.</p>

In the light of Mr Tallon&#8217;s advice Mr Holland&#8217;s solicitor advised him that he and Mrs Holland might be unlawfully trading and that trading should not continue if there was no reasonable prospect of avoiding insolvent liquidation. But Mr Holland was not, for reasons that the deputy judge regarded as understandable, in any mood to engage properly in this discussion: para 160. His solicitor did not repeat the advice that he gave on the train, nor was there any evidence that Mr Holland sought, or was given, advice as to the propriety of continuing to pay dividends.</p>

HMRC were told for the first time of the intention to transfer the business to a new structure. Mr Holland&#8217;s advisers proposed to HMRC that they should accept that ESC C9 did apply to the existing companies to the end of October on the basis that they would cease to trade then, pay all outstanding corporation tax at the small companies&#8217; rate and then be dissolved. It was suggested that the pot available to HMRC would be less if the composite companies were forced to cease trading and go into insolvency. HMRC rejected this proposal. By a letter dated 5 October 2004, which was received on 13 October 2004 and forwarded at once to Mr Holland, Mr Russell made it clear that HRCT was still being sought from 2002. Mr Holland was advised that there was now no prospect of a deal with HMRC and that no further dividends should be declared. No dividends were declared after 13 October 2004. On 19 October 2004 administrators were appointed to the composite companies and the various service contracts were transferred to the new companies. The composite companies were left with a total deficiency of about &#163;3.5m in respect of unpaid corporation tax.</p>

As has already been noted, Paycheck Directors and Paycheck Secretarial were incorporated to act respectively as the sole director and secretary of 42 trading companies. The nineteenth century company law statutes made no provision for corporate directors. The question whether a company could act as the director of another company does not appear to have been raised in any reported case until <span class="case">In re Bulawayo Market and Offices Co Ltd</span><span class="case0"/><span class="dtref" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">[1907] </span>2 Ch 458.

Warrington J dismissed the application without calling on the respondents. He said, at p 463, that there was nothing in the Companies Act 1862 which made it incumbent on a company to have directors who were individual persons and responsible as individuals to the shareholders.</p>

Mr Holland and his advisers cannot be criticised for doing so, as this was expressly permitted by the statute. Drawing on the reasoning in <span class="case">Salomon v A </span><span class="case0" style="font-style:italic">Salomon &amp; Co Ltd</span><span class="case0"/><span class="dtref" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">[1897] </span>AC 22, Mr Knox submitted that the separate legal personality of Paycheck Directors from that of its directors had to be respected. I do not think that he needed the authority of <span style="font-style:italic">Salomon&#8217;s </span>case for that proposition. <span style="font-style:italic">Salomon </span>was concerned with the different question whether, as Lord Macnaghten put it at p 51, a body corporate could lose its individuality by issuing the bulk of its capital to one person. The deputy judge acknowledged that it was not alleged by HMRC that Paycheck Directors was a pure shell or a fa&#231;ade. Nor was it asserted that Mr Holland acted outside his authority as a director of Paycheck Directors in directing the affairs of the composite companies: para 172; see also Rimer LJ, para 47. The question whether Mr Holland was acting as de facto director of the composite companies so as to impose on him fiduciary duties in relation to those companies when the purported directors&#8217; meetings were held on his direction at which the relevant dividends were declared must be approached on the basis that Paycheck Directors and Mr Holland were in law separate persons, each with their own separate legal personality.</p>

The test which he applied at pp 664-665 was whether a man who had assumed a position could be allowed to deny in court that he was really entitled to occupy it. But it is not easy to identify a simple and reliable test for determining whether a person in Mr Holland&#8217;s position was acting as de facto director of a company whose sole director was a company of which he was a director de jure. There are a number of first instance cases which offer some assistance. But I do not think that they provide a clear and simple solution to the problem, as the facts which can give rise to it are so variable.</p>

That was a company which had only two directors, which were two Channel Islands companies.

It was alleged that they were responsible for the wrongful trading of Hydrodam from the date when they were appointed to be directors of Eagle Trust. But, as Millett J observed at p 183, the Channel Islands companies were Hydrodam&#8217;s titular directors and there was nothing pleaded in the points of claim to suggest that there were, in addition to the titular directors, any other persons who claimed to be directors of the company at all. The case was argued on the basis that sufficient facts had been pleaded to justify the inference that Eagle Trust acted as a shadow director of the company, and that as directors of the shadow director its directors were collectively responsible for Eagle Trust&#8217;s conduct in relation to the company as its de facto or shadow directors.</p>

There are significant differences between that case and this. It is not alleged here that Mr Holland was a shadow director and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/212" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45 s. 212" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 212</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IA 1986</ref>, unlike <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/214" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45 s. 214" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 214</ref>, does not extend to shadow directors.

It suggests &#8211; and counsel&#8217;s submissions to me support the inference &#8211; that the liquidator takes the view that de facto or shadow directors are very similar, that their roles overlap, and that it may not be possible to determine in any given case whether a particular person was a de facto or a shadow director. I do not accept that at all. The terms do not overlap. They are alternatives, and in most and perhaps all cases are mutually exclusive.</p>

To establish that a person was a de facto director of a company it is necessary to plead and prove that he undertook functions in relation to the company which could properly be discharged only by a director. It is not sufficient to show that he was concerned in the management of the company&#8217;s affairs or undertook tasks in relation to its business which can properly be performed by a manager below board level.</p>

In my judgment that simply does not follow. Attendance at board meetings and voting, with others, may in certain limited circumstances expose a director to personal liability to the company of which he is a director or its creditors.

The court takes into account all the relevant factors. Those factors include at least whether or not there was a holding out by the company of the individual as a director, whether the individual used the title, whether the individual had proper information (eg management accounts) on which to base decisions, and whether the individual had to make major decisions and so on. Taking all these factors into account, one asks &#8216;was this individual part of the corporate governing structure&#8217;, answering it as a kind of jury question. In deciding this, one bears very much in mind why one is asking the question. That is why I think the passage I quoted from Millett J is important. There would be no justification for the law making a person liable to misfeasance or disqualification proceedings unless they were truly in a position to exercise the powers and discharge the functions of a director. Otherwise they would be made liable for events over which they had no real control, either in fact or law.&#8221;</p>

Everything that he did was done under that umbrella. Mr Green QC for HMRC was unable to point to anything that he did which could not be said to have been done by him in his capacity as a director of the corporate director. When asked what it was that lay outside his performance of that role, he said that it was simply the quality of his acts. He did everything. He was the decision maker, and he was the person who gave effect to those decisions. In <span style="font-style:italic">Hydrodam </span>at p 184 Millett J rejected the proposition that, where a body corporate is a director of a company, whether it be de jure, de facto or shadow director, its own directors must ipso facto be shadow directors of the subject company. He said that attendance at board meetings and voting with others did not, without more, constitute him a director of any company of which his company is a director. That would not be a fair description of what Mr Holland did in this case. But in a later paragraph on p 184 Millett J said this:</p>

As Lord Davey said at p 54, the intention of the legislature must be collected from the language of its enactments. One can properly say, as Lord Macnaghten did about the company and its subscribers at p 51, that a company is at law a different person from its directors and that it is the intention of the enactment that this distinction should be recognised. I do not think that one can overcome this distinction by pointing, as Mr Green seeks to do, simply to the quality of the acts done by the director and asking whether he was the guiding spirit of the subject company or had a real influence over its affairs. As a test, that would create far too much uncertainty. Those who act as directors of a corporate director are entitled to know what it is that they can and cannot do when they are procuring acts by the corporate director. That is as true of a case such as this, where the affairs of the corporate director are effectively in the hands of one individual, as it is where there is a board comprised of several directors who always act collectively. As Lord Collins says (see paras 53 and 95, below), the question is one of law and it is a question of principle. I think that the guiding principle can be expressed in this way, unless and until Parliament provides otherwise. So long as the relevant acts are done by the individual entirely within the ambit of the discharge of his duties and responsibilities as a director of the corporate director, it is to that capacity that his acts must be attributed.</p>

As counsel for HMRC pointed out in their written case, there has been no challenge to the finding by the deputy judge that as from 18 August 2004 all the dividends were unlawful, and it is accepted that the relief available by way of a defence under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6/section/727" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6 s. 727" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 727</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1985</ref> would have been available if Mr Holland could show that he acted reasonably. So the issue is academic here, and it was no doubt for this reason that it was not thought to be necessary to develop the point fully in oral argument. But the better view seems to me that in cases such as this, where it is accepted that the payment of dividends was unlawful, a director who causes their payment is strictly liable, subject of course to his right to claim relief under the statute.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Then there is the question whether the correct remedy for any breach of the duties of a director not to make unlawful payments of dividends is damages or equitable compensation for the net loss sustained by the company, or restitution or restoration of the amount of the unlawful dividends without any inquiry into the loss sustained. The deputy judge held that the established remedy was to require the director to reinstate the amount of the payment without any inquiry as to the loss suffered by the company as a result of the breach of duty: para 218. But he declined to make an order in these terms. What he did, having refused relief under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6/section/727" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6 s. 727" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 727</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1985</ref> for this period as he held that Mr Holland had not acted reasonably in paying the dividend without taking all appropriate advice and properly informing himself, was to order him to pay the amount of HRCT that the companies had not provided for in the period of trading from 23 August 2004. He said that he was doing this in the exercise of his discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/212" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45 s. 212" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 212</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IA 1986</ref>: para 274.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with the Court of Appeal that the obligation is to restore the moneys wrongfully paid out. This, as the deputy judge accepted, is the established remedy. Where dividends have been paid unlawfully, the directors&#8217; obligation is to account to the company for the full amount of those dividends: see <span class="case">Bairstow v Queens Moat Houses plc</span><span class="case0"/><span class="dtref" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">[2001]</span> EWCA Civ 712, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2001] 2 BCLC 531" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] 2 BCLC 531</ref>, para 54, per Robert Walker LJ. But there is a discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/212" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45 s. 212" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 212</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">IA 1986</ref> that it is open to the judge to exercise. This is indicated by the use of the word &#8220;may&#8221; in subsection (3). Rimer LJ said that the judge&#8217;s order should have reflected the wrong that had actually been committed and the fact that he had refused relief under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6/section/727" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6 s. 727" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 727</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1985</ref> in respect of it. Elias LJ, paras 133-134, and Ward LJ, para 143, disagreed. In their view it was open to the deputy judge to limit the amount that Mr Holland should pay to what HMRC had lost from his unlawful conduct. Had it been necessary to reach a view on this point, I would have agreed with the majority. HMRC is the only creditor. There is no evidence that anyone would have been disadvantaged by limiting the liability in this way. It would have been a different matter if the deputy judge had misdirected himself as to the extent of the obligation. That plainly is not so. As he made clear in para 274 of his judgment, he proceeded on the basis that, while restoration is the established remedy, he had a discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/212" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45 s. 212" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 212</ref> IA 1986 to limit the award to what was required to make up the deficiency of a particular creditor where the claim was made by a party other than the liquidator. In my opinion it was open to him to exercise his discretion in this way, and I do not think that he can be faulted for doing so in this case.</p>

There are two points. First, there is the decision by the deputy judge that Mr Holland was entitled to a few days grace after the events of 18 August 2004 to enable him to take stock. Rimer LJ thought the deputy judge was in error in giving Mr Holland this grace period: para 88. He said that Mr Holland had not conducted himself so as to deserve it and that there was no factual basis for the decision. Here too Elias LJ, para 128, and Ward LJ, para 138, disagreed. Elias LJ said that there was evidence justifying the deputy judge&#8217;s analysis. I respectfully agree with the majority on this point too. It seems to me that the judge provided a sufficient explanation for his decision in paras 269-270, and that his was a decision with which an appellate court could not properly interfere.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The second question is whether, as Mr Knox submitted, the judge should have gone further and relieved Mr Holland from the obligation to pay anything at all. He suggested that account should have been taken of the fact that, as he put it, the course taken by Mr Holland was the least bad of all the alternatives. I do not see how, on the facts found by the deputy judge, this argument can be supported. He found that Mr Holland acted unreasonably because he did not take appropriate advice or inform himself as to the merits of what he was doing. But there is a more fundamental point. Mr Knox submitted that the discretion under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/212" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45 s. 212" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 212</ref> was wide enough to allow the court to reduce the award to nil even if it declined relief under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6/section/727" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6 s. 727" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 727</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CA 1985</ref>.

It is not so wide as to allow the judge, having determined that the section applies, to decline to make any order at all: paras 108-110. The discretion which he is given by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/45/section/212/3" uk:canonical="1986 c. 45 s. 212" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 212(3)</ref> is as to the order that would be appropriate once liability has been established, not to grant relief against liability. It is a discretion as to how much the director should be ordered to pay, so as to do what is just in all the circumstances:<span class="case"> Re Loquitur Ltd</span><span class="case0"/><span class="dtref" style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">[2003] </span>2 BCLC 442, per Etherton J at para 245.

In my judgment what divides this court is not simply a matter of appreciation of the facts, namely whether what Mr Holland did in fact was sufficient to make him a de facto director of the composite companies, but a question of law and a question of principle. The question is whether fiduciary duties can be imposed, in relation to a company whose sole director is a corporate director, on a director of that corporate director when all of his relevant acts were done as a director of the corporate director and can be attributed in law solely to the activities of the corporate director.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">My reasons will require some elaboration, particularly because they involve examination of older case law which was not cited in argument, but can be summarised in this way. Mr Holland is sought to be made liable for breach of fiduciary duty as a de facto director of the composite companies. For almost 150 years de facto directors in English law were persons who had been appointed as directors, but whose appointment was defective, or had come to an end, but who acted or continued to act as directors. There was a striking judicial innovation in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1988] Ch 477" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1988">[1988] Ch 477</ref> and<span style="font-style:italic"> Re Hydrodam (Corby) Ltd</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] 2 BCLC 180" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] 2 BCLC 180</ref> (endorsed by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Kaytech International plc</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 BCLC 351" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 BCLC 351</ref>) by which (at the risk of over-simplification) persons who were held to be part of the corporate governance of a company, even though not directors, could be treated as directors for the purposes of statutory provisions relating to such matters as wrongful trading by, and disqualification of, directors. To extend that line of authority so as to impose fiduciary duties on Mr Holland in relation to the composite companies, when all of his acts can be attributed in law solely to the activities of Paycheck Directors would be an unjustifiable judicial extension of the concept of de facto director, and best left to the legislature, given that it was as recently as 2006 that it intervened to require that at least one director of a company be a natural person: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Companies Act 2006</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46/section/155/1" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46 s. 155" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 155(1)</ref>.</p>

The Court of Appeal held the directors jointly and severally liable for the amount of the dividends. The principle was put by Sir George Jessel MR (at p 534): &#8220;It follows then that if directors who are quasi trustees for the company improperly pay away the assets to the shareholders, they are liable to replace them.&#8221; It is not suggested that (in the absence of dishonesty) persons who facilitate the payment of unlawful dividends are responsible for knowing assistance in a breach of trust.</p>

The basis of that decision is that a director who makes fraudulent representations is liable in deceit irrespective of whether he makes the representations on behalf of a company. The decision of the Court of Appeal, which was reversed by the House of Lords and which had held that he was not liable because he had been acting on behalf of the company, was plainly wrong (although I used more diplomatic language in <span style="font-style:italic">Daido Asia Japan Co Ltd v Rothen </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] BCC 589" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] BCC 589</ref>). But in the present case there can be no suggestion that Mr Holland is not responsible because the corporate director is responsible. He will be responsible if what he did was unlawful. The question, to which it is now necessary to turn, is whether he was himself in breach of duty.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Most of the early cases are about the validity of the acts of de facto directors, but they are relevant to the question of principle, namely what makes a person a de facto director. The first mention in the case law of de facto directors appears to have been in <span style="font-style:italic">Mangles v Grand Collier Dock Co </span>(1840) 10 Simons 519, a case involving the formation of a dock company by private Act of Parliament. Sir Lancelot Shadwell V-C said (at p 535) that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> assumed that persons by whom a call was made had to be directors de facto, and that all that Parliament meant was that, if the call were made by persons appearing to be directors, it should not be necessary to prove their appointment. The first full discussion of the de facto director was in the famous case of <span style="font-style:italic">Foss v Harbottle</span> (1843) 2 Hare 461, which was of course concerned with the right of shareholders in a company incorporated by Act of Parliament to sue for wrongs alleged to have been done to the company, a matter which has no relevance to the present appeal. The shareholders claimed that the extinction of the board of directors by the bankruptcy and consequent disqualification of three of them, and the want of any clerk or officer, effectually prevented the due convening of a general meeting of shareholders competent to secure the remaining property of the company, and provide for its due application. That argument was rejected on the basis that the continued existence of a board of directors <span class="Emphasis" style="font-style:normal">de facto</span> must be intended; and that the possibility of convening a general meeting of shareholders capable of controlling the acts of the existing board was not excluded by the allegations of the bill; that in such circumstances there was nothing to prevent the company from obtaining redress in its corporate character in respect of the matters complained of. Sir James Wigram V-C held that shareholders could serve a notice requiring an extraordinary general meeting at the place where &#8220;the board of directors de facto, whether qualified or not, carry on the business of the company at a given place&#8230;&#8221; (at p 496).

Its articles of association required (inter alia) that the directors at a board meeting had to certify their approval of the proposed transferee. Bush was a shareholder and a director. The articles also required directors to have a share qualification. The transfer was approved at a board meeting, but it was claimed that three of the directors were not duly appointed because they had not executed a deed binding themselves to obey the regulations of the company. The Joint Stock Companies Act 1844, section 30, provided that notwithstanding that it might be afterwards discovered that there was some defect or error in the appointment of the directors, any acts of those directors were to be valid. The House of Lords was equally divided on the outcome of the appeal (which was from a decision of Lord Hatherley LC<span style="font-weight:bold">, </span>who also sat on the appeal) and therefore the appeal was dismissed. Lord Cairns and Lord Hatherley decided that the transfer was to be treated as valid because of section 30 and because the company itself had approved the transfer. Lord Hatherley (at pp 76-77) referred to directors to whom section 30 applied as directors de facto. This case concerned persons who acted in all respects as if they were directors.</p>

This they did in the face of the subscribers to and shareholders in the company, as well as of persons dealing with the company; and both before the company was legally formed, and after it was formed, they publicly advertised themselves in the prospectus as directors and secretary respectively. They occupied the offices designated in the prospectus and they opened an account with the bank therein named. During the six months following they assumed, to the exclusion of all others, the executive functions of the company; no subscribers, nor shareholders, nor strangers dealt with any one else, and no one questioned their authority.

The issue was whether a penalty under the Companies Act 1862 for failure to file an annual return could be imposed under a section which imposed the penalty on the company and on &#8220;every director and manager of the company who shall knowingly and wilfully authorise or permit such default&#8221;. The appellant was held to have been rightly convicted because he had been permitted by the board to manage the company generally, just as if he had been legally appointed to act as manager. Blackburn J also dealt with the position of directors, but he also was plainly thinking of a director whose appointment was defective, or, as he put it, &#8220;illegally elected.&#8221; He said (at pp 338-339):</p>

No doubt the appellant is called secretary, but was he a person to whom the whole management had been delegated, probably improperly delegated, by the board of directors, and who had taken upon himself to act as sole manager? He himself says in the minutes, &#8216;The secretary,&#8217; that is himself, &#8216;reported that, in order to comply with the requirement of the Joint Stock Companies Acts he had called a general meeting of the shareholders,&#8217; &amp;c. &#8230; That is evidence upon which the Lord Mayor might find that he had taken on himself the management of the company; he has of his own authority done an act which was to be done only by the directors. So, again, in the letter he tells the directors he will call a meeting. I do not say he had power to call a meeting. I think he had not, but I think that is evidence that he had assumed to act for the directors, and had taken the management of the company on himself. The Lord Mayor rightly drew the inference that the appellant was, by his own wrong, manager of the company.&#8221;</p>

The point I have to consider is whether the person who acts as de facto director is a director within the meaning of this section, or whether he can afterwards be allowed to deny that he was a director within the meaning of this section. I think he cannot. We are familiar in the law with a great number of cases in which a man who assumes a position cannot be allowed to deny in a court of justice that he really was entitled to occupy that position. The most familiar instance is that of executor de son tort. In like manner, it seems to me, in an application under this section, the de facto director is a director for the purposes of this section.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Once the concept of de facto director was divorced from the unlawful holding of office, there were two consequences. The first consequence was that the distinction between de facto directors and shadow directors was eroded. A shadow director is &#8220;a person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors of the company are accustomed to act&#8221;: <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Companies Act 1985</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6/section/741/2" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6 s. 741" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 741(2)</ref>; <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Companies Act 2006</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46/section/251/1" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46 s. 251" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 251(1)</ref>.

They are alternatives and in most and perhaps all cases are mutually exclusive.&#8221; But the distinction was impossible to maintain with the extension of the concept of de facto directorship and the consideration of such matters as the taking of major decisions by the individual, which might be through instructions to the de jure directors, and the evaluation of his real influence in the affairs of the company: see <span style="font-style:italic">Re Kaytech International plc</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 BCLC 351" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 BCLC 351</ref>, 424, per Robert Walker LJ. The second consequence is that the courts were confronted with the very difficult problem of identifying what functions were in essence the sole responsibility of a director or board of directors. A number of tests have been suggested of which the following are the most relevant. First, whether the person was the sole person directing the affairs of the company (or acting with others equally lacking in a valid appointment), or if there were others who were true directors, whether he was acting on an equal footing with the others in directing its affairs: <span style="font-style:italic">Re Richborough Furniture Ltd</span>. Second, whether there was a holding out by the company of the individual as a director, and whether the individual used the title: <span style="font-style:italic">Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Tjolle</span>. Third, taking all the circumstances into account, whether the individual was part of &#8220;the corporate governing structure&#8221;: <span style="font-style:italic">Secretary of State for Trade and Industry v Tjolle</span>, at pp 343-344, approved in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Kaytech International plc</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 BCLC 351" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 BCLC 351</ref>, 423, where Robert Walker LJ also approved the way in which Jacob J in <span style="font-style:italic">Tjolle </span>had declined to formulate a single test. He also said that the concepts of shadow director and de facto director had in common &#8220;that an individual who was not a de jure director is alleged to have exercised real influence (otherwise than as a professional adviser) in the corporate governance of a company&#8221; (at p 424).

It seems to me that in the present context of the fiduciary duty of a director not to dispose wrongfully of the company&#8217;s assets, the crucial question is whether the person assumed the duties of a director. Both Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Lo-Line </span>(at p 490) and Millett J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Hydrodam</span> (at p 183) referred to the assumption of office as a mark of a de facto director. In <span style="font-style:italic">Fayers Legal Services Ltd v Day</span>, (unreported) 11 April 2001, a case relating to breach of fiduciary duty, Patten J, rejecting a claim that the defendant was a de facto director of the company and had been in breach of fiduciary duty, said that in order to make him liable for misfeasance as a de facto director the person must be part of the corporate governing structure, and the claimants had to prove that he assumed a role in the company sufficient to impose on him a fiduciary duty to the company and to make him responsible for the misuse of its assets. It seems to me that that is the correct formulation in a case of the present kind.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">There is no material to suggest that Mr Holland was doing anything other than discharging his duties as the director of the corporate director of the composite companies. It does not follow from the fact that he was taking all the relevant decisions that he was part of the corporate governance of the composite companies or that he assumed fiduciary duties in respect of them. If he was a de facto director of the composite companies simply because he was the guiding mind behind their sole corporate director, then that would be so in the case of every company with a sole corporate director. The development of the law of de facto directors from <span style="font-style:italic">Re Lo-Line </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Re Hydrodam </span>onwards was a significant judicial innovation given that for some 150 years de facto directors meant individuals who had actually been appointed, or purportedly appointed, as directors. As has been seen, in two of the three older cases which dealt with the liability of de facto directors, an analogy was drawn with executors de son tort: <span style="font-style:italic">Gibson v Barton</span> (1875) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="LR 10 QB 329" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">LR 10 QB 329</ref> and <span style="font-style:italic">Re </span><span class="Emphasis">Canadian Land Reclaiming and Colonising Co, </span><span style="font-style:italic">Coventry and Dixon&#8217;s case </span>(1880) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="14 Ch D 660" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">14 Ch D 660</ref>. That suggests strongly that the basis of liability was the assumption of responsibility. The legislature has already intervened in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2006 Act</ref> to ensure that there is a natural person to whom responsibility is attributed. The purpose of what became <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Companies Act 2006</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46/section/155/1" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46 s. 155" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 155(1)</ref>, was to ensure that every company would have at least one individual who could, if necessary, be held to account for the company&#8217;s actions: Department of Trade and Industry, <span style="font-style:italic">Company Law Reform </span>(Cm 6456, 2005), para 3.3. For the court to hold that every significant decision of individual directors of a corporate director is to be regarded as being taken as if they were directors of the company of which it is the corporate director goes considerably beyond the law as it has been developed at first instance and by the Court of Appeal in the modern de facto director cases, and beyond what I would regard as the function of the court. I would not wish to question the modern judicial development of the de facto director concept, and I well understand the policy reasons why in such a case as this a person in the position of Mr Holland should be liable, although those reasons may not be as powerful as they were prior to the enactment of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Companies Act 2006</ref>, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46/section/155/1" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46 s. 155" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 155(1)</ref>. The legislature could have intervened to require that all directors be natural persons, as under the Corporations Act 2001, section 201B (Australia), the Canada Business Corporations Act 1985, section 105(1)(c), the New York Business Corporation Law, section 701, and the Delaware General Corporate Law, section 141(b). But it did not, and in my judgment the proposed extension which is inherent in HMRC&#8217;s case is a matter for the legislature and not for this court.</p>

In my judgment, it does not follow from the fact that Mr Holland caused the corporate director to make decisions in relation to the composite companies that he was accordingly a de facto director of the composite companies.

But for a company to pay an endless stream of interim dividends, with no final dividend ever recommended by the directors and approved by the company in general meeting, could not be a proper exercise of the powers conferred by the article. That conclusion is reinforced by the opening words of article 8(b)(i) (&#8220;&#8230;such dividends payable on each such class of Shares in such amounts, at such frequency, at such times as, on the recommendation of the Directors, the holder of the A share shall, in General Meeting, resolve &#8230;&#8221;).</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">Millett J went on to explain in detail why the pleaded case was so deficient. Hydrodam&#8217;s liquidator had made claims for wrongful trading against numerous respondents including two individuals who were (with six or seven co-directors) directors of Eagle Trust plc (&#8220;Eagle&#8221;) of which Hydrodam was (at two removes) an indirect subsidiary. The pleaded case against the two individuals was that they were &#8220;collectively responsible&#8221; for decisions taken by Eagle in relation to Hydrodam. In that case, the judge said, it was Eagle, not two members of its fairly large board, who should be regarded as a shadow director: (at p 184) &#8220;but if all they have done is to act in their capacity as directors of the ultimate holding company, in passing resolutions at board meetings, then in my judgment the holding company is the shadow director of the subsidiary, and they are not&#8221;. To put the point another way, in the statutory definition of &#8220;shadow director&#8221;, the context in which &#8220;person&#8221; is used does not permit the singular to include the plural.</p>

It is unnecessary to embark on a lengthy discussion of all the first-instance authorities. There are three main points of qualification. First, Millett J said that a de facto director &#8220;assumes&#8221; to act as such, is &#8220;held out&#8221; as such, and &#8220;claims and purports&#8221; to be a director. That is true of some of the early cases in which an apparently de jure director had been disqualified by failing to obtain the requisite share qualification, or by bankruptcy (see for instance the cases mentioned by Sir Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson V-C in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Lo-Line Electric Motors Ltd </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1988] Ch 477" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1988">[1988] Ch 477</ref>, 489-490).

In my view Mr Holland was acting both as a de jure director of Paycheck Directors and as a de facto director of the composite companies. A de facto director is not formally invested with office, but if what he actually does amounts to taking all important decisions affecting the relevant company, and seeing that they are carried out, he is acting as a director of that company.

In truth it provides no such support. The issue in that case related to the personal liability of a director for a misleading projection, prepared in large part by him and issued by the company, as to the profits which the plaintiffs might earn by opening a health food shop under a franchise.

So it was, and there has never been any pleading or finding of dishonesty against Mr Holland. Nevertheless there is to my mind a significant parallel between liability for deceit (which is in Lord Rodger&#8217;s words &#8220;so self-evident that we do not consider it as resulting from a breach of duty&#8221;) and the unqualified statutory prohibition in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6/section/263" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6 s. 263" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 263</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1985/6" uk:canonical="1985 c. 6" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Companies Act 1985</ref> on payment of a dividend otherwise than out of available profits. Contravention of this prohibition is a statutory wrong giving rise to strict liability, and anyone who is in a position to contravene it is likely to be in a fiduciary position (see further below). Mr Holland was the human cause of (and apart from his wife&#8217;s secretarial assistance, the only human being who took any part in) the payment of unlawful dividends. They were, as Rimer LJ said (para 112) payments which should never have been made. Mr Holland is liable for the payments because he deliberately made them.

In this case the assumption of responsibility equates with the fiduciary duty that a company director owes to his company not to make an unauthorised distribution of capital. But in the circumstances of this case I think that there would be some element of putting the cart before the horse in looking for a fiduciary duty before looking at what Mr Holland did, because it is what he did that demonstrates that he was undertaking responsibility and exposing himself to a claim for breach of fiduciary duty.</p>

He formulates the question at para 53 as being whether fiduciary duties can be imposed, in relation to a company whose sole director is a corporate director, on a director of that corporate director when all of his relevant acts were done as a director of the corporate director and can be attributed in law solely to the activities of the corporate director. That appears to me to be a similar principle to that stated by Lord Hope at para 42 that, so long as the relevant acts are done by the individual entirely within the ambit of the discharge of a person&#8217;s duties and responsibilities as a director of a corporate director, it is to that capacity that his acts must be attributed.</p>

The test stated by Patten J was whether the defendant was part of the corporate governing structure; the claimant had to prove that he assumed a role in the company sufficient to impose upon him a fiduciary duty to the company and make him responsible for the misuse of its assets.</p>

In most cases, it is logical and, to my mind, correct in principle to ask the single question whether he is a de facto director. If he is, it follows that he owes fiduciary duties. If he is not, it equally follows that he does not. It may have been appropriate to ask a rolled up question in the <span style="font-style:italic">Fayers Legal Services </span>case because the issue there was whether what the alleged director did amounted to acting in a directorial manner on the facts. It was held by Patten J at para 73 that his acts were essentially managerial and not directorial. It may well have been relevant to the issue in that case to ask whether the acts performed by him were of a kind which might be expected to give rise to a fiduciary duty and thus to be the acts of a de facto director.</p>

I agree that those are relevant questions to ask but I also agree with Lord Walker that they are questions of fact. So too are other questions identified in the authorities. Examples include those given by Lord Collins in para 91 including the following: whether the individual was taking the major decisions, which might be through instructions to the de jure directors, and what was real influence in the affairs of the company (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re Kaytech International plc </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1999] 2 BCLC 351" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1999">[1999] 2 BCLC 351</ref>, per Robert Walker LJ at p 424); whether he was the sole person directing the affairs of the company or whether there were others who were the true directors and whether he was acting on an equal footing with the others (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re Richborough Furniture Ltd </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 1 BCLC 507" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 1 BCLC 507</ref>); and whether he exercised real influence, otherwise than as a professional adviser, in the corporate governance of the company (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re Kaytech </span>at p 424).

There can be no doubt that the decision to pay dividends was a directorial act and not a mere managerial act. It seems to me that, if (as the deputy judge has held), Mr Holland in fact deliberately procured the payment of the dividends by the directors of Paycheck Directors and had the de facto power to do so, he was a de facto director. As such, he owed a fiduciary duty to the company and the procuring of the payment of the dividends was a breach of fiduciary duty and, on the deputy judge&#8217;s findings of fact, an unlawful act. He is accordingly liable to restore the dividends.</p>

As he explains, and is not in dispute, all the decisions were made by Mr Holland. Each decision by Mr Holland to procure Paycheck Directors to pay the dividends without reserving for the relevant composite company&#8217;s liability to tax was a decision to commit an unlawful act. Each decision was, as I see it, a decision to carry out the underlying decision previously made by Mr Holland, who was then wearing a number of hats, that none of the composite companies would reserve for higher rate tax. When each decision to pay a particular dividend was made, he was thus acting, both as a de jure director of Paycheck Directors and as a de facto director of the particular composite company. Moreover, he was not acting merely as a director of Paycheck Directors, but pursuant to a decision he had already made wearing all his hats.</p>

There is no reason in principle why a person may not act in more than one capacity. The question is again one of fact. On the deputy judge&#8217;s findings of fact, Mr Holland was not merely discharging his duties as a director of the corporate director. He was in fact acting as a director of the composite companies by deciding (after taking leading counsel&#8217;s advice) that the composite companies should both continue trading and continue paying dividends without reserving for higher rate corporation tax and by procuring the directors of Paycheck Directors as a director of the composite companies to pay the unlawful dividends. The specific decision in each case was no more than an implementation of the scheme which he had devised (as described by Lord Walker) by entering the particular figures in the computer programme and authorising payments to the particular shareholders/employees.</p>

Suppose, for example, his wife was the sole director of Paycheck Directors and he had instructed her to pay the dividends and she had done so without giving independent thought to the matter, he would surely have been doing so as inter alia a de facto director of the composite companies. The fact that he was a director of Paycheck Services to my mind would make no difference.</p>

Indeed, he was the sole person directing the affairs of the company. There were no others who were taking decisions other than in accordance with his directions. In short, he exercised real influence, otherwise than as a professional adviser, in the corporate governance of the company. In so concluding I use the expression corporate governance in the sense used in the Cadbury Report as being the system by which the composite companies businesses were directed and controlled.
