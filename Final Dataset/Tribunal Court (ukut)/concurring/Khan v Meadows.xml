	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">A woman approaches a general medical practice for testing to establish whether she is a carrier of a hereditary disease. Tests which are inappropriate to answer that question are arranged. A general medical practitioner when informing her of the results of those tests negligently fails to advise her that she needs a genetic test to establish whether she is a carrier of the relevant gene. In fact, she is a carrier of the disease. Several years later, she gives birth to a baby boy who sadly not only suffers from the hereditary disease but also has an unrelated disability. Is the medical practitioner liable in negligence for the costs of bringing up the disabled child who has both conditions or only for those costs which are associated with the hereditary disease?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant was alerted to the possibility that she was a carrier of the haemophilia gene, which can give rise to the hereditary disease in which the ability of blood to coagulate is severely reduced, when in January 2006 her nephew was born and subsequently diagnosed as having haemophilia. The appellant wished to avoid having a child with that condition. She therefore consulted a general medical practitioner, Dr Athukorala, in August 2006 with a view to establishing whether she was a carrier of that gene. The blood tests which were arranged were those which establish whether a patient has haemophilia. They could not confirm whether she was a carrier of the haemophilia gene. In order to obtain that information, the appellant should have been referred to a haematologist for genetic testing.</p>

Dr Khan told her that the results were normal. As a result of the advice which she received in this and the earlier consultation the appellant was led to believe that any child she might have would not have haemophilia.</p>

In those circumstances, she would have undergone foetal testing for haemophilia when she became pregnant in 2010. That testing would have revealed that her son was affected by haemophilia. If so informed, the appellant would have chosen to terminate her pregnancy and A would not have been born.</p>

He does not understand the benefit of the treatment he requires and so his distress is heightened. He will not report to his parents when he has a bleed. He is likely to be unable to learn and retain information, to administer his own medication, or to manage his own treatment plan. New therapies for treatment of haemophilia may mean that his prognosis in respect of haemophilia is significantly improved. However, in itself, his autism is likely to prevent him living independently or being in paid employment in the future.</p>

Much of the debate before Yip J concerned two judgments of the Court of Appeal: <span style="font-style:italic">Parkinson v St James and Seacroft University Hospital NHS Trust</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2001/530" uk:canonical="[2001] EWCA Civ 530" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] EWCA Civ 530</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] QB 266" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] QB 266</ref> (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Parkinson</span>&#8221;) and <span style="font-style:italic">Groom v Selby</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2001/1522" uk:canonical="[2001] EWCA Civ 1522" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2001">[2001] EWCA Civ 1522</ref>; [2002] Lloyd&#8217;s Rep Med 1 (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Groom</span>&#8221;). In the first case, Mrs Parkinson became pregnant following a failed sterilisation. Her son was born with severe disabilities which were not connected to the sterilisation. In the second case, Mrs Groom underwent a sterilisation operation at a time when unknown to anyone she was about six days pregnant. Shortly afterwards, she consulted her general practitioner who failed to arrange a pregnancy test or examine her to see if she was pregnant. By the time she discovered her pregnancy, she did not wish to have a termination, but she would have terminated the pregnancy if informed sooner. She later gave birth to a child with salmonella meningitis resulting in severe disability. In each case, there was no direct connection between the negligence of the medical practitioner and the disability. In the first case the source of the child&#8217;s disability was genetic and in the second the disability arose from exposure to a bacterium during the process of her birth. In each case, the mother had not wanted to have any further children and she sought the services of the defendants for that purpose.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In each case, in which Brookes LJ and Hale LJ gave the substantive judgments, the Court of Appeal held, in accordance with the judgments of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">McFarlane v Tayside Health Board</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 2 AC 59" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 2 AC 59</ref>, which concerned negligent medical advice after a vasectomy, that a parent could not be compensated for the basic maintenance of a healthy, much loved child. But the court held in each case that that ruling did not extend to the birth of a child with significant disabilities and that the claimant could recover compensation for the extra costs of providing for the child&#8217;s special needs and care relating to the child&#8217;s disability. In each case, the court held, among other things, that the birth of the child with such disabilities was a foreseeable consequence of the medical practitioner&#8217;s negligence, that the medical practitioner should be deemed to have assumed responsibility for such an outcome and that the imposition of such liability was not unjust, unfair or disproportionate.</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">In addressing those questions and reaching the conclusion that the defendant was liable, Yip J relied principally on two considerations. First, she held that the focus of the defendant&#8217;s duty and the claimant&#8217;s purpose in seeking the service was to provide the claimant with the necessary information to allow her to terminate any pregnancy afflicted by haemophilia (para 62). Secondly, the defendant assumed a responsibility which, if properly fulfilled, would have avoided the birth of A (para 63). She concluded that it was not fair, just and reasonable to distinguish between the mother who wanted to terminate this pregnancy and the mother who would have wanted to terminate any pregnancy; nor did any principle of distributive justice require such a distinction to be made (para 68). Yip J therefore sought to apply the approach of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Parkinson</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Groom</span> and awarded the claimant &#163;9m.</p>

The leading judgment was delivered by Nicola Davies LJ. The court distinguished the facts of this case from <span style="font-style:italic">Parkinson</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Groom</span>: the focus of the consultation, advice and appropriate testing was directed to the issue of whether Ms Meadows was a carrier of the haemophilia gene and not the wider issue of whether she should become pregnant. The scope of duty test which Lord Hoffmann identified in <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> was determinative of the issues which the court had to address (para 27). In short, Dr Khan was not liable for the costs associated with A&#8217;s autism because that type of loss was not within the scope of the risks which she had undertaken to protect Ms Meadows against and therefore was not within the scope of her duty of care. The purpose of the consultation was to put Ms Meadows in a position to make an informed decision in relation to a child which she conceived which was discovered to carry the haemophilia gene. Secondly, the doctor was liable for the risk of the mother giving birth to a child with haemophilia because there had been no foetal testing and consequently no termination of the pregnancy. But the mother would take the risks of all other potential difficulties of the pregnancy and birth, both to herself and to her child. The third factor, applying the <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> counterfactual (discussed below), which was misstated in para 27(iii) but must have been what Nicola Davies LJ intended to say, is that if the information which the defendant imparted had been correct, ie that Ms Meadows did not carry the haemophilia gene, the result would have been that the child would have been born with autism. Referring to Lord Reed&#8217;s judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Robinson v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2018/4" uk:canonical="[2018] UKSC 4" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] UKSC 4</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2018] AC 736" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] AC 736</ref>, para 27, Nicola Davies LJ stated that there was no need separately to consider whether the court&#8217;s decision was fair, just and reasonable in this case, which was not a novel case but involved the application of established legal principles.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Philip Havers QC for Ms Meadows challenged the judgment of the Court of Appeal and sought to uphold the reasoning of Yip J. He submitted that &#8220;the S<span style="font-style:italic">AAMCO</span> approach&#8221;, which was relevant to commercial transactions involving pure economic loss, was not suited to cases of clinical negligence in which there was an imbalance of knowledge and power between the clinician and the patient. He argued that Ms Meadows&#8217; claim should not be characterised as pure economic loss but as a mixed claim which combined her loss of autonomy through the continuation of the pregnancy and psychiatric damage incidental to her son&#8217;s disability as well as her claim for the cost of caring for A. It was also arbitrary and unfair to draw a distinction between a parent who did not want any pregnancy (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Parkinson</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Groom</span>) and a parent who did not want a particular pregnancy. Liability should be imposed because (a) A&#8217;s birth would not have happened but for the defendant&#8217;s mistake as Ms Meadows would have terminated the pregnancy on learning that her child carried the haemophilia gene and (b) (as agreed by the parties) the possibility that a baby might be born with autism was foreseeable. A&#8217;s autism was no less foreseeable than the child&#8217;s autism in <span style="font-style:italic">Parkinson</span> or the child&#8217;s bacterial meningitis in <span style="font-style:italic">Groom</span>. That sufficed to impose liability as the law took a broad view of the kind of damage that was foreseeable in cases involving personal damage: see for example <span style="font-style:italic">Jolley v Sutton London Borough Council</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2000] 1 WLR 1082" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2000">[2000] 1 WLR 1082</ref> (HL). Dr Khan&#8217;s failure to provide Ms Meadows with the necessary knowledge to enable her to make an informed decision to terminate a future pregnancy affected by the haemophilia gene was the feature which made her conduct wrongful and Ms Meadows&#8217; whole loss flowed from that feature. There was no intervening cause as A&#8217;s autism had an ante-natal cause. The court should bring cases of wrongful birth into line with cases in which clinical negligence causes direct physical injury and in which the <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> principle performs no limiting role. Cases of clinical negligence did not give rise to the risk of indeterminate liability which can arise in commercial cases involving pure economic loss.</p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> counterfactual had no role to play in the circumstances of this case in which the loss was directly related to the outcome of the birth when it had been Dr Khan&#8217;s duty to provide Ms Meadows with information to inform her decision whether to terminate a particular pregnancy affected by the haemophilia gene.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear that the components of the tort of negligence are interrelated and that there is no one generally accepted formula for analysing that interrelationship in a claim in negligence. Textbooks on negligence often identify four components or ingredients in the tort of negligence, namely, (i) the duty of care, (ii) its breach, (iii) causation of damage and (iv) the damage. For example, in <span style="font-style:italic">Clerk and Lindsell on Torts</span>, 23rd ed (2020), para 7-04, the authors list these ingredients as (1) the existence of a duty of care situation, (2) the breach of that duty by the defendant, (3) a causal connection between the defendant&#8217;s careless conduct and the damage and (4) the existence of a particular kind of damage to the particular claimant which is not so unforeseeable as to be too remote. The authors state: &#8220;There is no magic in the order as set out, nor should it be supposed that courts proceed from points (1) to (4) in sequence&#8221;. The authors of <span style="font-style:italic">Winfield and Jolowicz on Tort</span>, 20th ed (2020) suggest that the tort of negligence is constituted by those four elements which they place in order as (i) the duty of care, (ii) its breach, (iii) damage and (iv) causation (para 5-002). They point out that a given fact pattern can put several elements in issue simultaneously and that the elements are interlinked. They suggest that it is conventional for the courts to address the elements of the tort in sequence with the question of duty being a threshold question (para 5-007):</p>

Furthermore, the order in which the elements of the tort are considered is important because they form an integrated whole, in which one element can be defined and analysed only in terms of the other elements. For example, as questions of causation and remoteness concern the link between the breach of duty and the damage, it is important to look at fault and damage before looking at causation.&#8221;</p>

Lord Hobhouse went on to point out (p 209G) that Lord Hoffmann&#8217;s development of this reasoning in <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> was that &#8220;instead of applying it to kinds or categories of damage,&#8221; he &#8220;applied it to the <span style="font-style:italic">quantification</span> of damage&#8221; (emphasis in the original).

The matter is less straightforward where a scope of duty question arises in relation to the quantification of damages, as in <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span>, where there is a question whether part or all of the loss claimed was the consequence of the risk against which the defendant had to take care. In such circumstances, having identified the risks against which the defendant has undertaken to protect the claimant, the further question at stage 5 of our suggested sequence (the duty nexus question) addresses how the defendant&#8217;s scope of duty determines the extent of a defendant&#8217;s liability.</p>

The principle approved by the House was that the valuer owes no duty of care to the lender in respect of his entering into the transaction as such and that it is therefore insufficient, for the purpose of establishing liability on the part of the valuer, to prove that the lender is worse off than he would have been if he had not lent the money at all. &#8230; [I]n order to establish a cause of action in negligence he must show that his loss is attributable to the overvaluation, that is, that he is worse off than he would have been if it had been correct.</p>

There is in reality a spectrum and it is a matter of analysis of the particular circumstances of a case. In addressing the scope of duty question in the context of the provision of advice or information, the court seeks to identify the purpose for which that advice or information was given. Where the claimant has asked for advice about a risk or about a proposed activity which involved that risk, the court asks: &#8220;what was the risk which the advice or information was intended and was reasonably understood to address?&#8221; In addressing the scope of duty in relation to a transaction a distinction has been drawn between cases at either end of the spectrum. At one end is the case in which a professional adviser has undertaken to consider all of the material matters which should be taken into account in deciding whether to enter into the transaction, thereby guiding the whole decision-making process. At the other end is the case in which the professional adviser contributes only a very small part of the material on which the client will rely in making its decision whether to enter into the transaction. The spectrum lies in the extent of the matter, whether labelled information or advice, which the professional adviser has contributed to the claimant&#8217;s decision-making. Where the professional adviser is not guiding the whole decision-making process, the duty nexus question (question 5 discussed below) becomes of central importance because the court must separate out from the loss, which the claimant has suffered through entering the transaction, the element of that loss which is attributable to the defendant&#8217;s negligent performance of the service which he or she undertook. As Lord Sumption says (para 44): &#8220;[b]etween these extremes, every case is likely to depend on the range of matters for which the defendant assumed responsibility and no more exact rule can be stated.&#8221;</p>

Thus, if a driver of a car drives carelessly and injures a pedestrian who is walking on the pavement, the defendant driver breaches the duty of care which he or she owes to the pedestrian to avoid inflicting physical injury and is liable in damages for such injury and for the economic loss consequent upon the injury, such as loss of wages and costs of care. Similarly, if a surgeon negligently performs an operation and causes his or her patient to suffer pain, an extended period in hospital and similar consequent economic loss, the court will readily answer those questions in the affirmative.</p>

It was concerned with the allocation of risk in relation to a commercial transaction - the lending of money for the acquisition or development of commercial property. The professional valuer provides the would-be lender with important information as to the value of the property and that information is sometimes fundamental to the financial institution&#8217;s decision whether it will lend and, if it will, how much it will lend. But the financial institution takes into account other commercial considerations, such as its own assessment of likely trends in the property market, the strength of the borrower&#8217;s covenant, its own costs in providing the necessary funds to the borrower, and the appropriate rate of interest to charge. Where, having regard to the scope of the professional service which he or she has undertaken, it is concluded that the professional adviser is not to be treated as having taken responsibility for all the consequences of the commercial transaction (the scope of duty question), it is necessary to identify how much of the losses which the financial institution has sustained in the transaction fall within the responsibility of the defendant valuer.</p>

A duty of care which imposes upon the informant responsibility for losses which would have occurred even if the information which he gave had been correct is not in my view fair and reasonable as between the parties. &#8230; The principle thus stated distinguishes between a duty to <span style="font-style:italic">provide information</span> for the purpose of enabling someone else to decide upon a course of action and a duty to <span style="font-style:italic">advise</span> someone as to what course of action he should take.

The method which the court has adopted, is first to identify what Lord Nicholls described in <span style="font-style:italic">Nykredit</span> as &#8220;the basic measure&#8221; of the claimant&#8217;s loss and Lord Hobhouse in <span style="font-style:italic">Platform Home Loans</span> described as the &#8220;basic loss&#8221; which the claimant has suffered.

Because the valuer has not taken responsibility for the fluctuations in market value, but only for the consequences of the valuation being wrong, one must then identify from the &#8220;basic loss&#8221; the losses which fall within the scope of the valuer&#8217;s duty.</p>

We refer to that question as &#8220;the SAAMCO counterfactual&#8221;. It is sometimes misunderstood. The question is not whether the claimant would have behaved differently if the advice provided by the defendant had been correct. Rather, the counterfactual assumes that the claimant would behave as he did in fact behave and asks, whether, if the advice had been correct, the claimant&#8217;s actions would have resulted in the same loss. By this means, the court can ascertain the loss which is attributable to that information being wrong. In some circumstances, as in valuers&#8217; negligence, it is appropriate to use this counterfactual. In other circumstances, the scope of duty question may identify the fair allocation of risk between the parties without the use of this counterfactual.

The product of this analysis assists in the determination of the extent of the claimant&#8217;s entitlement to damages in accordance with the principle that the law in awarding damages seeks, so far as money can, to put the claimant in the position in which he or she would have been absent the defendant&#8217;s negligence. That principle, vouched by <span style="font-style:italic">Livingstone v Rawyards Coal Co</span> (1880) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="5 App Cas 25" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">5 App Cas 25</ref>, 39; (1880) 7R (HL) 1,7 and <span style="font-style:italic">Watson Laidlaw &amp; Co Ltd v Pott Cassels &amp; Williamson</span> 1914 SC (HL) 18, 29, is not the correct starting point of the analysis, as Lord Hoffmann stated in <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> (para 39 above): it is better to begin by considering the claimant&#8217;s cause of action.

In our view that novelty is confined to the accommodation of the scope of duty principle highlighted in <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> in a traditional analysis of the tort of negligence in a way that is consistent with principle. We respectfully disagree with Lord Burrows&#8217; judgment in two respects. The first matter is his emphasis on policy. While policy decisions may have influenced the extension of the scope of duty principle by its application to the quantification of loss, it is now an established principle which is to be applied and which does not now depend on issues of policy such as judgments whether it is fair and reasonable that it should be applied. The scope of duty principle as it has been developed in and since <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> is part of a wider question as to the defendant&#8217;s duty of care. Secondly, Lord Burrows&#8217; scheme at para 79 of his judgment assumes at the first and second stages that one can speak of a duty of care and its breach without determining the damage which is necessary to complete the tort of negligence. We prefer to anchor the scope of duty principle in the question as to the defendant&#8217;s duty of care, while recognising as we do (para 41 above) that in many cases the court, having established that the defendant was negligent in relation to at least some of the damage, will have to ask itself the duty nexus question in applying the scope of duty principle to the quantification of the claimant&#8217;s loss.</p>

It is therefore not relevant to its applicability whether a claim is characterised as one for economic loss consequent upon a physical injury or as pure economic loss. That distinction may on the other hand be relevant to the outcome of the application of the principle because in cases where there is a duty to take care to avoid causing physical injury, the economic loss consequent upon that injury will generally be within the scope of duty and will be recoverable if it is not excluded by the legal filters which we have described in our discussion of the sixth question.</p>

Where a surgeon negligently performs an operation and causes both physical injury and consequent economic loss to the patient, both types of loss will normally be within the scope of the defendant&#8217;s duty of care. In other words, by undertaking the operation on the patient the surgeon takes responsibility for physical harm caused by any lack of skill and care in performing the operation and for consequential economic loss. Similarly, when a general medical practitioner negligently prescribes unsuitable medication, thereby causing injury or failing to prevent the development of an otherwise preventable medical condition, both the injury or condition and the consequential economic loss will generally be within the scope of the defendant&#8217;s duty. The negligent care of a mother in the final stages of pregnancy can sadly have the result of the birth of a baby with brain damage and the defendant is normally liable to pay compensation for both the injury and the consequential additional cost of caring for the disabled child. In the <span style="font-style:italic">Parkinson</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Groom</span> cases the object of the service undertaken was to prevent the birth of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">any</span> child as in each case the mother did not want to have any more children. In <span style="font-style:italic">Parkinson</span> the service undertaken was to prevent a pregnancy while in <span style="font-style:italic">Groom</span> the task which should have been performed was to make sure that the mother was not pregnant notwithstanding her recent sterilisation. In both cases the added economic costs of caring for a disabled child, whatever his or her disability, were within the scope of the defendant&#8217;s liability because of the nature of the service which the defendant had undertaken. In none of those cases did the <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> counterfactual have a role to play. But it is necessary in every case to consider the nature of the service which the medical practitioner is providing in order to determine what are the risk or risks which the law imposes a duty on the medical practitioner to exercise reasonable care to avoid. That is the scope of duty question.</p>

That is because the absence of foreseeability would militate against there being a duty of care in relation to such a risk. But the foreseeability of such unrelated disability is in no sense determinative of the question of the scope of the duty of care. That is because the scope of duty question depends principally upon the nature of the service which the defendant has undertaken to provide to the claimant. One asks: &#8220;what is the risk which the service which the defendant undertook was intended to address?&#8221; Where a medical practitioner has not undertaken responsibility for the progression of the pregnancy and has undertaken only to provide information or advice in relation to a particular risk in a pregnancy, the risk of a foreseeable unrelated disability, which could occur in any pregnancy, will not as a general rule be within the scope of the clinician&#8217;s duty of care. Foreseeability is, of course, also relevant to the legal filters such as remoteness of damage, which arise once it has been established that the defendant&#8217;s duty of care extends beyond particular risks in the pregnancy.</p>

Secondly, the scope of duty question is answered by addressing the purpose for which Ms Meadows obtained the service of the general medical practitioners. She approached the general practice surgery for a specific purpose. She wished to know if she was a carrier of the haemophilia gene. Mr Havers accepted as accurate Nicola Davies LJ&#8217;s statement of the purpose of the consultation in para 27(i) of her judgment in the Court of Appeal:</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">Dr Khan owed her a duty to take reasonable care to give accurate information or advice when advising her whether or not she was a carrier of that gene. In this context it matters not whether one describes her task as the provision of information or of advice. The important point is that the service was concerned with a specific risk, that is the risk of giving birth to a child with haemophilia.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Thirdly, Dr Khan was in breach of her duty of reasonable care, as she readily admitted. Fourthly, as a matter of factual causation, Ms Meadows lost the opportunity to terminate the pregnancy in which the child had both haemophilia and autism. There was thus a causal link between Dr Khan&#8217;s mistake and the birth of A. But that is not relevant to the scope of Dr Khan&#8217;s duty. In this case, fifthly, the answer to the scope of duty question points to a straightforward answer to the duty nexus question: the law did not impose on Dr Khan any duty in relation to unrelated risks which might arise in any pregnancy. It follows that Dr Khan is liable only for the costs associated with the care of A insofar as they are caused by his haemophilia. One can also apply the <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> counterfactual as an analytical tool by asking what the outcome would have been if Dr Khan&#8217;s advice had been correct and Ms Meadows had not been a carrier of the haemophilia gene. The undisputed answer is that A would have been born with autism. Sixthly, given the purpose for which the service was undertaken by Dr Khan, and there being no questions of remoteness of loss, other effective cause or mitigation of loss, the law imposes upon her responsibility for the foreseeable consequences of the birth of a boy with haemophilia, and in particular the increased cost of caring for a child with haemophilia.</p>

In order to determine if she was a carrier of haemophilia, which could be passed on to her children, she should have been referred to a haematologist for genetic testing. It was negligent of the defendant not to advise the claimant that she required referral for genetic testing and, therefore, to lead her to believe that the results of the blood tests showed that she was not a carrier of haemophilia.</p>

In common with any mother considering pregnancy, as Nicola Davies LJ expressed it at para 27(ii), the claimant was taking upon herself &#8220;the risks of all other [ie non-haemophiliac-related] potential difficulties of the pregnancy and birth both as to herself and to her child.&#8221;</p>

If we ask the question, would the claimant have suffered the same loss had the information/advice been true, the answer is &#8220;yes&#8221; as regards the autism losses (so that the scope of the duty of care does not extend to the recovery of the autism losses) but &#8220;no&#8221; as regards the haemophiliac losses (so that the scope of the duty of care does extend to the recovery of the haemophiliac losses). This is because had the information/advice that the claimant was not a carrier of haemophilia been correct, the claimant would still have given birth to an autistic child but would not have given birth to a child with haemophilia. Applying the counterfactual test therefore supports the view that the autism losses were outside the scope of the doctor&#8217;s duty of care.</p>

For example, their approach does not appear to start with establishing a duty of care, sees the <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> principle as concerned with the &#8220;duty nexus&#8221; question, and treats contributory negligence alongside remoteness. As I have explained in para 73 above, there was no dispute in this case about a duty of care being owed, about there being a breach of that duty, and about factual causation. Nor, as I have mentioned in para 75, was there any issue about the loss being too remote, in the conventional <span style="font-style:italic">Wagon Mound</span> sense, or about legal causation.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As this approach is relatively conventional, I do not think it is necessary to extend this judgment by explaining each of the seven questions. Suffice it to say that the duty of care concept controls the boundaries of the tort of negligence and problematic areas include pure economic loss, psychiatric illness and omissions; legal causation, as distinct from remoteness, is focusing on whether intervening acts of the claimant, or third parties, or natural events, break the chain of causation (so that the breach is no longer an effective cause); the <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> principle as to whether the loss was within the scope of the duty of care falls to be considered as the sixth question; and defences include contributory negligence (which is a partial defence), voluntary acceptance of risk, illegality and limitation of actions. Questions (4)-(6) are closely related because they are all concerned with limitations on the recovery of factually caused loss: although generally regarded as different from each other, the same result may be reached by applying more than one of those three limitations (and, depending on the facts, the order in which one considers them may be largely a matter of convenience). I would add that what Lord Hodge and Lord Sales appear to treat as their first question - often labelled the question of &#8220;minimum actionable damage&#8221; (see Jane Stapleton, &#8220;The Gist of Negligence&#8221; (1988) 104 LQR 213) - can, in my view, be conveniently treated as a sub-issue under the duty of care enquiry (my first question).</p>

On the agreed facts, the only purpose for which the claimant, Ms Meadows, consulted the general practice of the defendant, Dr Khan, was to find out whether she was carrying a gene for haemophilia. That did not by itself limit the scope of the defendant&#8217;s duty, as a doctor&#8217;s duty will sometimes extend to addressing a matter on which the patient has not asked for advice but which the doctor recognises or ought to recognise poses a material risk to the patient. In this case, however, there is no finding that the defendant was or ought to have been aware of any fact which gave rise to a duty to advise the claimant about anything other than whether she was carrying a haemophilia gene. Accordingly, the duty owed by the defendant was limited to taking care to give the claimant accurate advice on that matter.</p>

Had appropriate tests been arranged and the claimant been told, as she should have been, that she was carrying a haemophilia gene, she would have undergone foetal testing during her pregnancy and would have terminated her pregnancy when she found out that she would otherwise give birth to a child with haemophilia.</p>

To do so is to treat an adviser who is negligent in relation to a particular matter as if the adviser had a responsibility to protect the claimant against risks unrelated to that matter.

The defendant had no duty to assess or advise the claimant about such other factors. It follows that the defendant is not responsible for all the foreseeable adverse consequences of any decision made in reliance on her negligent advice, but only for those which result from the matter which the defendant negligently misrepresented and which made the advice wrong - that is, the fact that the claimant was carrying a gene for haemophilia.</p>

I have also emphasised (at paras 128-129 of that judgment) that when such a test is applied the relevant question is not - as has sometimes mistakenly been supposed - whether, if the advice given by the defendant had been correct advice to give, the claimant would have acted differently. The question is whether, if the advice had been correct in the sense that the facts had been as the defendant represented them to be, the action taken by the claimant as a result of the defendant&#8217;s negligent advice would have caused the same injury.

This excursus touches on questions much debated by legal scholars which go far beyond the issues raised by this appeal and the appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">MBS</span>. Like Lord Burrows, I think it undesirable as well as unnecessary to engage in such an exercise. In particular, these appeals are concerned solely with the liability of professional persons for giving negligent advice. Ascertaining the scope of the defendant&#8217;s duty in such cases depends on identifying the matters relevant to a decision to be taken by the claimant which the defendant has undertaken responsibility for assessing and advising the claimant about. The extent of those matters may be defined by express agreement or, in the absence of such an agreement, is implied from the role of a doctor or other professional person as that role is conventionally understood (or in the case of an auditor prescribed by statute) and by the objective purpose of the advice (which, as discussed at para 160 of my judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">MBS</span>, is not necessarily coextensive with the purposes for which the claimant intends to rely on the advice). Whether or to what extent analogous considerations apply in other contexts, such as careless driving or the negligent performance of a surgical operation to take two examples mentioned in para 47 of the judgment of Lord Hodge and Lord Sales, is not a question which arises for decision or on which the court has heard any argument on these appeals.</p>

It is common ground between us that it is always necessary to determine whether (or to what extent) the claimant&#8217;s &#8220;basic loss&#8221; is within the scope of the defendant&#8217;s duty of care. Lord Hodge and Lord Sales call this &#8220;the duty nexus question&#8221; which they formulate as whether there is a sufficient nexus between the loss and the subject matter of the defendant&#8217;s duty. I understand the word &#8220;nexus&#8221; to be another term for what I refer to, more prosaically, as a causal connection. I agree with Lord Hodge and Lord Sales that there can be circumstances in which it is obvious that loss incurred by the claimant is wholly outside the scope of the defendant&#8217;s duty. There can also be cases, inaptly referred to in <span style="font-style:italic">SAAMCO</span> as involving the giving of &#8220;advice&#8221; rather than &#8220;information&#8221;, where the defendant&#8217;s duty encompasses all losses which satisfy other requirements such as foreseeability. In cases of either of these types no further or finer analysis is needed of whether or to what extent the loss was caused by a matter within the defendant&#8217;s area of responsibility which the defendant negligently misstated or failed to report.</p>

The subject matter of Dr Khan&#8217;s advice was limited to whether Ms Meadows was carrying a haemophilia gene and accordingly only losses causally connected (or, if the terminology is preferred, which have a sufficient nexus) to that subject matter are within the scope of the defendant&#8217;s duty. On the agreed facts, the losses caused by the fact that, as the defendant negligently failed to discover and report, the claimant was carrying a haemophilia gene are those associated with the haemophilia from which her child suffers and do not include costs associated only with his autism, which is causally unrelated. The appeal must therefore be dismissed.</p>
