Secondly, the tribunal did not consider in this connection the pain that the claimant said that he experienced from particular arm movements. </span></p>

It is implicit in the notion of dressing that it involves putting on a reasonable range of clothing that is appropriate in different circumstances, including for example warm clothing in cold seasons.  It does seem from the paragraph that I have quoted that the tribunal focused on a short-sleeved T shirt.  It is apparent that the tribunal found that the claimant could put on a T shirt without undue pain but they do not seem to have considered, for example, how the claimant might fare when working his arms into a long-sleeved garment.</span></p>
