The practice of the Upper Tribunal is to promulgate a composite judgment and order in judicial review cases.  The full judgment was not available at the stage when the hearings were completed.

The Applicant SASA is expected to be admitted tomorrow (22 June 2017).  As regards the Applicant MHA the Tribunal, in making a further extension of time order (today), has directed the Secretary of State to make a full evidential response via the twin media of a witness statement, to be made by a properly selected witness, and disclosure of all material documents, by 13.00 hours on 26 June 2017 [all four Applicants have now been admitted to the United Kingdom and have claimed asylum].</span>

These judgments differ according to the differing factual matrix of each individual case.  However, in their operative sections they are materially indistinguishable.  In all cases the Tribunal held that the Secretary of State&#8217;s initial decisions (belonging to the so-called &#8220;expedited process&#8221;), the decision making process and the perpetuation of such decisions via a continuing refusal to admit the Applicants to the United Kingdom were unlawful, in the following series of respects:</span>

<span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Irrespective of whether the Dublin Regulation and its sister instrument governed the expedited process, the Secretary of State acted unlawfully in operating a procedurally irregular and unfair decision making process: see </span>
<span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">AM</span>
<span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> at [116] &#8211; [129].  This latter conclusion is encapsulated in [129] of the judgment in </span>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">&#8220;To summarise, AM can lay claim to a series of procedural, or due process, protections and safeguards enshrined in three separate legal regimes: EU law, the Human Rights Act 1998 and the common law.  Based on the analysis, findings and conclusions set forth above he has been denied the safeguards identified.  The decision making process resulting in the Secretary of State&#8217;s original and continued refusal to admit him to the United Kingdom for the purpose of family reunification with AO was, for the reasons explained, irredeemably flawed.  It has, without legal justification, breached AM&#8217;s procedural rights. This applies irrespective of whether the Dublin Regulation governed the expedited process. AM&#8217;s challenge must succeed in consequence.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">&#8220;The expedited process in the group of five cases to which this challenge belongs was beset with procedural deficiencies and shortcomings and egregious unfairness.  These contaminants are either not contested or incontestable.  The conduct of the two interviews alone warrants a conclusion of procedural unfairness. The materiality of these procedural frailties is beyond plausible argument.  The acid question is whether these procedural irregularities can be excused on the basis of the humanitarian challenge and the need for expedition. These are the two factors on which the Secretary of State relies. These must be recognised as important considerations and we readily acknowledge the major challenge the two Governments concerned faced. However, we consider that the exercise of balancing them with all the other factors summarised below results in a resounding negative answer to the question posed.  Fundamentally, there was far too much at stake for these isolated and vulnerable children to warrant any other answer.&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">In the present litigation context we are bound to take into account that the &#8220;Calais expedited process&#8221; is done and dusted.  The Tribunal could, in theory, formulate a remedy requiring the Secretary of State&#8217;s officials to seek the permission of the French authorities for the purpose of travelling to the reception centre in France where AM is accommodated and conducting a procedurally fair and regular inquisition followed by all appropriate subsequent steps, which would include thorough enquiries of OA and his family circumstances. However this would entail delay and uncertainty, coupled with the imponderable of the necessary co-operation of the French authorities.  It would also be cumbersome and expensive.</span>

<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">[132]</span>
<marker name="tab"/>
<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">We take into account simultaneously the desirability of any remedial order not interfering with appropriate further best interests and child safeguarding checks and enquiries.  Given the inadequacies of enquiry and procedural defects which we have diagnosed, the outcome of such steps could, in principle, frustrate the family reunification aspirations of AM and OA.  While we attribute substantial weight to the evidence of the two protagonists, which we consider plausible, we must recognise that this will not necessarily be determinative of the ultimate outcome for both. </span>

<marker name="tab"/>
<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">The considerable delays to date must further be weighed.  In addition, each segment of continuing delay is plainly inimical to the Applicant&#8217;s best interests.  We also take into account that the immediate practical effect of AM&#8217;s admission to the United Kingdom will be his absorption within the statutory care system, without prejudice to a final decision.  Thus while on the one hand it would not achieve immediately his goal of family reunification, on the other this would protect his best interests while final checks and enquiries are completed. Furthermore, this step will enhance the prospects of a fresh decision making process which will respect his right to procedural fairness and other due process safeguards and guarantees and, simultaneously, facilitate the Secretary of State&#8217;s corresponding legal obligation. AM&#8217;s swift transfer to the United Kingdom would also be a positive step from the perspective of his mental health.&#8221;</span>

The Tribunal, in its judgments, found that the Secretary of State had acted unlawfully in a series of clearly identified respects.  I consider that, in its formulation of remedy, it was not necessary for the Tribunal to engage in an exercise of repetition.  The Secretary of State, arguably the most experienced and prolific of all public authority litigants in the United Kingdom and surrounded and bolstered by a posse of legal advisers, did not on any reasonable showing require this further cosseting in the text of the Tribunal&#8217;s judgment. Furthermore, the Secretary of State&#8217;s representatives did not delay in preparing an application for permission to appeal and were under no evident handicap in formulating their grounds.</span>

In its four judgments, the Tribunal spelled out clearly the legal shortcomings and deficiencies in the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision making processes.  It held that these were procedurally irregular and unfair.  Its conclusions were reflected in its orders.  In the context of the present applications, the spotlight falls on the second provision of each of the orders: see [4](2) above. In short the Secretary of State, duly educated and guided by the Tribunal&#8217;s judgments, was ordered to embark upon and complete a further, lawful decision making process culminating in fresh decisions.

Nor is there any material documenting the training and instructions, if any, given to interviewers and interpreters, with one limited exception which seems directed more to decision makers.  Furthermore, the evidential gaps thereby created have not, in many material instances, been rectified through the medium of witness statements.

In these circumstances, it became necessary for the Tribunal to order disclosure to it of the documents in unredacted form, accompanied by a witness statement explaining the reasons for the redactions.

Linked to this, there is an unavoidable concern that excessive time, effort and energy have been invested in communications of this kind when the focus should more properly have been on complying with reasonable requests for disclosure of documents and kindred requests.

I also reject the submission that a provision of this kind would be &#8220;unclear&#8221;.  I consider that mature, adult litigants who have a keen sense of the rule of law should not require kindergarten-type elaboration.    Good sense, good faith and reasonableness are the three stand out ingredients in complying with a provision of this kind.  In the world of contemporary litigation, there should be no requirement for subsequent judicial monitoring.  This is, however, available to cater for something unpredicted or unforeseeable.  In the abstract, and given the Tribunal&#8217;s experience of these cases, it would be highly surprising if the imposition of a requirement on the part of the Secretary of State&#8217;s officials and legal representatives to engage in appropriate communication with the Applicant&#8217;s legal representatives, in the interests of securing compliance with a judicial order, were to prove &#8220;onerous&#8221;.

It has failed to adhere to the high standards expected of government departments in judicial review litigation.  The allegiances owed by the Secretary of State to the court in public law proceedings arise out of a species of partnership.  The essential tenets of this partnership are that the public authority concerned will, figuratively, play its cards face up</span>
<span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> </span>
<span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">and the court, in turn, will be mindful of its supervisory (not appellate) jurisdiction, will accord such deference as is appropriate according to the context and will fashion remedies which respect the differing roles of the public authority as primary decision maker and the court as supervisory judicial authority.

At the time when this application was initiated, the Secretary of State had failed to comply with the time limit specified in (1) of the Tribunal&#8217;s several Orders and had, timeously, sought and received variations from the Tribunal whereby the time limit was extended.  The Tribunal&#8217;s principal Orders were, carefully and deliberately, framed in less than absolute terms which contemplated that the Secretary of State might be driven to seeking extensions of time.  It was implicit in the orders that reasonable extensions of time would be granted if good reason to do so were demonstrated.  In each of these cases, the Tribunal has been persuaded to extend time on the basis that good reason for doing so has been established.  It follows, logically, that there has been no breach by the Secretary of State of paragraph (1) of the principal Orders. </span>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.34in;margin-right:0.01in">The context in which the Tribunal made its decisions is important. This claim (Citizens UK) was issued in October 2016, and the Claimant's Amended Grounds (where they first sought to challenge the expedited process) were served in mid-January. At the hearing before Lang J on 28 February 2017, when permission was granted, there was substantial argument about the timetable. It was agreed by the Court that the case required expedition, but the necessity of the SSHD having a fair opportunity to present her evidence was also recognised. <img src="image7.jpeg" style="width:.75pt;height:1.5pt"/>Expedition was ordered, and the timetable that was set provided for a three-day hearing <img src="image8.jpeg" style="width:.75pt;height:.75pt"/> (including a reading day) beginning 22 May. The SSHD has put in a very considerable amount of work to prepare the SSHD's response in that timescale, and the Court has as a result the detailed evidence before it from very senior officials responsible for the expedited process.</p>

The SSHD made an application to have them stayed pending the imminent hearing in this case, but by its judgment dated 29 March 2017, the Tribunal refused that application, considering that to wait until after the hearing in Citizens UK "would impose a limitation serious impacting on the Applicants' right of access to a court", and that the Tribunal "reject[s] the argument of substantial judicial overlap <img src="image17.jpeg" style="width:3.75pt;height:3pt"/>(paragraph 28 of the judgment on the stay).</p>

Indeed the Tribunal made clear at the hearing of the AM case on 5 May 2017 that it wished counsel to address it on the procedural aspects of the claim. Given that this inevitably would involve the same issues at the Citizens UK claim, the SSHD renewed her application for a stay behind Citizens UK which the Tribunal refused. The Tribunal then heard submissions made almost exclusively with reference to the bundle <img src="image18.jpeg" style="width:.75pt;height:.75pt"/>in Citizens UK for the rest of that day and there was not time for Counsel for the SSHD to make any submissions on that day. </p>

The impropriety of the allegation of carelessness and what follows in [9] below require no elaboration.

The High Court is invited to consider the legal questions carefully and independently. Of necessity, the grounds of appeal in the Tribunal cases focus on the most important errors, and those which go directly to the Tribunal's conclusions, but it is emphasised that the SSHD fundamentally disagrees with the Tribunal's approach on almost all aspects of this case.</p>

<span style="font-size:11pt">The Tribunal appears to have entirely overlooked the fact that the process operated without prejudice to the Dublin Ill Regulation. The process fast-tracked a substantial group of children who could be readily and confidently identified as meeting the criteria in question, but that for all children remaining in France, they retained full access to the Dublin procedure, and were essentially in the same position as those unaccompanied asylum-seeking children elsewhere in France and Europe. This error then fed into the Tribunal's key conclusions. The Tribunal asserted, for example, that the standards of fairness that it required were because the decisions involved "the making of life changing and destiny shaping decisions for the children involved", seemingly unaware that the underlying position of the children not transferred under this process was not determined: the right to consideration of a take-charge request under the Dublin Ill Regulation from France being unaffected. </span>

<span style="font-size:11pt">In respect of the ''filter" process that was followed following completion of Operation Purnia Phase 2, the Tribunal apparently considered that there was no '(clear evidence" of the nature of this, seemingly unaware of paragraph 69 of Mr Cook's statement, and 70-77 of Ms Farman's statement. This is one of a number of instances </span>
