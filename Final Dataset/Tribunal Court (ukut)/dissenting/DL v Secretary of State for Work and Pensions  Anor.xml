      <p>Child Support Act 1991: What has to be in place for the Court to recognise that a supersession decision has been made under s17 of the Child Support Act 1991 (in circumstances where the decision making is unclear and confused).    What happens if this decision does not comply with Regulation 25 of the Child Support Maintenance Regulations 2012 &#8211; does that mean the decision is totally invalid or can the Tribunal examine the manner and extent of the deficiencies and the prejudice to the parties when deciding if the notification was invalid.  </p>

      <p>In cases of confused or unclear decision making, what requirements are essential for something to amount to a supersession decision under s17 of the Child Support Act 1991.  Whether the requirements of Regulation 25 of the Child Support Maintenance Regulation 2012  are such that failure to comply with the requirements automatically makes the decision totally invalid, or can the Tribunal examine the manner and extent of the deficiencies and the prejudice to the parties when deciding if the notification was invalid or simply deficient (and so can be relied upon as a decision which can be the subject of appeal).  </p>

The appeal had been brought to the First Tier Tribunal (&#8220;FTT&#8221;) by the Second Respondent against the refusal by the CMS to add her son C to the child maintenance assessment which already existed for her other son, who I shall call CN by decisions made on 5 February 2021 and 22 July 2021.

Counsel for the First Respondent, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions apologised on behalf of the Child Maintenance Service for the manner in which this case had been decided at the hearing.  Neither the Appellant or the Second Respondent were responsible for the confusion and catalogue of failings demonstrated by this case.  They should be commended for their forbearance during this protracted process.  The Second Respondent was distressed by the length of time that this case had taken and by dealing with what has turned out to be a case of some procedural complexity.  She told me that her mental health had been significantly affected by the continuation of this case.  I hope that the CMS will seek to avoid the mistakes seen here recurring.  </span></p>

This is important as the Second Respondent was therefore not asking for a maintenance calculation to be made (<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/11" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48 s. 11" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s11</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Child Support Act 1991</ref> (CSA) ) but for it to be superseded under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48/section/17" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48 s. 17" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s17</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1991/48" uk:canonical="1991 c. 48" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">CSA 1991</ref>). This is because there had been a change of circumstances to add another &#8220;qualifying child&#8221; from October 2020.  CMS records show that she said she phoned in October 2020 when speaking with them on 18 January 2021.  On 18 January 2021, CMS note that the Second Respondent telephoned and asked for C to be added to the child maintenance claim.  She informed the CMS that he was in full time education.  There is dispute between the Appellant and the Second Respondent as to exactly when C was in full time education but that is not an issue upon this appeal.  She also said that she was waiting for a child benefit claim to be processed.   Child Benefit was awarded to the Second Respondent from either 2 November 2020 or from 22 February 2021 (there are two dates on information obtained by CMS from HMRC who administered child benefit).   A record from the CMS on 19 January 2021 recorded this report as a new qualifying child in a parent with care household. </span></p>

I can see that there could be some cases where the background circumstances and facts could show that all the relevant information had been supplied to the parents but just in different formats at different times, and that if for example the number of qualifying children and relevant other children is a matter of common knowledge, that would not be fatal to a defective notification.  It is, as ever, a difference between substance and form &#8211; and in this case the substance was not there.  </span></p>

I consider, given the length of time that this litigation has been ongoing, the vulnerability of the Second Respondent and the need for finality in litigation that sending this case back to the First Tier Tribunal would not be fair or consistent with the overriding objective.  I do not agree with the First Respondent&#8217;s submission that the matter should be remitted to consider the issue of prejudice and what the consequences of non-compliance should be in all the circumstances.  I consider that it is inevitable that any First Tier Tribunal would find that the nature of the non-compliance was so significant that it was, in fact invalid rather than simply defective.  I would therefore, if I did consider that there was jurisdiction to hear this appeal, have determined that I should allow the appeal and remake the decision.  </span></p>
