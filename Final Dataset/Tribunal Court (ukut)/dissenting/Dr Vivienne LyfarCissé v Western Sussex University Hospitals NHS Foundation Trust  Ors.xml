	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Unfair Dismissal, Victimisation, &amp; Whistleblowing, Protected Disclosures</span></p>
	    <p>Where the employer had dismissed the Claimant after re-opening previously a concluded disciplinary process which had led to a final written warning, the Employment Tribunal was right to find that the reason for dismissal could be characterised as either conduct or Some Other Substantial Reason, and that the essential question was that posed by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/18/section/98/4" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 98(4)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/18" uk:canonical="1996 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">ERA 1996</ref> of whether the dismissal was fair in all the circumstances. In so deciding, it did not fail to deal with the complaint that the employer had failed to apply its own disciplinary policy. </p>
	    <p>The Employment Tribunal&#8217;s finding that protected acts or protected disclosures were not the reason why the employer treated the Claimant as it did was not undermined by a failure to deal expressly with one contention that managers in a comparable situation but without a history of protected acts or protected disclosures had been treated more favourably. </p>
	    <p>Although there were some factual inaccuracies or errors of expression in a further decision of the Employment Tribunal on reconsideration, new evidence adduced on the reconsideration was not capable of supporting the Claimant&#8217;s case and the decision to refuse reconsideration was correct.</p>

R2 is a NHS Trust running two principal hospitals, in Brighton and Hayward&#8217;s Heath. The Appellant is a clinical biochemist. In October 2014 she became R2&#8217;s Associate Director of Transformation. She has held a number of positions with responsibilities for improving race equality for employees and NHS service users. She was also the Chair of the R2&#8217;s BME Network, whose role she described as &#8220;the promotion of good race relations and the elimination of racial discrimination for employees and health service users&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">In 2016 the Appellant was the subject of disciplinary proceedings. These were based on a total of 19 allegations. Some 17 of these came from two different individuals, and the other two concerned a failure to participate in an investigation conducted by Henrietta Hill QC (as she then was). The outcome was set out in a letter from Rachel Cashman, Director of Strategy and Commercial Development, dated 11 November 2016. Ms Cashman upheld (1) three allegations made by a Ms B, of breaching confidentiality, bullying and victimising her by seeking to interfere with the investigation of a grievance brought by her about alleged discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation, (2) an allegation that the Appellant discriminated against a Mr W by making a negative remark about him because he is white and acting in a way amounting to harassment relating to his race; and (3) an allegation that the Appellant failed to comply with a reasonable instruction to participate in the investigation of Ms Hill QC. A final written warning was issued, valid for 12 months. An appeal was rejected on 4 January 2017. </p>

In a report dated 17 August 2016, the overall finding was that R2 was &#8220;inadequate&#8221;, and it was rated as inadequate in the area of leadership. The CQC&#8217;s report referred to bullying, harassment and discrimination being &#8220;rife in the organisation&#8221; and found that BME staff felt there was a &#8220;culture of fear&#8221;. It also referred to a &#8220;fractured and damaged approach to equality and diversity&#8221; and to the need for &#8220;cultural change&#8221;. </p>

On 23 February 2017 she sent an email to R2&#8217;s HR director, expressing shock that the Appellant was &#8220;back in her role of race equality lead&#8221;. A further and similar email on 2 March 2017 was copied to Evelyn Barker, who had become interim CEO of R2 on 23 January 2017. Eventually Mrs Barker met Ms B on 29 March 2017. Ms B told her about the outcome of her complaint and said that she was very upset that the Appellant was still in a leadership position. </p>

In her email Mrs Barker referred to the CQC&#8217;s findings relating to the leadership of R2 and noted that the findings against the Appellant called into question &#8220;her ability to have a leadership role on equality issues&#8221; and whether &#8220;there are fit and proper person issues that we are required to address&#8221;. </p>

Dr Findlay wrote to the Appellant on 25 April 2017 to request the meeting, to discuss whether it was &#8220;tenable for you to continue in your current role with responsibility for providing leadership on important equality issues&#8221; and to consider the fit and proper person requirement under the 2014 Regulations. </p>

The Appellant was accompanied by a trade union representative, Mr Valle. Dr Findlay produced a report dated 24 May 2017.

Her letter stated that Dr Findlay would attend to present his report, that the Appellant could ask questions of him, comment on the report, state and argue her own case, call witnesses, present written evidence and be accompanied by a trade union representative or colleague who could make representations and ask questions on her behalf. The Appellant was in fact represented again by Mr Valle. Mrs Griffiths stated that at that meeting she found the Appellant to be &#8220;defiant and combative&#8221;. </p>

Mrs Griffiths concluded that the Appellant&#8217;s role fell within the scope of regulation 5. She also found that the Appellant&#8217;s ability to perform her leadership role was &#8220;fatally undermined by having been found to have acted in the way you have&#8221;. She had therefore decided to terminate the Appellant&#8217;s employment as Associate Director of Transformation with three months&#8217; notice. The Appellant would be eligible for redeployment although, in the event, she was not offered any alternative position. </p>

The claimants were social workers who had responsibility for a young child who was on the child protection register but who died in August 2007. They were given written warnings under the council&#8217;s simplified disciplinary procedure for failings in the handling of the case. In November 2008 the child&#8217;s mother and two other individuals were convicted of causing or allowing his death. The Secretary of State for Education commissioned a report on the council&#8217;s safeguarding and then directed a change of director of children&#8217;s services and further investigations. In 2009, fresh disciplinary proceedings were instituted against the claimants, who this time were summarily dismissed for gross misconduct. They brought claims of unfair dismissal, principally on the ground that they should not have been disciplined twice for the same matter. The ET by a majority rejected their claim and its decision was upheld by this Tribunal. Dismissing their further appeals, the Court of Appeal ruled that doctrines such as <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata </span>or abuse of process do not apply to employers&#8217; disciplinary procedures so as to bar a second disciplinary process. The question for an ET would be whether it was fair to institute the second process (though this was essentially the same question as whether doing so was an abuse of process).

These were powerful points but they were obviously considered by the majority not to be a sufficient basis for establishing unfairness. Paragraph 27 then gives the majority's view; it seems to me that the majority is there saying that the justification for reopening the case lay in the fact that the allegations of misconduct were very serious because they involved a risk to a member of the public, and that new management were entitled to take a different view about the gravity of the conduct. In my judgment this was a proper and sufficient basis for the majority's conclusion that the dismissals were fair notwithstanding that the double jeopardy principle was infringed.&#8221;</p>

One way of looking at it is that in the widest sense the dismissal was related to the conduct of the Claimant (and therefore a reason within section 92(1)(b)) because of the findings made by Ms Cashman of unlawful conduct under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref>. Another more subtle concept is that the reason was the incompatibility of the Claimant&#8217;s role with the findings which had been made in the earlier disciplinary proceeding, that being SOSR. It was the latter which was urged on us by Mr Kibling. </p>

This, she argued, showed that her dismissal was predetermined and that it occurred because she had previously brought ET claims (or made protected disclosures) and therefore amounted to victimisation. </p>

She also makes some other criticisms of the ET&#8217;s reasoning, and indeed accuses the ET of being dishonest in some of its findings in that judgment, and cites these in support of her perversity argument. </p>

	    <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">In our judgment, the contents of the article simply do not assist the Appellant and could not have strengthened her case. In the quoted passage, Mrs Griffiths says that she inherited a situation of poor race relations including several tribunal claims. That was true. She then says that, to improve the situation, the Trust had to act bravely, even if doing so led to more tribunal claims. The clear meaning of that passage was that the Trust had to act bravely to discipline or dismiss those who contributed to poor race relations. Better relations presumably would mean fewer tribunal claims in future. The passage obviously did not mean that the Trust should act to the detriment of those who had brought claims in the past.</p>
