	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Mr Achilles Macris&#8217;s complaint is that without giving him a chance to make representations in his own defence, the Financial Conduct Authority has published a notice imposing a penalty on his former employer for various irregularities in the conduct of its business, in terms which identify him as the person responsible. The question at issue on this appeal is whether the notices in question did in fact identify him. This may look like a small point but, for reasons which I shall explain, it has significant implications for the conduct of the Authority&#8217;s investigatory and disciplinary functions.</p>

This includes protecting and enhancing the integrity of the United Kingdom financial system and ensuring the stability and orderly functioning of financial markets. The Authority&#8217;s powers are derived from the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/8" uk:canonical="2000 c. 8" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Financial Services and Markets Act 2000</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/8" uk:canonical="2000 c. 8" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>&#8221;), as amended by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/21" uk:canonical="2012 c. 21" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Financial Services Act 2012</ref>.</p>

In 2012 Mr Macris was the Bank&#8217;s International Chief Investment Officer. In that capacity, he was the head of a unit of the Bank in London called the Chief Investment Office (or &#8220;CIO International&#8221;). The function of CIO International was to manage the firm&#8217;s excess deposits, including a portfolio of traded credit instruments called the Synthetic Credit Portfolio. Mr Macris&#8217;s own functions were &#8220;controlled functions&#8221; for the purpose of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/21/section/59" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 59</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/21" uk:canonical="2012 c. 21" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>, which meant that he had to be approved by the Authority as a suitable person to carry on those functions.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In July 2012, the Bank announced that the Synthetic Credit Portfolio had lost $5.8 billion in the first half of the year, a figure which rose to $6.2 billion by the end of the year. Following an investigation, the Authority concluded that the loss was caused by a high risk trading strategy, weak management of that trading and an inadequate response to important information which should have alerted the Bank to the problems. It also concluded that the Bank had withheld significant information from the Authority while the losses were being incurred. Together, these failings were found to have undermined trust and confidence in UK financial markets. A regulatory settlement was agreed with the Bank, under which it paid a penalty of &#163;137,610,000.</p>

The normal form of these notices is a brief statement of the action proposed, followed by a fairly extensive narrative entitled &#8220;Reasons&#8221;. Where a regulatory settlement is agreed before the service of any of these notices, they must still be given, but the practice is to draft them in identical terms and serve them simultaneously. In this case the three notices were all served on the Bank on 18 September 2013. The Authority is not required to publish a warning notice to the world, but it is required to publish a decision notice and a final notice. It did so in this case on the following day, 19 September 2013.</p>

As an &#8220;approved person&#8221; he was personally under investigation along with his employer. But he was not party to the settlement with the Bank, and the investigation of his conduct was still in progress at the time. Ultimately, in February 2016, Mr Macris reached his own regulatory settlement. A final notice in relation to him was published on 9 February 2016, in which he was found to have been party to the withholding of information from the Authority and on one occasion to have misled it. A penalty of &#163;762,900 was imposed on him.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Authority does not deny that if Mr Macris was identified in the warning and decision notices served on the Bank, there were statements in those notices which were prejudicial to him. Their case is that he was not identified. It is common ground that he was not identified by name or job title. But there were many references to conduct by &#8220;CIO London management&#8221; or similar expressions. Mr Macris was not the only manager in CIO International in London. On the basis of the notice alone, therefore, &#8220;CIO London management&#8221; could have referred to a number of people other than him. His case is that those who were active in the relevant markets would have known that it referred to him. In support of this case, he produced two witness statements in the Upper Tribunal, neither of which was challenged. One was from a senior manager formerly employed in CIO International in London, who said that it was clear to him that &#8220;CIO London management&#8221; referred to Mr Macris. This was because of the knowledge that he had acquired as a manager in the same unit. In particular, he knew that Mr Macris was the head of that unit and was not in the habit of sharing his responsibilities with others. The other witness was a senior sales representative dealing in credit instruments for another bank in London. He said that he drew the same conclusion because he knew about Mr Macris&#8217;s position and working methods from his dealings with CIO International. In addition, Mr Macris relied on the fact that some five months before the service of the notices on the Bank, a US Senate Committee had published a report on the losses in the Bank&#8217;s Synthetic Credit Portfolio, which described his role in the incurring and treatment of those losses, identifying him by name. This report was available on the internet. It was said that if read side by side with the Authority&#8217;s notices the Senate Committee report would enable anyone to deduce who was being referred to as &#8220;CIO London management&#8221;.</p>

Judge Herrington upheld Mr Macris&#8217;s complaint and held that he was.

CIO also had its own Risk, Finance and VCG functions, which were control functions relevant to the SCP and other portfolios within CIO.

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;45.<marker name="tab"/>In my view the drafting of para 4.3 is inconsistent with how a corporation would describe the hierarchy of its governing bodies. Collective bodies are <span style="font-style:italic">responsible </span>for the management of particular business units rather than managing them themselves and the bodies concerned would appoint named individuals to carry out the actual management in clearly defined reporting lines. What therefore comes across clearly from para 4.3 of the Final Notice is a description of the reporting lines of particular individuals to their line managers. The paragraph also discloses the fact that SCP management would manage rather than be purely responsible for the management of the individual traders who would therefore each say that their line manager was whoever was identified as SCP management. It is not the practice that an individual trader would report to a collection of individuals; it is the hallmark of good management that there can be no confusion over which individual a<span style="font-style:italic"/>person reports to - he needs to know who his boss is and so he does not get conflicting messages. The reference to CIO London management being the most senior level of management for the SCP in London is also significant; again a reader with experience of how large corporations operate would take such a reference as being to the most senior individual concerned.</p>

	    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">46.<marker name="tab"/>This initial impression that the reader would take from para 4.3 is reinforced by the fact that CIO London management is stated in the notice to have performed actions such as having conversations, attending meetings and sending e-mails which can only be taken in the context in which these events are described, as being the actions of an individual rather than a body of persons. This is clearly apparent from the references Mr Herberg referred me to as set out in para 16 above.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">In the Court of Appeal Gloster LJ delivered the leading judgment, Patten LJ agreeing with her generally and Longmore LJ agreeing &#8220;to the extent that it is a question of law&#8221;. Gloster LJ declined (paras 52, 60) to adopt Judge Herrington&#8217;s reasoning but agreed with him in the result, namely that the references to &#8220;CIO London management&#8221; were references to &#8220;an individual, ascertained by reference solely to the terms of the notice itself&#8221; (para 52). She also considered (para 53) that the evidence adduced by Mr Macris and publicly available material such as the US Senate Committee report entitled the judge &#8220;to conclude, on an objective basis, that persons acquainted with Mr Macris, or who operated in his area of the financial services industry, would reasonably have been able to identify Mr Macris from the statements made in the notice.&#8221; Gloster LJ&#8217;s view that the relevant audience was &#8220;persons acquainted with Mr Macris, or who operated in his area of the financial services industry&#8221; was based on an analogy, which she regarded as persuasive, between disclosure under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/21/section/393" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 393</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/21" uk:canonical="2012 c. 21" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> and publication in the law of defamation.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">This appeal turns on the meaning of &#8220;identifies&#8221; and on the meaning of the notice to which that word is being applied. Both are questions of law, although the answers may be informed by background facts. The essential question before us is what background facts may be relevant for this purpose. In my opinion, a person is identified in a notice under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/21/section/393" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 393</ref> if he is identified by name or by a synonym for him, such as his office or job title. In the case of a synonym, it must be apparent from the notice itself that it could apply to only one person and that person must be identifiable from information which is either in the notice or publicly available elsewhere. However, resort to information publicly available elsewhere is permissible only where it enables one to interpret (as opposed to supplementing) the language of the notice. Thus a reference to the &#8220;chief executive&#8221; of the X Company may be elucidated by discovering from the company&#8217;s website who that is. And a reference to &#8220;CIO London Management&#8221; would be a relevant synonym if it could be shown to refer to one person and that person so described was identifiable from publicly available information. What is not permissible is to resort to additional facts about the person so described so that if those facts and the notice are placed side by side it becomes apparent that they refer to the same person. I reach this conclusion for the following reasons.</p>

It is common for notices to be served on different parties to the same investigation at different times. The possibility is expressly envisaged in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/21/section/393" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 393</ref> itself. The role of the firm or of the various individuals involved may take more or less long to investigate. Or, as happened in this case, one of them may settle before the others. Once the facts relating to one person or firm under investigation are ascertained or admitted and are found to justify criticism or sanctions, there will often be no proper reasons for withholding that information from the market. Yet there will almost always be people in the know, who will realise when they read the notices which individuals are encompassed by apparently anodyne collective expressions such as &#8220;management&#8221; or who is likely to have been responsible for particular failings of the firm. The facts, or enough of them, may be well known within the firm. They may be deduced by those who know enough about the firm&#8217;s procedures or organisational structure or the business methods of the &#8220;third party&#8221; in question. Even for those who are further from the scene, the internet is a fertile source of information and gossip for those who are willing to go to some trouble to discover his identity. The Authority will not necessarily know what if any further information about the business, the facts or the individuals involved may be available to knowledgeable outsiders or discoverable from publicly available sources. In those circumstances it must be able to ensure, by the way in which it frames its own notices, that a third party is not &#8220;identified&#8221; in the notice, even if he or she is identifiable from information elsewhere. The present case is a good illustration of the problem. The Court of Appeal considered that the information relevant for the purpose of identifying Mr Macris included the US Senate Report, which identified him by name. On that footing, once the Senate Committee had published his report, it would have been impossible for the Authority to serve the notice on JP Morgan as part of the settlement process, without serving a copy on Mr Macris at a comparatively early stage of the investigation of his role, when it would not necessarily know the relevant facts or have formulated any criticisms.</p>

Publication is not automatic. Where the Authority decides to publish, it does so in order to serve the public interest in the proper performance of its functions and the protection of those who use the financial services industry. This is reflected in the Authority&#8217;s <span style="font-style:italic">Enforcement Guide</span> (2016), section 6.2.16 of which states:</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Finally, I do not regard the suggested analogy with the law of defamation as helpful. The law imposes strict liability for the publication of a defamatory statement which reflects on the claimant, even if the defendant did not intend it to refer to the claimant and had no reason to believe that others would connect it with him. The test is whether those to whom the statement was published would reasonably suppose him to be the person referred to. That will commonly depend on who it was published to and what knowledge they had of him. In that context, extrinsic evidence is naturally available to connect the perception of the claimant among those to whom the defamatory statement was published with the person referred to in it. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/21/section/393" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 393</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2012/21" uk:canonical="2012 c. 21" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref> has an entirely different purpose.

Nor do I accept Mr Macris&#8217;s argument that because the notices referred to actions such as making statements, attending meetings or sending e-mails, which must have been done by individuals, a single individual is meant, as opposed to any of a number of individuals comprised within the term &#8220;the firm&#8221;, &#8220;CIO&#8221; or &#8220;CIO management&#8221;. The real question is whether the terms of the notice itself would have conveyed to a reasonable member of the public without extrinsic information that any of these terms was a synonym for Mr Macris. Plainly it would not. I would therefore allow the appeal and declare that Mr Macris was not a third party for the purposes of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/8/section/393" uk:canonical="2000 c. 8 s. 393" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 393</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/8" uk:canonical="2000 c. 8" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Financial Services and Markets Act 2000</ref>.</p>

I do not say this by way of complaint. In some cases, Parliament may consider that it is better for the legislature to lay down a rule in fairly unspecific terms in a statute, and then leave it to the courts to determine the precise extent and reach of the rule by reference to specific sets of facts. This appears to be such a case.</p>

The interests of the addressee of a notice who is accused of failings, and those of a third party such as an employee of the addressee, who may be identifiable as responsible for, or implicated in, the alleged failings, are by no means necessarily aligned. Thus, it may well be that an employer would want to try and curtail any publicity about the alleged failings by quickly negotiating and paying a penalty, even if there may be grounds for challenging the allegation in whole or in part. But this may often not suit the employee, who might well feel that, in the absence of the Tribunal exonerating him, his reputation, and therefore his future employment prospects, could be severely harmed or even ruined.</p>

The language used appears to stipulate that the person must be identified in the notice, not that he must be identifiable as a result of the notice.

(And, depending on the facts, the same might be the case with a reference to the Chairman of the Board of a foreign-registered company). It is true that even that form of identification would require the reader to have some outside knowledge, but as a matter of ordinary language, I would accept that an individual is &#8220;identified&#8221; in a document if (i) his position or office is mentioned, (ii) he is the sole holder of that position or office, and (iii) reference by members of the public to freely and publicly available sources of information would easily reveal the name of that individual by reference to his position or office.</p>

A test that was satisfied by reference to a specific and smaller group would give rise to difficulties as to where one should draw the line as a matter of principle, and also as to how in practice the Authority could know whether or not an individual satisfies the statutory test. The second essential feature is that, in order to satisfy the test, any research or investigation should be straightforward and simple, as would be the case in relation to identifying who chairs the board of a UK-registered company. In order to qualify, any investigation process should not require any detective work; and so jigsaw identification, ie &#8220;correctly identifying someone as a result of relating separate snippets of information&#8221; (<span style="font-style:italic">Donald v Ntuli</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2011] 1 WLR 294" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2011">[2011] 1 WLR 294</ref>, para 55), would not do. Similarly, the fact that Mr Macris could be identified by reference to a publicly available US Senate Committee report would not do because a member of the public would not know of that report, and anyway would not think of referring to it for the purpose of identifying Mr Macris as the individual referred to in the Notice in this case.</p>

However, his solution appears to me to give rise to problems which support adhering to the conclusion I have expressed. First, if a wider meaning than that which I have suggested is given to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/8/section/393/1" uk:canonical="2000 c. 8 s. 393" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 393(1)</ref>(a), it would be a matter of subjective assessment as to how wide a scope to give it. Secondly, any wider definition, unless it is very much wider than anyone has so far suggested, could self-evidently lead to disputes. Thirdly, a wider meaning could lead to some rather odd consequences. Fourthly, a wider definition would put the Authority in a difficulty from the start. Fifthly, a wider definition could still lead to arbitrary outcomes.</p>

Secondly, there could also easily be disagreements, which would have to be resolved, as to whether, on disputed or agreed facts, a particular person falls within that expression. Thirdly, as the facts of this case show, it may well be that Mr Macris could only have satisfied Lord Wilson&#8217;s test because of the happenstance that he had been identified in a published US Senate Committee report on various problems encountered by the Bank. Fourthly, these very facts highlight the difficulties which the Authority could face if one gives <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2000/8/section/393/1" uk:canonical="2000 c. 8 s. 393" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 393(1)</ref>(a) a wide meaning. Fifthly, even on Lord Wilson&#8217;s test, where a group of two people is identifiable from a Notice, it could be damaging to both of them if they could not clear their names, yet unless one of them could be identified, neither of them would be within the section.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">On the question of law, it is tempting to take the very broad view that it is unfair if a person like Mr Macris is not given the opportunity to address criticisms in a final decision notice directed, as this was, to Mr Macris&#8217;s current employers, JP Morgan Chase Bank NA, in terms which future employers might be able to ascertain by due diligence or investigation were in reality critical of Mr Macris.

The dictionary is one aspect of publicly available information, and, once it is permissible to look at that aspect of publicly available information to supply the identity of a person who is being criticised in a notice, I am unclear why this should not, for example, also be permissible to show that a generic description such as &#8220;CIO London management&#8221; in a notice in fact describes only one person. In my view, the correct analysis is, rather, along the lines of the Authority&#8217;s primary case, viz that a matter (only) &#8220;identifies&#8221; a person if the identity of the person is apparent from the terms in which the matter is described or explained, read in the light of information generally or publicly available in the financial world (as distinct from information available only to persons acquainted with the person or his company).</p>

It was &#8220;not a question of whether any particular type of reader could identify the individual concerned but simply whether there is information in the public domain that incontrovertibly links the description in the Final Notice&#8221; to, in this case, Mr Macris (para 50). Judge Herrington considered (in my view, probably incorrectly) that this analysis was consistent with that adopted by an earlier Financial Services and Markets Tribunal decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Watts v Financial Services Authority</span> FIN/2004/0024 (unreported) 7 September 2005.

It disagreed with the breadth of Judge Herrington&#8217;s approach at the second stage of his two-stage approach. It said that &#8220;there cannot be <span style="font-style:italic">ex post facto </span>unlimited reference to external material to identify the third party&#8221;, and that identification could only be made by reference to information &#8220;which objectively would be known by persons acquainted with the third party, or persons operating in the relevant area of the financial services market&#8221; (para 50). It is notable, however, that, in the next paragraph of its judgment, the Court of Appeal referred to what such persons &#8220;might reasonably have known&#8221;. Further, in para 51, after noting, correctly in my view, that the failure of the press to identify Mr Macris before his present claim was of some evidential relevance, the Court of Appeal only upheld the judge&#8217;s conclusion on the basis that &#8220;had he applied the objective test [which the Court of Appeal] formulated, [he] would have been entitled to conclude on the evidence before him, that despite the fact that the press had not previously latched on to the matter, the relevant sector of the financial market would nonetheless have appreciated that it was Mr Macris who was identified in the Notice as &#8216;CIO London management&#8217;&#8221;. Once it had concluded that Judge Herrington had applied the wrong test, it was for the Court of Appeal itself to apply the right test, not to consider whether a judge applying the correct text might reasonably have arrived at the same result or would have been entitled to do so.</p>

I also consider (contrary to the view taken in both courts below) that a notice cannot be said to identify an individual merely because persons acquainted with him or his company could do so. Otherwise, it would be necessary in almost every case for a third party notice to be given. The test of identification should have regard to information generally available publicly, without inquiry of those with direct knowledge of the company involved or detailed investigation, to those in the relevant financial world in which the matter occurred. A notice will, in my view, only identify an individual if it does so to persons operating in that world, unacquainted with the particular individual or his company, though familiar with information generally available publicly to operators in that world.</p>

In disagreement with Lord Wilson on this point, I do not consider that it follows that CIO London management equated with Mr Macris, or that he was the only relevant individual in CIO London management or that the criticisms directed generically at CIO London management were being directed at him.

In the warning and decision notices given to the bank on 18 September 2013, the Authority referred in detail to a telephone call on 10 April 2012 which it had conducted with &#8220;CIO London management&#8221;. In fact it had conducted the call with (or primarily with) Mr Macris; and in these proceedings it has always accepted that, when referring in the notices to &#8220;CIO London management&#8221;, it was referring to Mr Macris but in a way which (so it hoped) would avoid identifying him. In the notices the Authority concluded in relation to the telephone call &#8220;that (by virtue of the conduct of CIO London management) the Authority was deliberately misled by the Firm&#8221;. The allegation that during the telephone call Mr Macris deliberately misled the Authority is, if untrue, gravely damaging to him. But, in its later notices given to Mr Macris himself following its direct inquiry into his conduct, there is no such allegation. There is extensive reference to the same telephone call; and his conduct in the course of it is said to contribute to the conclusion that, as an approved person, he had failed to deal with the Authority in an open and cooperative way in breach of Statement of Principle 4 of the Authority&#8217;s Statements of Principle for Approved Persons. But the more gravely damaging allegation against Mr Macris is not repeated. Yet, by contrast, there, in the published decision notice given to the bank, the allegation remains. Apparently Mr Macris, whose employment by the bank has long since been terminated, cannot challenge it in any way. He cannot sue the Authority for damages, whether in tort or otherwise, because it has not acted in bad faith: paragraph 25 of Schedule 1ZA to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/60" uk:canonical="1986 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>. And, by the decision of the court today, he is not entitled to third party status under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/60/section/393" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 393</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/60" uk:canonical="1986 c. 60" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the Act</ref>.</p>

But there was also the report of the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations dated 15 March 2013 and entitled &#8220;JP Morgan Chase Whale Trades: A Case History of Derivatives Risks and Abuses&#8221;. As Judge Herrington said, the report was the subject of an in-depth investigation; was readily accessible on the subcommittee&#8217;s website; and contained many (in fact more than 80) references to Mr Macris. It had generated significant press attention. By cross-reference to the report, the ordinary market operator would readily conclude that the references in the notices to &#8220;CIO London management&#8221; were references to Mr Macris. When, for example, the notices referred to the despatch by &#8220;CIO London management&#8221; of an e-mail on 30 March 2012, the subcommittee report referred to its despatch by &#8220;Achilles Macris&#8221;. I do not share the concern of Lord Mance, expressed at para 39, that the report might not have been readily available to market operators in the UK; and I agree with the qualified acknowledgement by Lord Neuberger, at para 30, that it would provide an affirmative answer to my formulation of the question.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in"><span style="font-size:13pt">Nor do I join my colleagues in concluding that Mr Macris fails even to pass the first stage of the inquiry, which requires him to establish that, by reference only to the terms of the notices, the Authority&#8217;s criticisms of &#8220;CIO London management&#8221; refer to an individual. The Authority secured permission from the Court of Appeal to challenge the tribunal&#8217;s conclusion that Mr Macris had passed the first stage; but its challenge failed. In its Grounds of Appeal to this court there was no suggestion of any aspiration to mount a further challenge in this respect. Indeed in my view, had permission to do so been sought, it would have been refused; it does not raise a point of general public importance. I consider that, although good arguments relevant to the inquiry at the first stage have run both ways, it is no longer open to the Authority to dispute the passage of Mr Macris through it.</span></p>
