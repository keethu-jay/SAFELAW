	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The child, whom I shall call Haroon, was born on 20 October 2010 in Pakistan. His father (born in 1973) is one of five siblings, who were all born in England to parents who came here to live from Pakistan in the 1960s. His mother (born in 1978) is the father&#8217;s first cousin. She was born and brought up in Pakistan and entered into an arranged marriage with the father in Pakistan in 1999. She joined the father here the following year and they lived together in a property shared with other members of the father&#8217;s family. The mother and father have three children together who were born here: a daughter born in 2001, who is now 12, a second daughter born in 2002, who is now 10, and a son born in 2005, who is now eight. The father and children have dual British and Pakistani nationality and the mother has indefinite leave to remain here. This much is uncontentious.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The subsequent history was in dispute at the fact-finding hearing before Parker J in the High Court. However, the father had remained in Pakistan throughout, had never made a witness statement, and was neither present nor (by the final day) represented at the hearing. His version of events was put forward by his brother. The judge ordered him to take part by telephone but he could not be reached at the number through which he had previously been reached. The judge had no doubt that the telephone had been deliberately turned off. Nevertheless, she insisted that the mother give evidence and put the father&#8217;s version of events to her &#8220;quite forcefully&#8221;. She found the mother to be an &#8220;intelligent, careful and precise witness&#8221; and accepted her evidence. The following are therefore the facts as found by the judge.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The marriage was happy until 2006, when the father began to spend a good deal of time in Pakistan. In 2008, the mother complained of physical abuse by the father and moved with the three children into a refuge. Early in 2009, they moved into a flat owned by the father&#8217;s brother, PA, for which the mother paid rent. The mother planned to take the children on a trip to Pakistan in the autumn to visit her father. She obtained Pakistani identity cards for them, was given leave of absence from their school, and travelled out with them on 13 October 2009, with tickets to return early in November. She did not know that the father was going to be in Pakistan at the same time.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">While they were staying at her father&#8217;s home, the father, his mother and another brother arrived and, together with her own father, insisted that the parents reconcile. The mother felt that she had no choice: there was physical and emotional coercion. She returned with the father to his family home in Pakistan and was forced to give up her own and the children&#8217;s passports, although she later managed to retrieve her own. But she made it clear that she wanted to return with the children to England. The judge did not find it necessary to make &#8220;any specific finding about violence&#8221;. She was &#8220;quite satisfied that such pressure was put on the mother that she had no choice in her own mind, particularly because she did not want to leave her children and that she was frightened of the consequences&#8221;.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In February 2010, the mother became pregnant with Haroon. The refuge in England confirmed that, from that month, she was making telephone calls to them asking for their help to return with the children to England. After Haroon was born, the father brought proceedings for custody of the children in Pakistan. In December 2010, the mother&#8217;s father brought proceedings, as the judge termed it, &#8220;essentially for habeas corpus&#8221; of the mother and the four children. It appears that both sets of proceedings were dropped. Eventually, in May 2011, the mother&#8217;s father sent elders round to the father&#8217;s family to persuade them to let the mother leave for a few days to stay with relatives. She was thus able to leave the country with their help and return to England, but she had to leave the children behind. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">These proceedings began on 20 June 2011 with an order made by Peter Jackson J without notice to the father. By that order, the judge made all four children wards of court and ordered that they be returned to England and Wales by the father forthwith. Every person within the jurisdiction who was in a position to do so was ordered to co-operate in assisting and securing the children&#8217;s immediate return. Any person not within the jurisdiction who was in a position to do so was requested to co-operate in assisting and securing their immediate return. The judicial, administrative and law enforcement authorities of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan were requested to use their best endeavours to assist in taking any steps which might appear to them necessary and appropriate in locating, safeguarding and facilitating the return of the children in accordance with the spirit of the UK-Pakistan Judicial Protocol on Children Matters signed by the Chief Justice of Pakistan and the President of the Family Division of the High Court of England and Wales on 17 January 2003. That order was served on the father in Pakistan and confirmed by Her Honour Judge Coates on 30 September 2011.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 31 October 2011, the mother obtained a without notice order from Eleanor King J freezing the father&#8217;s assets in this country, with a view to sequestration as a means of persuading the father to comply with the court&#8217;s orders or at least of providing the mother with funds to litigate in Pakistan. This brought the father&#8217;s brother, PA, into the proceedings, as he is co-owner of one of the properties specifically named in the order. The order was confirmed by Her Honour Judge Cahill QC on 28 November 2011 after a hearing at which the father was represented by counsel, but not present. The matter was listed for determination of the jurisdiction question in February 2012. Despite various manoeuvrings in an attempt to have it postponed, the hearing went ahead before Parker J, with the father playing no part and PA now acting in person with another brother, JA, as his McKenzie friend. PA had also filed two witness statements setting out the case for the father and his family. </p>

She was satisfied that the mother never voluntarily sought for the children to live in Pakistan. She rejected the father&#8217;s assertion that there was an agreement that the parents should reconcile and live in Pakistan. She accepted that the mother never acquiesced, became resigned or consented to her and the children remaining in Pakistan. The three older children therefore retained their habitual residence in England.

The reserved judgment was sent to the parties in October 2012, but the order was not made until 31 January 2013, when a short supplemental judgment was delivered: <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/1396" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 1396" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 1396</ref> and <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/232" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 232" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 232</ref>. The Court unanimously dismissed the father&#8217;s appeal in respect of the three older children, described by Patten LJ as &#8220;quite hopeless&#8221;. But by a majority, Rimer and Patten LJJ, his appeal in relation to Haroon was allowed, on the ground that the acquisition of habitual residence in any country requires the child in question to be physically present there. Habitual residence is a question of fact and a rule that a newly born child is presumed on birth to take the habitual residence of his parents &#8220;would be a legal construct divorced from actual fact&#8221;. It would also be inconsistent with the approach of the Court of Justice of the European Union. <span style="font-style:italic">B v H (Habitual Residence: Wardship)</span> should be overruled. Thorpe LJ dissented. In his view a baby born to a mother resident here while on holiday abroad would be habitually resident here from the moment of birth and not from the time when he entered this country. But he recognised that &#8220;on its facts this case narrowly falls on the right side of an important boundary&#8221;.</p>

By the time of the hearing in January this year, it was clear that leading counsel now instructed on behalf of the mother would be seeking permission to appeal to this Court and wished to raise nationality as an alternative basis of jurisdiction. The most economical course, therefore, was for him to seek to argue the point in this Court and for the Court of Appeal to defer any consideration of the father&#8217;s forum non conveniens<span style="font-style:italic"/>argument until the outcome in this Court was known.</p>

More significantly, Article 10 provides for cases where a child has been wrongfully removed or retained. The courts of the Member State where the child was habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention retain jurisdiction until the child has acquired a habitual residence in another Member State and either each person with rights of custody has acquiesced in the removal or retention or (to paraphrase) the child lived there for at least a year after the person left behind should have known his whereabouts, the child is settled there and (in effect) there are no extant proceedings for his return. Article 12 gives jurisdiction in relation to parental responsibility if the child has a substantial connection with that Member State, all parties have accepted that jurisdiction, and it is in the best interests of the child: the application of this provision in a case where the child was habitually resident in Pakistan was considered by this Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Re I (A Child) (Contact Application: Jurisdiction)(Centre for Family Law and Practice intervening) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2009/10" uk:canonical="[2009] UKSC 10" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2009">[2009] UKSC 10</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] 1 AC 319" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] 1 AC 319</ref>.</p>

Article 15 provides, by way of exception, that the courts of the Member State having jurisdiction may transfer the case to another Member State with which the child has a particular connection, if it would be better placed to hear the case, and this is in the best interests of the child. Article 19.2 and 19.3 provide that, where proceedings relating to parental responsibility in respect of the same child are brought in different Member States, the court second seised must stay the proceedings until it is established whether the court first seised has jurisdiction, and if that court does have jurisdiction the second court must decline it. Article 20 allows the courts of a Member State to take provisional measures in urgent cases, even if another has jurisdiction over the substance of the matter.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Regulation deals with jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement in matrimonial and parental responsibility matters. Chapter III, dealing with recognition and enforcement, expressly deals with the recognition in one Member State of judgments given in another Member State: see article 21.1. But there is nothing in the various attributions of jurisdiction in Chapter II to limit these to cases in which the rival jurisdiction is another Member State. Article 3 merely asserts that in matters relating to divorce, legal separation or marriage annulment &#8220;jurisdiction shall lie with the courts of the Member State&#8221; in relation to which the various bases of jurisdiction listed there apply. Article 8 similarly asserts that the courts of a Member State &#8220;shall have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility . . .&#8221; Furthermore, article 12.4 deals with a case where the parties have accepted the jurisdiction of a Member State but the child is habitually resident in a non-Member State, thus clearly asserting jurisdiction as against the third country in question. Hence in <span style="font-style:italic">Re I (A Child) (Contact Application: Jurisdiction)</span>, this Court held that article 12 did apply in a case where the child was habitually resident in Pakistan. There is no reason to distinguish article 12 from the other bases of jurisdiction in the Regulation.</p>

The wording of articles 3 and 8 of the Regulation is not the same as that in article 2 of the Brussels Convention. Furthermore, article 19 of the Regulation deals with the position where there are pending proceedings in two Member States and article 15 allows the courts of the Member State having jurisdiction to transfer the case to another Member State in appropriate circumstances (see para 24 above).

Very recently, in <span style="font-style:italic">DL v EL </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2013/865" uk:canonical="[2013] EWCA Civ 865" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWCA Civ 865</ref>, at para 48, the Court of Appeal has expressed the view that &#8220;there is now no distinction to be drawn&#8221; between the test adopted in each of those three contexts.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Nevertheless, it is highly desirable that the same test be adopted and that, if there is any difference, it is that adopted by the Court of Justice. There are several reasons for this. First, the Law Commissions recommended the adoption of &#8220;habitual residence&#8221; in part because it had been widely used in international conventions, including the Council of Europe Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children and on Restoration of Custody of Children (1981) Cmnd 8155 and the Hague Child Abduction Convention, and was likely to be recognised abroad: see Law Com No 138, para 4.15. As Advocate General Kokott pointed out in <span style="font-style:italic">Proceedings brought by A </span>(<ref href="#" uk:canonical="Case C-523/07" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case">Case C-523/07</ref>) <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2010] Fam 42" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2010">[2010] Fam 42</ref>, various international conventions, in particular the Hague Convention of the Protection of Minors 1961, the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children 1996 which superseded it, and the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction 1980, formed part of the legislative history of the Regulation. In part, the Regulation supersedes them. In part, they operate alongside one another. The &#8220;fields of application of the various instruments must be consistently demarcated from one another&#8221;. This presumed a &#8220;uniform understanding of the concept of habitual residence&#8221; (para AG23). Thus it would appear that the purpose of both <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1986/55" uk:canonical="1986 c. 55" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1986 Act</ref> and the Regulation was to adopt a concept which would apply across the board.</p>

In the first place, the Law Commissions deliberately adopted &#8220;habitual&#8221; rather than &#8220;ordinary&#8221; residence, because the latter frequently occurred in tax and immigration statutes and they thought that its use in the wholly different context of family law was a potential source of confusion (Law Com No 138, para 4.15). Furthermore, the reference to adopting an abode &#8220;voluntarily and for settled purposes&#8221; is not readily applicable to a child, who usually has little choice about where he lives and no settled purpose, other than survival, in living there. If this test is adopted, the focus inevitably shifts from the actual situation of the child to the intentions of his parents.</p>

The most important of these is the &#8220;rule&#8221; that where two parents have parental responsibility for a child, one cannot change the child&#8217;s habitual residence unilaterally: this dates back at least as far as a dictum of Lord Donaldson MR in the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (A Minor) (Abduction: Custody Rights) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 2 AC 562" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 2 AC 562</ref>, at 572, and the decision of Wall J in <span style="font-style:italic">In re S (Minors)(Child Abduction: Wrongful Retention) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] Fam 70" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] Fam 70</ref>, approved by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re M (Abduction: Habitual Residence) </span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1996] 1 FLR 887" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1996">[1996] 1 FLR 887</ref>, 892, and taken for granted ever since.

As Lord Hughes points out, article 10 provides a good reason why the courts of England and Wales retain jurisdiction over the three older children in any event. The Hague Child Abduction Convention is concerned with wrongful removal or retention of a child from the country where he was habitually resident <span style="font-style:italic">immediately before</span> that wrongful removal or retention: see article 3. As Lord Hughes also points out, the &#8220;rule&#8221; is more relevant in retention than removal cases, but the answer may lie in treating the unilateral change of habitual residence as the act of wrongful retention, even if it takes place before the child was due to be returned. The matter may therefore require fuller consideration in another case, but it is not necessary for us to express a concluded view.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It may then seem a small step to apply this principle to a case in which the child has never even been present, let alone lived, in the country where his primary carer is habitually resident. It is not difficult to think of examples where this would accord with both the underlying reality and the &#8220;criterion of proximity&#8221; referred to in Recital 12 to the Regulation. In this case, Thorpe LJ gave the example of &#8220;an English mother habitually resident in England who gives birth to a child in France. As a result of complications mother and child are hospitalised for an extended period before they are fit to come home&#8221; (para 29). In his view, the child was habitually resident in England from birth and not just from when she set foot in this country. In <span style="font-style:italic">In re T (A Child)(Care Proceedings: Request to Assume Jurisdiction</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/521" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 521 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 521 (Fam)</ref>, <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] Fam 253" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] Fam 253</ref>, a pregnant 17 year old Slovakian girl ran away from a children&#8217;s home in Slovakia and gave birth to the baby here.

Charles J held that all the children, including the new baby, were habitually resident here. He placed some reliance on <span style="font-style:italic">Re J </span>(above) and also took the view that to erect a positive rule that physical presence was a necessary prerequisite to establishing an habitual residence ran &#8220;counter to the proposition . . . that habitual residence is, or is primarily, an issue of fact and is not an artificial concept&#8221; (para 133).

Thus one can be habitually resident somewhere where one is not actually present at the relevant time. No-one doubts that this mother remained habitually resident in England during her enforced absence in Pakistan. From this too, it can appear artificial to construct a rule that physical presence at some time, however fleeting, is an essential pre-requisite.</p>

A person may cease to be habitually resident in country A in a single day if he or she leaves it with a settled intention not to return to it but to take up long-term residence in country B instead. Such a person cannot, however, become habitually resident in country B in a single day. An appreciable period of time and a settled intention will be necessary to enable him or her to become so. During that appreciable period of time the person will have ceased to be habitually resident in country A but not yet have become habitually resident in country B.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">I share Lord Hughes&#8217; view that the third and fourth points made by Lord Brandon are best seen as helpful generalisations of fact, which will usually but not invariably be true, rather than as propositions of law. There has been a tendency to construe this fourth statement as if it were a statute, and debate the meaning of &#8220;appreciable time&#8221;. I would not accept that it is impossible to become habitually resident in a single day. It will all depend upon the circumstances. But I would accept that one may cease to be habitually resident in one country without having yet become habitually resident in another.</p>

Without that, the child would undoubtedly have become habitually resident in this country. Third, the European Court would have to consider the implications for the Hague Child Abduction Convention if a child such as this, or a child born on holiday, were held to have no country of habitual residence. The whole Convention, beginning with article 3, is predicated upon there being a state where the child is habitually resident immediately before the wrongful removal or retention.

They submitted that, while there should be no rule that a new-born child takes the habitual residence of the mother, the child&#8217;s place of birth should carry little weight where the only reason that the child has been born in a particular place is because the mother has been deprived of her autonomy to choose where to give birth. The Centre for Family Law and Practice, whose co-Director has conducted some important research into child abduction, similarly submitted that a person who had used such coercion should not be enabled to deprive the child of the protection of the courts of the country where he would otherwise have been born. More broadly, it has been suggested that, given the inherent vagueness of the concept, the decision in any particular case will inevitably depend upon a balance between the applicable policy considerations: see Rhona Schuz, &#8220;Policy Considerations in Determining the Habitual Residence of a Child and the Relevance of Context&#8221; (2001) 11 <span style="font-style:italic">J Transnational Law and Policy </span>101.</p>

The common law rules as to the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court continue to apply. There is no doubt that this jurisdiction can be exercised if the child is a British national. The original basis of the jurisdiction was that the child owed allegiance to the Crown and in return the Crown had a protective or parens patriae<span style="font-style:italic"/>jurisdiction over the child wherever he was.

The first question then is, whether this principle applies to children born out of the allegiance of the Crown ; and I confess that I do not entertain any doubt upon the point, because the moment that it is established by statute that the children of a natural born father born out of the Queen's allegiance are to all intents and purposes to be treated as British born subjects, of course it is clear that one of the incidents of a British born subject is, that he or she is entitled to the protection of the Crown, as <span style="font-style:italic">parens patria</span>.&#8221;</p>

At times, the guidance offered comes close to being framed as propositions of law, although usually this has not been the intention of the authors. Such intention was disclaimed in <span style="font-style:italic">Mozes v Mozes</span> and it is absent also, I think, from the locus classicus in England and Wales of Lord Brandon of Oakbrook&#8217;s speech in <span style="font-style:italic">Re</span><span/><span style="font-style:italic">J (A Minor) (Abduction: Custody Rights)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1990] 2 AC 562" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1990">[1990] 2 AC 562</ref>.

		    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">&#8220;The third point is that there is a significant difference between a person ceasing to be habitually resident in country A, and his subsequently becoming habitually resident in country B. A person may cease to be habitually resident in country A in a single day if he or she leaves it with a settled intention not to return to it but to take up long-term residence in country B instead. Such a person cannot, however, become habitually resident in country B in a single day. An appreciable period of time and a settled intention will be necessary to enable him or her to become so. During that appreciable period of time the person will have ceased to be habitually resident in country A but not yet have become habitually resident in country B. The fourth point is that, where a child of J's age is in the sole lawful custody of the mother, his situation with regard to habitual residence will necessarily be the same as hers.&#8221;</p>

One is that an habitual residence in country A may be abandoned in a single day. A second is that habitual residence in country B cannot be established (or, as English lawyers are prone to say, &#8220;acquired&#8221;) in a single day, and a third is that an infant who is in the sole lawful custody of his mother will necessarily have the same habitual residence as she has (or, as English lawyers are prone to say, will &#8220;derive&#8221; his habitual residence from hers).</p>

An &#233;migr&#233; flying from Heathrow to a new home in Australia, who has sold every possession in England and intends to make a permanent home in Sydney will surely normally no longer be habitually resident in England from the day of his departure. But it might perhaps be different if he had neglected to obtain permission from Australia to re-locate, and decided at Dubai that he would return to England. A person arriving in a foreign country hoping to make his permanent home there will no doubt in many cases not be regarded as habitually resident there until he has established himself, with home, occupation, permission to reside and so on. But if he has pre-arranged all of this and is joining his spouse and family, it might well be that his habitual residence would be established more or less immediately on arrival.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The same is true of Lord Brandon&#8217;s third generalisation, which is of direct relevance to the present case. One commonly relevant factor in the establishment of habitual residence is clearly the intention of the individual. But an infant of very tender years is in no position to form any independent intention. His or her habitual residence will normally be established by belonging to a family unit which has habitual residence in a particular place, and the infant will thus share it. As a generalisation it is therefore plainly true that the infant will normally share the habitual residence of the person who has lawful custody of him, and this is a valuable aid to courts. But this is not an invariable rule of law, and it is not too difficult to envisage factual situations in which this proposition will not be true. If a young unmarried woman who is habitually resident in State A but whose parents live in State B becomes pregnant and determines to give birth to her child back at the home of her parents, and thereafter by agreement with them to leave the child there to be brought up by them, she will no doubt remain habitually resident in State A. If State A is England she will, by English law, have the &#8216;sole lawful custody&#8217; of the child (ie sole parental rights and the right, unless and until a court intervenes, to determine where the child lives). But neither before or after she travels back to England after the birth, leaving the child in State B as planned, will the child will &#8220;derive&#8221; his habitual residence from hers as a matter of law, nor will he share it with her as a matter of fact.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The trans-national movement of children in the course of disputes about their upbringing, and the associated forum-shopping by parents and others, is a major international problem. Its incidence has only grown since the 1980 Hague Convention, with the increase in cross-border personal relationships and the ever-greater ease of international travel. The 1980 Convention may on occasion operate as a relatively blunt instrument, and no one would claim that its necessarily summary procedure is incapable of ever resulting in injustice, but its contribution to controlling this international problem has been immense. As between the large number of party States, it proceeds upon the basis that in the event of wrongful removal or retention of a child there should normally be a summary return to the State of his or her habitual residence and that the necessary, and often finely balanced, merits decisions which fall to be made are to be made in the courts of that country. In turn, wrongful removal or retention is to be ascertained by reference to the rights of the parties under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the event. This has spawned, in England at least, a proposition closer than those above to a rule of law, namely that where two parents have parental responsibility for a child, one of them cannot by unilateral action alter the habitual residence of the child: see Lord Donaldson of Lymington MR in the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re J (A Minor) (Abduction: Custody Rights)</span> supra at 572 and Wall J in <span style="font-style:italic">In re S (Minors) (Abduction: Wrongful Retention)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1994] Fam 70" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1994">[1994] Fam 70</ref>. The occasion for propounding this &#8216;rule&#8217; was not so much the case of wrongful removal but that of wrongful retention. In most cases of wrongful removal, the habitual residence of the child immediately before removal will not be put in doubt by the unilateral actions of one parent. But in the case of wrongful retention, it may. If for example the child, hitherto living with parent A in State A, is visiting parent B in State B under an agreement for contact, and whilst there parent B unilaterally makes arrangements for the child to stay permanently, such as by obtaining immigration rights, enrolling at school and taking similar associated steps, it may be contended that such steps cause the child thereafter to be habitually resident in State B. If, additionally, the view is taken that retention does not occur until the time arrives at which the child is due to return to State A, the argument can be advanced that by then the child is habitually resident in State B, where it follows that retention cannot be wrongful. To hold that parent B&#8217;s unilateral actions cannot bring about a change of habitual residence is one route to ensuring that the 1980 Convention is not made ineffective in such a case.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It seems to me important to note this situation, which is not rare. As Lady Hale explains at paras 39-40, Brussels II revised contains provisions designed for such a case. Article 10 preserves the jurisdiction of State A not only until habitual residence has been established in State B but also until either all relevant persons have acquiesced in the removal/retention or (broadly) a year has passed, the child is settled and there has been unjustified failure to object, or the courts of State A have reached a determination inconsistent with the continued exercise of jurisdiction. But neither under Article 10 nor the 1980 Hague Convention can this continuing jurisdiction in State A operate if by the time of retention (or even removal) habitual residence has already changed. What matters most is that State A can make an effective order for return. This may be either under the 1980 Hague Convention (as chiefly it will be) or outside it, as may well be possible if the person ordered to make the return is present in State A or has property there (as here). So what matters is where the child&#8217;s habitual residence was immediately before the removal or retention.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I agree with Lady Hale that we are not called upon to resolve this question in the present case, which must await another day. I also agree that it is apparent from Article 10 that Brussels II revised contemplates that habitual residence may shift at some stage <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> a wrongful removal or retention. It may well be that the problem identified can be resolved consistently with the effectiveness of the 1980 Hague Convention. It may well be that the correct view is that unilateral acts designed to make permanent the child&#8217;s stay in State B are properly to be regarded as acts of wrongful retention, notwithstanding that the scheduled end of the child&#8217;s visit has not yet arrived. Such a conclusion is not, to my mind, in any way precluded by the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">Re H (Minors) (Abduction: Custody Rights)</span> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1991] 2 AC 476" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1991">[1991] 2 AC 476</ref>, which holds no more than that a specific act of retention must be identified, and it is consistent with the decision of Wall J in <span style="font-style:italic">In re S</span> (supra). The significance of the point here is simply twofold. First, Brussels II Revised is, notwithstanding that in the event of conflict it prevails over the 1980 Hague Convention (see Article 60), clearly meant to co-exist consistently with that Convention remaining effective &#8211; see for example Articles 10 and 11 &#8211; and it ought to be construed wherever possible with that very important objective in mind; in particular the concept of habitual residence needs to be construed similarly in each of the two instruments. Second, providing this approach is adopted, it is unlikely that even in this situation it is necessary to formulate a rule of law that a child&#8217;s habitual residence cannot unilaterally be changed by one parent where two parents both have parental responsibility.</p>

In the former, parents of Indian origin who were living in England agreed on their separation to send their son to India for his minority, to be brought up by his grandparents. Mother subsequently changed her mind and sought to make the child, still in India, a ward of the English court. The issue was whether her decision changed the habitual residence of the boy back to England. The argument was that it did because the continuing assent of both parents was necessary as a matter of law to his continuing habitual residence being in India. That argument was rejected, as it is clear it would be today both in Europe and in England. It is perfectly correct that Sir John Balcombe said this at 895:</p>

Of course, residence does not necessarily require physical presence at all times. Temporary absence on holiday, or for educational purposes (as in <span style="font-style:italic">Re A), </span>will not bring to an end habitual residence. But here the judge found as a fact, and on ample evidence, that K became habitually resident in India. He has never to this day come back to England. As a matter of fact, he has not been resident in England since he went to India in February 1994. Bracewell J held that the mother's change of mind both brought to an end K's habitual residence in India and gave him an habitual residence in England.</p>

Clearly, the mother's change of mind could not alter the fact that he was, and is, physically resident in India. Whether her change of mind could alone alter the 'habitual' nature of that residence I very much doubt, but in any event it is not necessary finally to decide that point on this appeal, since the one thing about which I am quite clear is that the child's residence in India could not become a residence in England and Wales without his ever having returned to this country. As I said before, the idea that a child's residence can be changed without his ever leaving the country where he is resident is to abandon the factual basis of 'habitual residence' and to clothe it with some metaphysical or abstract basis more appropriate to a legal concept such as domicil.&#8221;</p>

	    <p class="ParaNoNumber">It was sufficient for the decision that that independent habitual residence was not altered simply by the wish of one parent. It is unsurprising that the fact that the boy had remained in India was treated as an additional reason why his habitual residence was still there. He had clearly established an habitual residence independent of his parents. The court did not have before it the case of an infant who has no independence of his parents but is by contrast integrated into the family unit of one of them.</p>

Some months later the mother and stepfather became disenchanted with Dubai, quarelled with father and returned to England without the boy. On the question of habitual residence, the issue was whether the boy&#8217;s had reverted to England because Mother&#8217;s had. That was an argument for dependent (or legally &#8220;derived&#8221;) habitual residence, which the court rightly rejected. In doing so, Thorpe LJ cited the passages above quoted from <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span>. They were clearly cited for the rejection of dependent habitual residence. Once again, the fact that the boy remained in Dubai was an additional reason why his habitual residence remained there. Once again, the court did not have to consider the case of an infant who was an integrated member of a family unit which was habitually resident in a particular place and did not change it. In the present case Thorpe LJ clearly did not regard either this decision or <span style="font-style:italic">Re M</span> as binding the Court of Appeal to hold that the youngest child could not be habitually resident in England because he had not yet physically reached these shores, for he dissented from the decision that it did. Particularly given his unrivalled experience of all aspects of cross border family issues, his views deserve considerable weight. This court is not in any event bound even if the Court of Appeal was, but for my part I agree with him.</p>

In neither case did the court have to consider the case of an infant who is an integrated member of a family unit which was habitually resident in State A although currently detained against the will of the adult in State B. Whilst in both cases the court incorporated into its decision, at paras 38 and 49 respectively, the need for other evidence &#8220;in addition to mere presence&#8221; it is crystal clear that this was said in order to demonstrate that mere presence was not automatically <span style="font-style:italic">sufficient</span>.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The CJEU emphasised in both cases the importance of examining the degree of integration of the child into a social and family environment. It emphasised in <span style="font-style:italic">Mercredi v Chaffe</span> at paras 54 &#8211; 55, cited above at para 80(viii), the manner in which an infant&#8217;s environment is essentially a family one. In the present case, the youngest child was born into a family unit which consisted of his mother and siblings; Father had been, when in England, estranged from it and living elsewhere. This family unit had its habitual residence in England. So, in my view, did the youngest child. He similarly would have shared their habitual residence if he had been born unexpectedly whilst mother was on holiday in Spain, or at sea on a cruise or in transit. In any of these situations, if one asked anyone but a lawyer where the newly born child was habitually resident, the answer would, in my view, have been &#8220;With his mother, brother and sisters of course&#8221;. The same would be true, as it seems to me, if he was born to his mother at a time when she was running away from home and temporarily abroad, like the mother in flight from Slovakia in<span style="font-style:italic"> In re T (a Child)(Care Proceedings; Request to Assume Jurisdiction) </span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewhc/fam/2013/521" uk:canonical="[2013] EWHC 521 (Fam)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] EWHC 521 (Fam)</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2013] Fam 253" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] Fam 253</ref>.</p>

There the British father, of Afghan origin, travelled back to Afghanistan to marry. His wife, the mother, planned to come to England but had never left Afghanistan when their first child was born. Her subsequent journey (alone) to England may have resulted in her own habitual residence being established in England, but clearly could not affect that of the child, which was understandably conceded by experienced counsel to be in Afghanistan. There was in that case no family unit with an habitual residence in England, into which the child was born. Nor was there any question of Mother being detained in Afghanistan by coercion. There was rightly no suggestion in the Court of Appeal of any rule of law either that the child &#8220;derived&#8221; habitual residence from one or other parent, or that the fact that the child had never been present in England was alone enough to resolve the question. Jurisdiction based on the nationality of the child was not advanced in that case.</p>

I see no occasion for any such rule. There is, I entirely agree, also no &#8216;rule&#8217; automatically ascribing habitual residence by dependence to a place to which the child has never been. There is a factual enquiry into the integration of the family unit to which he or she belongs, and that may well yield the conclusion that the child shares the habitual residence of that unit even if he has not yet achieved physical presence there, especially if he is being prevented by coercion or other force majeure from doing so. The decision of the Court of Appeal in this case involves a rule or general proposition because it necessarily excludes habitual residence without some past physical presence. The contrary approach, which to my mind is correct, involves no rule or generality at all, save for the advice to look, in the case of an infant, at the position of the family unit of which he is part. This does not involve a rule for dependent habitual residence. It merely asserts the possibility that habitual residence may exist in a State which is the home of the family unit of which the infant is part, and is where he would be but for force majeure.</p>

But it is well established that although rules of law are generally inappropriate the concept of habitual residence is necessarily to some extent a legal one; as Patten LJ said at para 59, it is a jurisdictional concept. And it is well established that habitual residence can and often does co-exist with actual current absence. If current physical presence is not essential, then so also can habitual residence exist without any physical presence yet having occurred, at least if it has only been prevented by some kind of unexpected force majeure.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">There can be no doubt about the jurisdiction of the English court in relation to the elder siblings. This is not because of any rule of law which prevents one of two parents from unilaterally altering the habitual residence of a child. It is because as the 1980 Hague Convention requires, in the case of abduction, whether removal or, as here, retention, the acid test is habitual residence immediately before the event. They were resident in England. They went to Pakistan only for a three week holiday. There they have been wrongfully retained. For the same reason, Article 10 of Brussels II revised maintains the jurisdiction of the English court. The only difference between the elder children and the youngest is the accidental fact that he has not yet reached the shores of his homeland. The reason why he has not done so is because he has been wrongly detained elsewhere by coercion. In my view he is, like them, a member of a family unit which is firmly based in England and when born into it he was like the rest of its members habitually resident there. His wrongful retention commenced immediately afterwards. Indeed, if the Court of Appeal is right, he could now be removed to another country without the removal being wrongful; such successive transportation of children to avoid enforced return is by no means unknown. There would, in my respectful view, be a serious failure of the protection afforded by the 1980 Hague Convention and Article 10 if a newly born child in this situation is held to have no habitual residence and thus to be incapable of wrongful removal or retention. I am unable to see any sufficient reason for such a conclusion.</p>
