	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The claimant Mrs Jacqueline Cross was employed by the respondent NHS Somerset Clinical Commissioning Group from 6 January 2014 as a nurse, initially at band 5 and later at band 6.  She was appointed to a band 8 role in 2016. Her case is that she was reluctant to take the role, as it involved leadership responsibilities, and she felt to a degree pressurised into it.  She makes complaint about the manner in which she was treated. Whether that complaint was justified or not, it is common ground that she found the work extremely difficult.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She was subsequently absent from work for reasons related to stress in the summers of both 2019 and 2020.  Eventually, in early 2021, she tendered her resignation on notice, and her employment terminated on 23 April 2021.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">That resignation letter was made with the benefit of advice from solicitors, and referred to intended claims for constructive / unfair dismissal, and detriments on grounds of protected disclosures.  The claimant indicated to the respondent that she also intended to raise a formal grievance, and in due course she did.  A meeting was held about the grievance on 7 May 2021.  At this stage the claimant no longer had legal advice, but she did have benefit of assistance of representatives from her union, the Royal College of Nursing, although these were not legally qualified individuals, and her case was passed between three different representatives.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 8 July 2021, the claimant emailed the respondent indicating that she intended to initiate pre-claim conciliation with ACAS, "In order to preserve my rights to bring a tribunal claim in due course, should that be necessary".  The early conciliation certificate shows that ACAS was notified that day, and the certificate was issued on 19 August 2021.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the meantime, the claimant had spoken by telephone with an ACAS officer, Michael Henry.  She later said in an email to Mr Henry, dated 9 November 2021, "It has now been a few months since I had a call with you / ACAS.  I understood from my call that I could raise my matter with you any time after I had received a grievance outcome.  I have only just received the outcome, and would like advice on next steps please.  I am soon entering into a discussion with my ex-employer about the outcome, and need to be prepared to appeal if needed.  Please can we arrange a call".</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The grievance outcome had been sent by the respondent to the claimant on 5 November 2021.  The claimant then had a conversation with someone (not Mr Henry) at ACAS, who told her that the certificate had only been valid for one month from issue.  The claimant said in her statement, "I remember thinking that something was wrong at this point, and I was feeling heightened anxiety.  I explained that I had been waiting for the grievance outcome for many months.  I had understood from my call with ACAS that I could raise my employment tribunal claim any time after I had received a grievance outcome".</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The claimant issued an ET1 on 10 November 2021.  In its ET3 dated 23 February 2022, the respondent asserted that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction because the claims for unfair dismissal were time-barred.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 20 July 2022, Employment Judge LeGrys heard the time bar point by video hearing.  The claimant gave evidence and was cross-examined.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In that evidence, the claimant stated that the legal aspects of a tribunal claim were all new to her, but that she found out about notifying ACAS, who tried to conciliate before a claim could be brought.  She stated that she had a call with an ACAS staff member, and she "believed (she) was safe in the ACAS system".  Her evidence, in line with her written statement and her email of 9 November 2021 to which I referred above, was that following her conversation with Mr Henry she understood that she had done everything she needed to do, and that she ought to await the grievance outcome before issuing any claim.  It was clarified in the course of the submissions to me today that she was not asked about the precise terms of that conversation.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Judge gave a determination on 25 July 2022.  Written reasons were then requested and provided on 15 August 2022, and sent  to the parties on 26 August 2022.  The Judge referred to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/18/section/111/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 111(2)</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/18" uk:canonical="1996 c. 18" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Employment Rights Act 1996</ref> and noted that it was agreed between the parties that a claim ought to have been presented by 18 September 2021. The Judge recorded that it was common ground that the claimant had issued her claim within a reasonable time <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> her conversation with the second ACAS officer - so that the "sole issue" was therefore "whether it was reasonably practicable for the claim to have been presented in time".</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At paragraph 25 of the reasons, Judge LeGrys held that the claimant had, at the relevant time, a genuine belief that notifying ACAS of her claim was sufficient.  The Judge found that her evidence was credible and supported by her actions at the conclusion of the grievance process, including the contact with ACAS I have referred to as well as the fact that she submitted the ET1 promptly.  He rejected any suggestion that the stress and anxiety which the claimant was under had contributed anything to the delay in bringing her claim. These were findings the Judge was clearly entitled to make on the evidence and are not challenged before me.</p>

There was a lack of clarity in the judgment about what the finding was regarding the claimant's belief. It had not been not open to the Judge to make a finding that the claimant had access to legal advice regarding the impact of ACAS conciliation on time limits as there was no evidence that she was in contact with any legally qualified person at that time. </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She submitted that the Judge had failed to ask the right question when considering reasonableness: the behaviour of the claimant should have been compared with that of a reasonable person, in order to identify what she did that she ought not to have done, (or rather what she failed to do but ought to have done).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She further submitted that the question of the claimant's precise knowledge regarding time limits had not been explored in evidence, and there was some confusion in the judgment as to the time at which advice was available, and the court ought to recognise that lay persons who do not have legal expertise would consider it perfectly reasonable to take the ACAS advice, and to accept that they needed to wait, and without question.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She submitted that paragraph 28 of the judgment, which referred to there being no need to wait for the grievance process before issuing tribunal proceedings, and the lack of reinstatement claim, was inconsistent with the other findings in the judgment, where it had been held that the claimant genuinely believed that there was nothing further that she needed to do to start proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the circumstances, she submitted, it was wrong to say that the claimant was waiting for the substance of the outcome of the grievance.  She pointed out that there is no consideration by the Judge in terms of whether in fact it was reasonable to rely on what ACAS had told her or not, and no evidence was explored about what she had been told.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Winstone submitted on behalf of the respondent that the judgment, when read fairly and in the round, made a finding that was open to the tribunal, namely that the claimant's belief was not a reasonable one.  The approach that I need to take, she reminded me, is in accordance with long-established precedent as recently reiterated in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Edwards v Everard</span> <ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/eat/2023/61" uk:canonical="[2023] EAT 61" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2023">[2023] EAT 61</ref>.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In that case, the EAT was reminded that it is inappropriate to seek to construe the words of a judgment as if they were a statute.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Winstone also submitted that there was nothing glaringly contradictory in the judgment reasons, and the Judge clearly had in mind the fact that the claimant had at all times awareness of her right to claim, and also as to the time limits which applied.  The Judge had found that the claimant knew that there was a procedure that needed to be followed in respect of any tribunal claim, and had also been entitled to find that the claimant had access to sources of information and advice which would have provided the right answer to the time limits point, and corrected her mistaken belief, should she have sought to double-check it, namely her previous solicitors, or her union representatives, with whom she remained in contact, although they may not have been legally trained. She pointed out that there was also publicly available information such as on the internet and the RCN website, the Royal College of Nursing website, as well as the ACAS website.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She submitted that, properly understood, the judgment showed that the Judge had taken the view that the claimant ought to have been alive to a contradiction or at least a tension between her interpretation of what ACAS had told her, and what the claimant already knew from her previous solicitors and her union representatives, and that uncertainty ought to have rung some alarm bells, and at the very least given the reasonable person cause to question the ACAS information, and to double-check it.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Winstone accepted that the note of the claimant's evidence was correct insofar as it revealed that the claimant had never been asked about the terms of the conversation she had had with ACAS or what the claimant believed was going to happen next, and when she needed to start her claim.  Ms Winstone submitted that the claimant's memory was hazy, and that she was a poor witness in cross-examination, because she was claiming that she was adversely affected by her emotional and mental health difficulties.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Winstone further said that the claimant's belief ought to have been jolted by presentation of the certificate of conciliation in August 2021, and that the finding of the judge in the last sentence at paragraph 27 of his judgment was to the effect that, because the claimant was aware that the grievance and conciliation processes were separate, that was something that the judge was entitled to place weight on when considering the reasonableness of the claimant's belief.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Winstone also made submissions regarding paragraph 28 of the judgment, and explained that really what the judge was doing was setting out an alternative or hypothetical scenario (in which the claimant might have been in with a better chance of being considered reasonable) if the facts had been different, for example, if she had been waiting for the substantive outcome of the grievance before issuing her tribunal proceedings.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">She pointed out that the judge had been entitled to find at paragraph 29 that it would have been reasonable for the claimant to ascertain the correct facts regarding the time limit, and possible for the claimant to do this over the internet.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Ms Winstone again warned me against the risk that an appeal tribunal faces of overstepping its powers, and seeking to substitute my own decision for that of the tribunal, which would be wholly impermissible.  She therefore invited me to dismiss the appeal but, strictly in the alternative, Ms Winstone suggested that the case, if the appeal were to be allowed, it could be referred to the tribunal under the <span style="font-style:italic">Burns/Barke</span> procedure, or that remission to the same employment judge would be proportionate. She reminded me that tribunal judges are consummate professionals, who are well used to revisiting previous judgments, and can be expected to do so fairly, and with an open mind.</p>

Thus, where a person is reasonably ignorant of the existence of the right at all, he can hardly be found to have been acting unreasonably in not making inquiries as to how, and within what period, he should exercise it. By contrast, if he does know of the existence of the right, it may in many cases at least, though not necessarily all, be difficult for him to satisfy an industrial tribunal that he behaved reasonably in not making such inquiries.&#8221;</p>

I would like to suggest that some limit be placed on the reporting of these cases.  They all turn very much on their own facts.

Although the judgment follows a standard format, setting out various matters under a heading, "Facts", (between paragraphs 6 to 15), I have struggled to identify precisely what findings the Judge made, particularly in relation to the claimant's specific mistaken belief. The Judge does not make any clear findings as to the claimant&#8217;s understanding about her claim following the conversation with the ACAS conciliation officer on 9 July 2021 or how that understanding arose. Whilst (at paragraph 15) the Judge records the evidence the claimant gave, the Judge does not express whether he accepts that evidence or not.  </p>

It is true that at paragraph 25, the Judge goes onto hold that the claimant was a credible witness, and that her belief that notifying ACAS of her claim was &#8216;sufficient&#8217; was genuine. The Judge finds further at paragraph 26 that she was under considerable stress at the time, and genuinely did not realise she had to do anything further. However, the ambit of the Judge&#8217;s finding as to the nature of the claimant&#8217;s mistaken belief was not clear to me.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgement the lack of clarity led to irrelevant considerations being taken into account on the question of reasonableness of the mistaken belief.  The Judge relied on the fact that the grievance did not seek reinstatement when assessing whether the claimant&#8217;s mistaken belief was reasonable. For myself, I cannot see how the absence of a claim for reinstatement in her grievance could possibly have been relevant to the question of reasonableness of the claimant's actual belief about time limits as the Judge had found it to be.  Ms Winstone told me in submissions that this issue was one which appeared to concern the Judge at the hearing and was not a matter which had been advanced in submissions by either side.  It can be seen from the reasons that the Judge clearly attached weight to the fact that the claimant had not been seeking reinstatement in her grievance when considering whether her reliance on ACAS advice was reasonable.</p>

I accept the submission of Ms Mullins that the substance of the grievance was not what the claimant was awaiting &#8211; on the Judge&#8217;s own findings as to her mistaken belief, she was waiting for the outcome as a procedural step. The issue was whether the claimant's belief that her claim was &#8216;safe&#8217; and &#8216;in the system&#8217; and that she had taken the steps necessary to bring a tribunal claim in time, should she need to, was reasonable or not, and the substance of the grievance was a feature that he ought not to have taken into account.</p>

Ms Winstone did not cross-examine the claimant on the content of her conversation with ACAS, or why she came away with the belief that she had taken the steps needed to protect any future claim, and the Judge did not ask those questions either.  I therefore consider it fundamentally unfair for the Judge to rely on the absence of explanation in criticism of the claimant, as she had been effectively deprived of any opportunity to explain herself.</p>

It was as a result of her conversation with the ACAS officer on 9 July.

Indeed, as quoted at paragraph 11 of the facts section of the judgment, the claimant was expressly seeking to reserve her rights to claim only in the event that that "should&#8230;be necessary". In my judgement, the evidence only supported a finding that, (at least at the stage when she had legal advice), the claimant was open to negotiation with the respondent through the conciliation process.

Whilst I have every faith that he would approach any rehearing with an open mind, and full professionalism, the appearance would still nevertheless remain that there is a possibility that the claimant would not have a fair rehearing on the reissue. I confess that I make this order with some reluctance, given that the matter is now nearly three years old and, although of undoubted importance to the parties, of relatively modest value overall.  However, I feel I am left with no alternative, and in those circumstances the matter will need to be remitted.  </p>
