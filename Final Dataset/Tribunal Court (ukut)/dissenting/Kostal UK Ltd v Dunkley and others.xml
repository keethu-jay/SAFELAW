The stated purpose of this agreement was to establish trade union recognition and representation within the Company and establish a framework for consultation and collective bargaining (clause 1.2). The agreement gave Unite &#8220;sole recognition and bargaining rights&#8221; (clause 2.1). By clause 3.1, the Company and Unite accepted that &#8220;the terms of this agreement are binding in honour upon them but do not constitute a legally binding agreement&#8221;.</p>

Appendix 1 outlined a procedure that &#8220;will be followed in order to deal with collective issues which if not resolved, could lead to a dispute between the parties&#8221; and stated that &#8220;[d]uring the procedural process, there will be no ... change imposed by either party&#8221;.

As part of the same package, the Company sought a reduction in sick pay for new starters, a reduction in the Sunday overtime rate and consolidation of two separate 15 minute breaks into a single 30 minute break (which would comply with the Working Time Regulations 1998).</p>

The total award was &#163;421,800. The tribunal found as a fact that, after its offer in the negotiations with Unite had been rejected in the ballot of union members, the Company had taken the conscious decision to by-pass further meaningful negotiations and contact with the union in favour of making direct offers to individual employees.</p>

Those employees such as Wilson and Palmer who refused to sign such contracts did not receive the same benefits. In tribunal proceedings the claimants complained that their employers&#8217; conduct infringed their rights under what is now <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/146/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 146(1)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52" uk:canonical="1992 c. 52" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1992 Act</ref> not to have action (short of dismissal) taken against them as individuals for the purpose of preventing or deterring them from being members of a trade union. Their claims ultimately failed when the House of Lords held (by a majority): (i) that the withholding from the claimants of benefits conferred on other employees who agreed to sign personal contracts constituted an omission rather than an &#8220;action&#8221;; and (ii) that anyway the employers&#8217; purpose was not to prevent or deter the claimants from being members of a trade union as such, but only to prevent or deter them from using the union for the particular purpose of collective bargaining.

The Court upheld the complaints. It did not accept that the absence under UK law of an obligation on employers to enter into collective bargaining gave rise, in itself, to a violation of article 11: see para 45 of the judgment.

Another was to regulate the &#8220;freedom to agree individualised contracts&#8221;. The Review noted that &#8220;[e]mployers often enter contractual arrangements with individual workers which contain different terms from the provisions of a collective agreement&#8221; and recorded the Government&#8217;s view that it is &#8220;essential that employers and individuals should retain their freedom to agree individualised contracts&#8221; (paras 3.12 - 3.13).

The result is that it would be unlawful for an employer to offer an inducement to the union members in such a group to have their terms of employment determined outside the framework set by any existing collective bargaining arrangements. This limits the scope of employers to offer individualised contracts. To avoid inflexibility however, the law should allow employers to make offers where the sole or main purpose of the inducement is unconnected with the aim of undermining or narrowing the collective bargaining arrangements. In particular, the law should give room for employers and individuals to enter individualised contracts designed to reward or retain key workers.&#8221; (Emphasis in original)</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">First, as with any question of statutory interpretation, the task of the court is to determine the meaning and legal effect of the words used by Parliament. The modern case law - including, in the field of employment law, the recent decision of this court in <span style="font-style:italic">Uber BV v Aslam</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2021/5" uk:canonical="[2021] UKSC 5" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] UKSC 5</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2021] ICR 657" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] ICR 657</ref>, para 70 - has emphasised the central importance of identifying the purpose of the legislation and interpreting the relevant language in the light of that purpose. Sometimes the context and background, or the statute viewed as a whole, provides clear pointers to the objectives which the relevant provisions were seeking to achieve. In other cases, however, the purpose needs to be identified at a level of particularity which requires it to be elicited mainly from the wording of the relevant provisions themselves. The present case is one in which, although the legal context and aim of seeking to secure article 11 rights is important, the somewhat complicated and elaborate wording of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B (and <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>D) calls, in my view, for a careful linguistic analysis on the assumption that the words used have been chosen with precision.</p>

It is that result which (as its appellation indicates) represents the mischief which the legislation aims to prevent or deter. The employer has a defence if it shows that its sole or main purpose in making the offers was not to achieve that result. For short, I will refer to the purpose of achieving the prohibited result as the &#8220;prohibited purpose&#8221;. It is, however, important to note that what constitutes the prohibited purpose is defined by reference to what constitutes the prohibited result. For that reason too, although the relevant provisions must be construed as a whole, the primary question must be to identify the nature and scope of the prohibited result.</p>

Certainly, the words &#8220;will no longer&#8221; can only apply in cases where the union is already recognised for the purpose of collective bargaining. But there is nothing in the language used which confines &#8220;will not&#8221; to cases where the union is seeking to be recognised or which ties each alternative in subsection (2) exclusively to one of the alternatives referred to in subsection (1). The alternatives do not even appear in the same order in the two subsections: in subsection (1) a trade union &#8220;seeking to be recognised&#8221; is mentioned after a trade union &#8220;which is recognised&#8221;, but in subsection (2) the words &#8220;will not&#8221; appear before the words &#8220;or will no longer&#8221;.</p>

That may not be true, however, not only where the union is seeking to be recognised but also where a trade union has only recently been recognised by the employer. In that situation the existing terms of employment might have been determined by collective agreement negotiated by or on behalf of another trade union, or they might not have been determined by collective agreement at all (if there was previously no recognised union). It would be irrational to interpret <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B as inapplicable in such circumstances - all the more so when it is expressly applicable where a trade union is seeking to be recognised.

Offers of this kind, if accepted, would clearly have the prohibited result.

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">What if an employer offers a pay rise to workers who are union members conditional on those workers agreeing not to have any changes to their pay and conditions determined by collective bargaining in this particular pay round? Leading counsel for the Company, Andrew Burns QC, agreed that the acceptance of such an offer would have the prohibited result. He was plainly right to do so. There is no difference in principle between offering an inducement to trade union members to agree not to be represented by their union in collective bargaining indefinitely or for a long period or for a very short period of time. In so far as the judgment of the Court of Appeal can be read as suggesting (at para 51) that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B can be contravened only where union members are asked to surrender collective bargaining rights &#8220;on a permanent basis&#8221;, such an interpretation of the section cannot in my view be justified. There would be some basis for it in the language used if, in relation to a recognised trade union, subsection (2) applied only where one or more terms of employment &#8220;will no longer&#8221; be determined by collective agreement. But, as discussed above, the definition of the prohibited result cannot reasonably be interpreted as limited in that way. It also includes cases where the result of accepting an offer would be that a term &#8220;will not&#8221; be determined by collective agreement. No minimum length of time is specified or can reasonably be read into subsection (2) for which that result would have to persist in order to constitute the &#8220;prohibited result&#8221;.</p>

This submission is ambiguous. The reference to &#8220;the material occasion&#8221; could be understood as meaning merely that an offer which, if accepted, would require a union member to agree not to have any term or terms of their employment determined by collective agreement will fall within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B(1)(a) and (2) even if that agreement would be limited to the current pay round (or some other temporary period).

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">On this interpretation, the fact that an offer is made by the employer directly to workers who are trade union members to make changes which have not been collectively agreed to one or more terms of their employment is by itself enough to achieve the prohibited result. The reasoning is that acceptance of such an offer would automatically have the result that the term in question will have been determined by individual agreement at least for the time being, and therefore &#8220;will not (or will no longer) be determined by collective agreement negotiated by or on behalf of the union&#8221; - at least until such time as the term is subsequently varied or replaced by a term negotiated through collective bargaining.

There would have been no need to use and no point in using what, if the claimants&#8217; interpretation is correct, is circuitous and convoluted drafting which requires hypothesising what result acceptance of the offer, together with other workers&#8217; acceptance of offers made to them, would have.</p>

To determine whether that result is the prohibited result defined in subsection (2), it is therefore necessary to look forwards from the notional date of acceptance of the offers to what will or will not happen thereafter. The period during which one or more terms will not be determined by collective agreement may be time-limited or open-ended, but it starts to run when the offers are assumed to have been accepted. It follows logically that the prohibited result is not a result capable of being achieved by the very acceptance of the offers irrespective of what happens afterwards.</p>

It is indeed self-evident that, when an offer is made, any acceptance of the offer must lie in the future. But it is not self-evident whether acceptance of the offer is itself the prohibited result or whether the prohibited result is conceived as something which, if achieved, would post-date - and result from - acceptance of the offer (together with other workers&#8217; acceptance of offers made to them).

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The response given by leading counsel for the claimants, Oliver Segal QC, when this point was raised by Lord Briggs during oral argument, was that the employer could say in such a situation that it was not its sole or main purpose in making the offers to achieve the prohibited result. I do not think this answer adequate for two reasons. First, this argument operates at too late a stage in the analysis. As discussed earlier, the mischief which <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B is aiming in general to prevent or deter is the &#8220;prohibited result&#8221;. Yet I can see no credible reason - and none has been suggested - for seeking to prevent or deter employers from making pay offers directly to their workers when there is no recognised union with whom a collective agreement can be negotiated. Accordingly, there is no reasonable basis for attributing to Parliament the intention that acceptance of such an offer would have the prohibited result. The legality of such an offer therefore cannot rationally depend on the employer having to show what its purpose was in making it. Second, on the claimants&#8217; interpretation of the &#8220;prohibited result&#8221;, relying on the employer&#8217;s purpose to avoid a contravention of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B where the union has not yet been recognised in any event does not work. That is because, as also noted earlier, what constitutes the prohibited purpose depends upon what constitutes the prohibited result. If agreeing terms directly with a worker who is a union member which are not the subject of a collective agreement is ipso facto the prohibited result, I cannot see how the employer could say (at least in general) that it was not its main purpose in making the offers to achieve that result.</p>

	    <content>
	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">A fourth reason for rejecting the claimants&#8217; interpretation is that, if it were correct, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B would have a radical effect going far beyond the aims apparent from the legislative history, and indeed inconsistent with those aims. The consequence would be that, whenever a union refuses to agree to a proposed pay deal or other change to one or more terms of employment so that no collective agreement is reached, the employer could not make a direct offer to its workers without being at serious risk of incurring what may be (if there is a large number of workers) a heavy financial penalty. That is because the offer, if accepted, would automatically achieve the prohibited result. I do not think that the Court of Appeal exaggerated in saying that this would potentially give a recognised trade union an effective veto over any direct offer to any employee concerning any term of the contract, major or minor, on any occasion (see para 53 of the judgment). Whatever view is taken of the merits of such a regime, it would undoubtedly mark a major shift in industrial relations in this country. It would also, as the Court of Appeal observed, go far beyond curing the mischief identified by the European Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Wilson and Palmer</span>. It would be a change of acute political sensitivity which only Parliament could properly make and which would naturally be preceded by public consultation and debate. There is no hint of such a proposal in the pre-Parliamentary and Parliamentary materials leading up to the enactment in 2004 of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52" uk:canonical="1992 c. 52" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1992 Act</ref>.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">The answer to this objection put forward by the claimants is once again to argue that sufficient protection is provided to employers by the possibility of showing that achieving the prohibited result was not the employer&#8217;s sole or main purpose in making the offers. Again, I do not consider this a sufficient answer. First of all, this argument again operates at too late a stage in the analysis. Where an employer has negotiated with the union and the parties have exhausted the procedure for collective bargaining without being able to reach agreement, there is no justification in terms of the policy of UK law for preventing or deterring the employer from at that point making an offer directly to workers. There is accordingly no reasonable basis for attributing to Parliament the intention that acceptance of such an offer would have the prohibited result. Again, therefore, the legality of such an offer cannot rationally depend on the employer having to show what its purpose was in making it. Second, if the acceptance of such an offer is treated as automatically having the prohibited result just because the worker is being invited to accept terms which have not been collectively agreed, showing the purpose in making the offers cannot anyway provide a secure or stable defence to the employer. It could always be said that achieving a change in terms of employment which had not been collectively agreed was the employer&#8217;s main purpose in making the offers. Nor does <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>D(4) provide any basis on which a contrary argument could be made. In particular, subsection (4)(c) could not apply to an offer made generally to the workforce after negotiations with the union had ended without a collective agreement.</p>

Without any clear criteria, however, with which to assess the reasonableness of the employer&#8217;s conduct and motives, this is not a workable test and is incapable of providing the legal certainty which Parliament would naturally expect, and be expected, to provide as to what offers are and are not lawful.</p>

By accepting the offers, workers simply secured a pay rise in return for changes to sick pay, overtime and breaks. Their rights to be represented by Unite in negotiations over pay and conditions and to receive the benefit of any collective agreement were unaffected. Negotiations with Unite in fact continued after the direct offers were made and eventually resulted in a collective agreement for the 2015 pay round reached in November 2016 (see para 11 above). Had that collective agreement been more favourable than the terms of the direct offer which a worker had already accepted, the worker would have received the more favourable terms negotiated with the union. Accordingly, Mr Burns submits, it could not be said when the direct offers were made that their acceptance would have the result that any of the workers&#8217; terms of employment would not be determined by collective agreement.</p>

As Mr Burns QC for the Company put it in oral argument, the right protected by article 11 is a right that the union, when recognised, should be afforded &#8220;a seat at the table&#8221; for the purpose of collective bargaining and permitted to enter into discussions and negotiations with the employer and to be heard by the employer.

It seems to me that it must on any view extend beyond a right not to receive inducements to contract out of union representation. Suppose that in the present case, before having any discussion with representatives of Unite, the Company&#8217;s managers had simply made direct offers to its workers of the kind that were in fact made and had told the union that they wished to see how many workers accepted those offers before deciding whether to engage in collective bargaining. If the right to be represented by the union in negotiations and for the union&#8217;s voice to be heard is to have any substance at all and is not to be entirely empty or illusory, permitting such conduct must be contrary to article 11. That must be so, in my view, even if the offers made to workers who are union members are simply offers of a pay rise along with other changes to their terms of employment and do not require or request the recipients to agree to give up any collective bargaining rights (either indefinitely or at all).</p>

How much discussion or negotiation with the union does the employer need to engage in to satisfy the rights of union members to be represented in collective bargaining and for the union&#8217;s voice to be heard? The case law of the European Court has not addressed this question and there is no doubt in principle room for differences of approach on the part of national authorities. I find it difficult to see, however, what criterion there could be which is not arbitrary, and which is capable of providing legal certainty, other than to define the extent of the collective bargaining required by reference to whatever bargaining procedure has been imposed by the state or agreed between the employer and the union. The fact - where it is the fact - that an agreement with the union was entered into voluntarily and is not legally binding does not alter this. That was the situation in <span style="font-style:italic">Wilson and Palmer</span>. But the absence of a legal obligation on the employers in those cases to enter into collective bargaining did not prevent the rights of trade union members to be represented by the union in the collective bargaining process (which had been voluntarily agreed) from being regarded as &#8220;important union rights&#8221; (see para 48 of the judgment) which were capable of being, and were found to have been, infringed.</p>

In both cases they treat the question whether an offer falls within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B(1)(a) and (2) as depending entirely on the content of the offer. On the claimants&#8217; preferred interpretation, all that matters is whether the offer is to agree a change which has not been collectively agreed with the union to a term or terms of the individual worker&#8217;s contract of employment. On the Company&#8217;s interpretation, all that matters is whether the offer requires the worker to contract out of any collective bargaining rights.</p>

What is prohibited by the section is not the making of an offer which, if accepted, would constitute an agreement with a particular content. Rather, what is prohibited is the making of an offer which, if accepted, would have a particular result. Furthermore, and importantly, that result is not defined as one which follows simply from acceptance of the offer by the worker who is the subject of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B: it takes account additionally of any offers which the employer also makes to other workers and requires consideration of what would happen if <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">all</span> the offers made were accepted. This indicates that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B is concerned not merely with the content of individual offers but with the potential practical consequences of the employer&#8217;s conduct, considered in the round.

Once it is recognised that the question whether the acceptance of offers would have the prohibited &#8220;result&#8221; is a question of causation, it is evident that the state of affairs described in subsection (2) cannot be regarded as the &#8220;result&#8221; of acceptance of the offers if it would inevitably have occurred anyway, irrespective of whether the offers were made and accepted. In that case there would be no causal connection between the presumed acceptance of the offers and the state of affairs described in subsection (2). More specifically, in order for offers made by the employer to workers to be capable of having the prohibited result, there must be at least a real possibility that, if the offers were not made and accepted, the workers&#8217; relevant terms of employment would have been determined by a new collective agreement reached for the period in question. If there is no such possibility, then it cannot be said that making the individual offers has produced the result that the terms of employment have not been determined by collective agreement for that period. In other words, it is implicit in the definition of the prohibited result that the workers&#8217; terms of employment, or any of those terms, will not (or will no longer) be determined by collective agreement negotiated by or on behalf of the union <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">when they otherwise might well have been determined in that way</span>.</p>

If that has been done, it cannot be said that, when the offers were made, there was a real possibility that the matter would have been determined by collective agreement if the offers had not been made and accepted.

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">It was argued on behalf of the Company that it may be difficult to say with certainty whether the collective bargaining process has been exhausted in any particular case and that this interpretation therefore exposes employers to risks which they cannot afford to take and hence would unreasonably restrict their freedom of negotiation. I do not accept this. In my view, employers have two means of protection against that risk. The first is to ensure that the agreement for collective bargaining made with the union clearly defines and delimits the procedure to be followed. The Recognition Agreement made in this case does this sufficiently. I have quoted Stage 4 of the agreed procedure at para 5 above. If in the present case, following the meeting specified at Stage 3, the Company had written to the union representatives stating that the Company did not agree to refer the matter to ACAS, it is clear from the terms of Appendix 1 that the procedure would at that point have been exhausted. A second level of protection is provided by the requirement of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B(1)(b) that the section will not be contravened unless the employer&#8217;s sole or main purpose in making the offers is to achieve the prohibited result. If the employer genuinely believes that the collective bargaining process has been exhausted, it cannot be said that the purpose of making direct offers was to procure the result that terms will not be determined by collective agreement when that otherwise might well have been the case.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">In the present case the Company agreed when it entered into the Recognition Agreement to conduct annual pay negotiations with Unite and to follow the procedure outlined in Appendix 1 before making or proposing any change to terms and conditions of employment outside that process. The offers made directly to employees dishonoured that agreement because they were made before the process had been exhausted. Furthermore, the Company&#8217;s behaviour, potentially at least, treated less favourably employees who were not prepared to relinquish their right to have the agreed procedure for collective bargaining followed. In the case of each direct offer made during the collective bargaining process, the clear message was that, if the employee did not accept it, he would not receive the Christmas bonus (or an equivalent payment) calculated at 2% of basic salary. In the case of the second offer, there was also a threat to terminate the worker&#8217;s contract of employment unless the offer was accepted. It is hard to imagine how, on the assumption required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B(1)(a) that all the direct offers were accepted, the negotiations with Unite could as a matter of practical reality have resulted in a better deal than the one which all the workers would thereby already have accepted individually. On the other hand, there was a real likelihood that any worker who did not accept the direct offers would be left financially worse off. That is indeed what happened, as workers who declined both offers did not receive the Christmas bonus (or any equivalent payment) for 2015. In these circumstances the Company&#8217;s conduct can fairly be characterised as a disincentive or restraint on the use by the claimants of union representation to protect their interests. The relevant use was the exercise of their right to be represented in collective bargaining conducted in accordance with the Recognition Agreement.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in">This case turns on a correct interpretation of certain statutory provisions relating to collective bargaining between a trade union and an employer. The central statutory provisions in question are <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="1992 c. 52 s. 145" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 145</ref>B and 145D of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52" uk:canonical="1992 c. 52" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992</ref> (&#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52" uk:canonical="1992 c. 52" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1992 Act</ref>&#8221;), which were inserted by the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/24" uk:canonical="2004 c. 24" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Employment Relations Act 2004</ref>. Those provisions were part of the Labour Government&#8217;s response to the UK&#8217;s defeat before the European Court of Human Rights (&#8220;ECtHR&#8221;) in <span style="font-style:italic">Wilson and Palmer v United Kingdom</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="(2002) 35 EHRR 20" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">(2002) 35 EHRR 20</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2002] IRLR 568" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2002">[2002] IRLR 568</ref> (&#8220;<span style="font-style:italic">Wilson and Palmer v UK</span>&#8221;). In those cases, employers had offered incentives (by increased pay) to employees to relinquish their contractual rights to have their terms of employment determined by collective bargaining carried out by recognised unions. In one of the cases, the employer had also given notice that it was derecognising the union. The House of Lords had held that the employers&#8217; conduct had not infringed domestic law. But the Strasbourg court decided that the domestic law contravened the employees&#8217; rights under article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights (&#8220;ECHR&#8221;).</p>

In November 2014, there was a ballot with significant support in favour of recognising Unite for the purposes of collective bargaining with Kostal. Subsequently, on 16 February 2015, a &#8220;recognition and procedural agreement&#8221; was signed between Kostal and Unite which gave Unite &#8220;sole recognition and bargaining rights&#8221; (clause 2.1). Clause 3 made clear that the agreement was binding in honour only, rather than legally binding, and that the common objective was to use the processes of negotiation and meaningful consultation to achieve beneficial results for both sides.</p>

First, the employer had no idea how many employees were trade union members and was not therefore aware whether Unite was speaking on behalf of the majority.

As regards the December offer, the ET did not accept that Kostal&#8217;s main purpose was one of ensuring the payment of the Christmas bonus. It was &#8220;somewhat disingenuous&#8221; (point 8.3) for Kostal to say that it made an offer to avert the consequences of a threat which it had itself made; and there was other evidence (in a notice in relation to a subsequent collective bargaining round dated October 2016) that December was not a necessary deadline for the Christmas bonus. As regards the January offer, the ET pointed out that, by then, any Christmas bonus deadline could not possibly apply as a &#8220;benign reason&#8221; (point 8.3). While accepting that a case of union hostility had not been made out, the ET therefore decided that Kostal&#8217;s main purpose was the achievement of the prohibited purpose.

At the other end of the spectrum will be employers who have engaged in lengthy and meaningful collective consultation and reached an impasse before considering making direct offers; or who can demonstrate a strong history of operating collective bargaining arrangements with the union and/or have no wish to avoid entering into such arrangements when the offers are made; and there will be cases where employers can show genuine business reasons (unconnected with collective bargaining) for approaching workers directly outside the collective bargaining process. There may also be difficult cases in the middle where the employer has mixed aims or objectives it seeks to achieve, or the evidence is unclear. The question in each case is a question of fact and degree. As with other detriment cases, where an employer acts reasonably and rationally and has evidence of a genuine alternative purpose, tribunals are likely to be slower to infer an unlawful purpose than in cases where the employer acts unreasonably or irrationally or has no credible alternative purpose.&#8221;</p>

Although inevitably in cases that depend on questions of fact and degree there is less certainty as to the outcome and more risk, we consider that employers who act reasonably and rationally for proper purposes and are able to demonstrate that their primary purpose in making individual offers is a genuine business purpose, retain the ability to make offers directly to their workforce without fear of contravening <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B.&#8221;</p>

It was entitled to reject the Christmas bonus explanation and it was entitled to make three further positive findings of particular relevance. These were as follows. First, the making of the first offers on 10 December 2015 was an immediate reaction to the rejection at ballot of Kostal&#8217;s proposal. Secondly, Kostal&#8217;s true intentions could be gleaned from the general notices published which included the percentage of employees who had already signed acceptances, &#8220;including trade union representatives and members&#8221;, which must have been intended to weaken Unite&#8217;s negotiating position. Thirdly, Kostal took the conscious decision to bypass further meaningful negotiations or contact with the union in favour of a direct and conditional offer to individual employees. The EAT also drew attention to the contextual factors that this was the first collective negotiation process between this employer and this union and there was an ongoing collective negotiation process that was not proceeding in the way Kostal wished it to proceed.

These were the particular employer behaviours that gave rise to the <span style="font-style:italic">Wilson and Palmer</span> case, and they should be made unlawful. The Government intends to make it unlawful for an employer to make an offer to an individual with the main purpose of inducing that person to relinquish rights to belong (or not to belong) to a union, rights to engage in trade union activities or the proposed right to use union services. In addition, offers should be made unlawful whose main purpose is to induce a group of workers, who belong to a recognised union, to accept that their terms of employment should be determined outside collectively agreed procedures. The result is that it would be unlawful for an employer to offer an inducement to the union members in such a group to have their terms of employment determined outside the framework set by any existing collective bargaining arrangements. This limits the scope of employers to offer individualised contracts. To avoid inflexibility however, the law should allow employers to make offers where the sole or main purpose of the inducement is unconnected with the aim of undermining or narrowing the collective bargaining arrangements. In particular, the law should give room for employers and individuals to enter individualised contracts designed to reward or retain key workers.&#8221;</p>

The employer, anxious to have work done on the forthcoming August Bank Holiday, makes a direct offer to workers inviting them to volunteer for work on bank holidays at double time, that is to say for &#163;200 per day.

Mr Wilson was employed by Associated Newspapers Ltd as a news sub-editor on the &#8220;Daily Mail&#8221;. Prior to 1989, the National Union of Journalists (the &#8220;NUJ&#8221;) was recognised by Associated Newspapers Ltd for collective bargaining purposes and had collectively negotiated a &#8220;house agreement&#8221; for the journalists&#8217; terms of employment. In early 1989 Associated Newspapers Ltd gave notice that it was derecognising the NUJ, terminating the house agreement and introducing individual contracts for its journalists. These new individual contracts had substantially the same terms and conditions as the collectively bargained &#8220;house agreement&#8221; contracts save that the journalists who agreed to the individual contracts would receive a 4.5% pay rise. This pay rise was withheld from those who would not sign. However, agreeing to a new individual contract did not prevent a journalist from being a member of the NUJ. A journalist could (and many did) remain a member of the NUJ once they had moved to an individual contract. Mr Wilson refused to sign the new individual contract. He brought a claim alleging that Associated Newspapers Ltd had infringed his rights, under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/44/section/23/1" uk:canonical="1978 c. 44 s. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23(1)</ref>(a) of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/44" uk:canonical="1978 c. 44" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978</ref>, not to have action taken against him individually for the purpose of preventing or deterring him from being a member of an independent trade union. The facts of the linked appeal, in the <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer</span> case, were significantly similar, with the exception that the union in question, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, was not derecognised.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">The House of Lords heard both appeals together. Overturning the Court of Appeal, it held that neither employer had infringed <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/44/section/23/1" uk:canonical="1978 c. 44 s. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23(1)</ref>(a). The court&#8217;s reasoning addressed two main issues: first, whether an employer&#8217;s omission to confer a benefit on an employee could constitute an action against an individual within the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/44/section/23/1" uk:canonical="1978 c. 44 s. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23(1)</ref>(a); and second, and in the alternative, whether the employer&#8217;s actions were taken for the purpose of preventing or deterring the employees from being members of a trade union. Lord Bridge of Harwich gave the leading judgment on the first issue, with which Lord Keith of Kinkel and Lord Browne-Wilkinson agreed. He held that the term &#8220;action&#8221; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/44/section/23/1" uk:canonical="1978 c. 44 s. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23(1)</ref>(a) could not encompass an omission. Withholding from Mr Wilson and Mr Palmer a pay rise conferred on their respective colleagues, whatever the purpose of granting that pay rise may have been, could not amount to a contravention of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/44/section/23/1" uk:canonical="1978 c. 44 s. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 23(1)</ref>(a). Lord Lloyd of Berwick gave the lead judgment on the second, alternative, issue, with which Lord Bridge, Lord Keith and Lord Slynn of Hadley agreed. He held that the employees did not have a right to be represented by a union in negotiations with their employer. <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1978/44/section/23/1" uk:canonical="1978 c. 44 s. 23" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 23(1)</ref>(a) protected only the right to associate as a member of a trade union ie the right to be a member of a union per se, and not any right to make use of any particular essential services of the union (such as collective representation in contract negotiations with an employer).</p>

It is therefore first crucial to clarify the approach we must take. The modern approach to statutory interpretation requires the courts to ascertain the meaning of the words in a statute in the light of their context and purpose (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Uber BV v Aslam</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2021/5" uk:canonical="[2021] UKSC 5" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] UKSC 5</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2021] ICR 657" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] ICR 657</ref>, para 70; <span style="font-style:italic">Rittson-Thomas v Oxfordshire County Council</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/uksc/2021/13" uk:canonical="[2021] UKSC 13" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] UKSC 13</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2021] 2 WLR 993" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2021">[2021] 2 WLR 993</ref>, para 33). In carrying out their interpretative role, the courts can look not only at the statute but also, for example, at the explanatory notes to the statute, at relevant consultation papers, and, within the parameters set by <span style="font-style:italic">Pepper v Hart</span><ref href="#" uk:canonical="[1993] AC 593" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="1993">[1993] AC 593</ref>, at ministerial statements reported in <span style="font-style:italic">Hansard</span>.

This was to support his submission that, in the case of a recognised union, the relevant words were &#8220;will no longer&#8221; which supported the interpretation that one was concerned with workers relinquishing their rights in the future to have their terms of employment determined by collective bargaining (ie that the workers were &#8220;contracting out&#8221; of collective bargaining). We are not convinced that it is permissible to consider previous versions of the Bill that became law. But even if we were to take those earlier versions into account, we do not think that it takes matters much further. In particular, it would be very odd, if Mr Burns&#8217; submission were correct, for the words applicable to the standard situation of a recognised union (&#8220;will no longer&#8221;) to be relegated to brackets.</p>

A literal interpretation - so that offers of individual agreements with workers (who are members of a recognised trade union or a trade union seeking recognition) on any terms of employment would automatically mean that the employer&#8217;s main purpose is to achieve the prohibited result - would leave no scope for the idea that the employer does not infringe <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/24/section/145" uk:canonical="2004 c. 24 s. 145" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B if the employer has a genuine business purpose.

In other words, the employer does not have the main purpose of achieving the prohibited result where the employer has a genuine business purpose.

Here the House of Lords had to interpret the &#8220;proper purpose&#8221; defence to a statutory prohibition on a company giving financial assistance in connection with the purchase of its own shares. The company must show that its principal purpose was not to assist the acquisition or was an incidental part of some larger purpose of the company: see now <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46/section/679" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46 s. 679" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 679</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2006/46" uk:canonical="2006 c. 46" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Companies Act 2006</ref>. The issue was whether as a result of the share acquisition, which the company financially assisted, the company would cease to be subject to management deadlock and would therefore have the benefit of better management. The House acknowledged the difficulty of interpreting &#8220;purpose&#8221;. It held that the prohibition and the &#8220;proper purpose&#8221; defence had to be read together within the &#8220;fasciculus&#8221; or series of sections in which they appear and each had to have a &#8220;useful application&#8221;. Moreover, the proper purpose had to be independent of achieving the prohibited result and not merely a &#8220;by-product&#8221; of it: see pp 779-780, per Lord Oliver of Aylmerton, with whom the other members of the House agreed. So too here, the scope of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B(1)(b) has to be understood within the series of sections within which it appears. On this basis we consider that what it means is that, if the employer is to be excused, the employer must show that its sole or main purpose was to achieve something other than the prohibited result (ie that the employer has a genuine business purpose).</p>

If the law were concerned with an offer made to just one relevant worker, that worker&#8217;s hypothetical acceptance, viewed in isolation, would constitute a waiver of any wrong to that worker and would have no impact on collective bargaining.

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">The approach taken by the Court of Appeal produces an extremely narrow interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="1992 c. 52 s. 145" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B. Mr Burns&#8217; primary submission was that the prohibited result is one where the offer is for the workers to &#8220;contract out&#8221; of collective bargaining. That can apply equally to a union seeking recognition as to a union that is already recognised. But even Mr Burns conceded that there can be a contracting out of collective bargaining, with a recognised union, on a temporary one-off basis. So had Kostal here offered the workers the disputed package of terms in return for their expressly giving up their right to have their terms of employment determined by collective bargaining for the 2015 round, Mr Burns accepted that that would have been covered by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/24/section/145" uk:canonical="2004 c. 24 s. 145" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B. We consider that he was obviously correct to have made that concession. There would be no valid reason to distinguish a long-term (or permanent) contracting out of collective bargaining from a one-off contracting out of collective bargaining.

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">Once one accepts that express contracting out of collective bargaining on a temporary one-off basis must be covered, three important consequences follow. First, the main reasoning of the Court of Appeal cannot be sustained. That reasoning explicitly rejected a third type of case where, &#8220;on this one occasion&#8221;, the workers&#8217; terms will not be determined by collective agreement. Secondly, the words &#8220;will not&#8221; in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B(2) are being applied to a recognised trade union ie &#8220;the prohibited result is that the workers&#8217; terms of employment, or any of those terms, will not [<span style="font-style:italic">on this occasion</span>] be determined by collective agreement negotiated by or on behalf of the union.&#8221; (bracketed emphasised words inserted). This contradicts the view, otherwise submitted by Mr Burns, that the words &#8220;will not&#8221; apply only to unions seeking recognition and &#8220;will no longer&#8221; applies only to recognised unions. Thirdly, and most importantly, one inevitably must consider whether the facts of this case constitute, in substance if not in form, the contracting out of collective bargaining on this occasion. It cannot be correct - and would amount to an unacceptable triumph of form over substance - if only offers expressly referring to contracting out of collective bargaining on this occasion were covered.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">The facts of this case did constitute the contracting out of collective bargaining on this occasion so that the acceptance of the offers would achieve the prohibited result. Although Kostal did not make any express reference to collective bargaining in its offers, acceptance of the offers being made would mean that, on this occasion, as found by the ET, the relevant workers&#8217; terms of employment would not be determined by collective agreement. The important passages from the ET&#8217;s judgment set out at para 94 above, make clear that, even though collective bargaining continued until it was concluded on 3 November 2016 (see para 89 above), the individuals who had accepted one or other of the individual offers had already had their terms determined on the basis of the individual agreement rather than that considerably later collective agreement. That document was purporting to record a collective agreement in circumstances where the terms and conditions had for some time been governed by variations agreed individually. This is consistent with the interpretation of the &#8220;prohibited result&#8221; that we have put forward in para 116 above. Furthermore, as the ET put it, Kostal&#8217;s commitment to collective bargaining was &#8220;little more than window dressing&#8221; as it had already &#8220;destroyed the union&#8217;s mandate&#8221;.

Once one reaches the conclusion that, on these facts, the prohibited result would be achieved by the acceptance of the offers (ie these facts did constitute contracting out on this occasion), the findings of fact of the ET (set out at para 95 above), as upheld by the EAT, are determinative in relation to Kostal&#8217;s main purpose being to achieve that prohibited result (ie that Kostal did not have a genuine business purpose).

As has been set out at para 95 above, although Kostal purported to be seeking to ensure that a Christmas bonus would be paid to employees, the ET found that Kostal took a conscious decision to by-pass further meaningful negotiations and contact with the union in favour of a direct and conditional offer to individual employees. This was not a case where an impasse had been reached. On the contrary, Kostal abandoned the agreed procedures before stage 4 (the reference to ACAS) had been attempted. Bogg and Ewing (2021) 50 ILJ 125, 126, make this point forcefully in criticising Bowers for having said that Kostal had engaged in an &#8220;exhaustive succession of discussions with the union&#8221;:</p>

If we were to dismiss this appeal, employers would be advised that, provided they do not expressly mention in individual offers that the workers must give up or surrender rights to have terms fixed by collective bargaining, and provided they continue to show commitment to collective bargaining by little more than what the ET described as &#8220;window dressing&#8221; (see para 94 above), they can avoid being in breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/24/section/145" uk:canonical="2004 c. 24 s. 145" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B. Although strongly supportive of the Court of Appeal&#8217;s approach, Bowers (2020) 136 LQR 186, 191, recognised the reality that that approach would render it very difficult to establish a breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B:</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">A further difficulty with any narrow interpretation that would require a worker to wait and see how collective bargaining might in future progress is that the wrong in question is committed by the making of the offer. Under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>C(1)(a), the worker to whom the offer is made then has a limitation period of three months to bring a claim (or, if the offer is part of a series of similar offers to the complainant, the three months runs from when the last of them was made). By <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>C(1)(b), this is subject to the time limit running from such later date as considered reasonable by the tribunal &#8220;where the tribunal is satisfied that it was not reasonably practicable for the complaint to be presented before the end of that period&#8221;. Apart from the possibility of a tribunal applying that exception in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/24/section/145" uk:canonical="2004 c. 24 s. 145" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>C(1)(b), the short limitation period would plainly render it problematic for a worker to wait and see how any collective bargaining might progress. This was a point clearly and correctly made by Simler J at para 54:</p>

	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;[I]t must be possible for a worker to determine what the effect of acceptance would be within the time limit prescribed. The approach we adopt allows that and creates a coherent scheme. On the other hand, absent an express statement as to the effect of acceptance of the offers on collective bargaining, if the effect of acceptance is only to be judged at some future unidentified date such as the next collective bargaining round, the time limits are unworkable (and not merely difficult, as Mr Burns concedes). On Mr Burns&#8217; construction, the worker would have to put in a complaint before necessarily knowing the outcome of the next bargaining round (which could be a year away) and therefore without knowing what effect acceptance would have. As Mr Burns put it, the worker would have to decide whether the unexpressed intention (and effect) of the offer if accepted would be for one or more terms of employment to be determined outside collective bargaining in the next collective bargaining round, irrespective of the immediate effect of acceptance on terms of employment. That to our minds is unworkable.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">With respect, there are two linked additional flaws in the Court of Appeal&#8217;s reasoning. First, it is misleading to portray the union as having a veto over the negotiation of any terms with individuals. As we have made clear, where the employer&#8217;s main motive for individual negotiation is a genuine business purpose, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B does not prevent offers to individuals. A genuine business purpose includes rewarding particular employees with incentive pay and seeking to retain particular employees (both of which, as we have seen, are expressly set out as being permitted in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/24/section/145" uk:canonical="2004 c. 24 s. 145" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>D); and the need to meet urgent business demands. Secondly, Bean LJ&#8217;s hypothetical example set out at para 103 above is problematic because one needs to know more facts in order to determine whether this would constitute an infringement of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/24/section/145" uk:canonical="2004 c. 24 s. 145" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B or not. For example, if there were urgent business demands requiring work to be done on the August Bank holiday, there would probably be no breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/24/section/145" uk:canonical="2004 c. 24 s. 145" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B. The employer would have a genuine business purpose for the offers and its main purpose would not be to bypass the collective bargaining procedures. Bogg and Ewing (2020) 49 ILJ 430, 456, make a similar point:</p>

	      <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.00in">&#8220;In our view, it is not at all clear that [Bean LJ&#8217;s] example constitutes a breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B on the EAT&#8217;s broader interpretation. We do not know enough about the facts Bean LJ had in mind to make that determination. In a situation where the employer had exhausted the negotiation procedures provided for in the recognition agreement, hence this was a genuine impasse at the end of the agreed process, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>D might suggest that this was not a prohibited purpose.&#8221;</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">It is also our view that the Court of Appeal misinterpreted Simler J when it suggested, at para 43, that she had said, in the last sentence in para 61 (set out at para 97(iv) above), that &#8220;an employer who has acted &#8216;reasonably and rationally&#8217; will not be liable&#8221;. Simler J was not saying that. All she was saying, correctly, was that, in assessing an employer&#8217;s main purpose, an employer is more likely to be found to have a genuine business purpose, the more reasonable and rational its conduct has been.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">It is important to stress that, on the facts of this case, we need go no further than deciding that an employer is in breach of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B: (i) where an offer, if accepted, would constitute contracting out of collective bargaining on this occasion, so that that offer falls within the prohibition in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>B as satisfying the &#8220;prohibited result&#8221; requirement; and (ii) where the employer&#8217;s main purpose was to achieve that result rather than having a genuine business purpose (and the factual findings of the ET are determinative on that). We do not think it would be helpful to speculate as to what the position would be on other hypothetical facts. But in applying the statutory provisions we think it is useful always to have in mind the following two questions:</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">One point raised at the hearing was how precisely these statutory provisions operate where the relevant trade union is seeking recognition but has not yet been recognised. It is unnecessary for us to decide this but we see no difficulty in applying the provisions in the way that we have explained above. We have explained above, at para 116, that one needs an existing <span style="font-style:italic">or envisaged</span> collective agreement in order to establish the &#8220;prohibited result&#8221;. Plainly an offer requiring the trade union member (even though the trade union is merely seeking recognition), formally to contract out of a future collective agreement would be covered. But assuming that, even in this context, the prohibited result may extend beyond that formal contracting out, the employer is, as ever, excused where it has a genuine business purpose. And, although we are hesitant to speculate without facts, one can readily anticipate that, where a trade union is only at the stage of seeking recognition, it is likely to be easier for the employer to establish that it has a genuine business purpose than where a union has already been recognised.</p>

	      <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">Since writing this judgment we have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Lord Leggatt (with whom Lord Briggs and Lord Kitchin agree). While we agree with the decision that he reaches in this case, it will be apparent from our judgment that we take a different interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 145</ref>B and 145D which does not turn on considering the causal question as to whether there was a real possibility that, if the offers had not been made and accepted, the workers&#8217; relevant terms of employment would have been determined by a new collective agreement reached for the period in question (see Lord Leggatt&#8217;s judgment at para 65). We have explained above (see in particular paras 113 and 116) what we consider to be the correct interpretation of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2004/24/section/145" uk:canonical="2004 c. 24 s. 145" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">sections 145</ref>B and 145D. On our interpretation, contrary to Lord Leggatt&#8217;s approach (see his judgment at para 67), it does not necessarily follow that the employer escapes liability just because the collective bargaining process for this round has been exhausted. For example, an employer who has been determined to thwart the bargaining process does not have a genuine business purpose (and indeed would fall within <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1992/52/section/145" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 145</ref>D(4)(a)). Nor, as we indicate at para 125 of our judgment, do we share Lord Leggatt&#8217;s criticism (see para 47 of his judgment) of the emphasis on reasonableness, which the EAT held would apply in assessing the employer&#8217;s purpose. We do not accept that a reasonableness test without precise criteria is unworkable. For example, a test of whether the employer has acted within &#8220;a band or range of reasonable responses&#8221; to an employee&#8217;s misconduct is applied in the context of unfair dismissal (see, eg, <span style="font-style:italic">Graham v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions</span><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/civ/2012/903" uk:canonical="[2012] EWCA Civ 903" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] EWCA Civ 903</ref>; <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2012] IRLR 759" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2012">[2012] IRLR 759</ref>, para 36). In general terms, we consider, with respect, that the words, context and purpose of the statutory provisions lead to the interpretation we favour rather than that put forward by Lord Leggatt.</p>
