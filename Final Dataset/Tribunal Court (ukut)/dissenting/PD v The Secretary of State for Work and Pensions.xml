The First-tier Tribunal has thus expressly addressed the requirements of regulation 4(2A) and 7 of the PIP Regulations and has reached conclusions that seem to me to have been open to it on the facts and not arguably perverse.</span></p>

It did not overstate his evidence about the Spanish holiday, but took it into account alongside the other evidence. There was nothing wrong with the Tribunal taking the mere fact of the holiday with a friend into account in relation to this activity as his ability to engage with a friend in a public place such as a bar or restaurant is relevant to his ability to engage with other people face to face, applying authorities such as </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">HA v SSWP (PIP) </span><span style="font-family:Arial"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukut/aac/2018/56" uk:canonical="[2018] UKUT 56 (AAC)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2018">[2018] UKUT 56 (AAC)</ref>. The Tribunal recognised he was more restricted in engaging with people outside his immediate family and friendship circle, but drew the conclusion that he was (or would be) able to do this when necessary, given his ability to engage with GP, taxis, and so on. Although a different Tribunal might have reached a different conclusion, this Tribunal&#8217;s decision was, it seems to me, not arguably in error of law.</span></p>

The First-tier Tribunal recognised the greater difficulty that the appellant was likely to have with unfamiliar journeys, and that the holiday to Spain had been with a friend so did not provide evidence of ability to plan and follow journeys unaided. However, the First-tier Tribunal was entitled to reach a conclusion having considered all the evidence, including drawing inferences as to which the appellant would be able to do if necessary. The Tribunal is not required to record and deal with every part of the appellant&#8217;s oral and written evidence. The passage quoted in the grounds of appeal does not contradict what he said to the HCP in any event: it just says that he &#8216;tries to avoid&#8217; public transport&#8217;, not that he never uses it. Again, while a different Tribunal might reach a different conclusion, the decision of this Tribunal was not arguably erroneous in law.</span></p>

The definition of &#8220;reasonable time period&#8221; in regulation 4(4) is &#8220;no more than twice as long as the maximum period that a person without a physical or mental condition which limits that person&#8217;s ability to carry out the activity in question would normally take to complete that activity&#8221;. Although the First-tier Tribunal set out that provision in its SoR, it is arguable that it failed properly to apply it. The appellant&#8217;s evidence at the hearing, according to his representative, was to the effect that his walking speed is substantially longer than twice that of a &#8216;normal&#8217; person. The First-tier Tribunal has failed to address this evidence in its decision, and has not explained how it concluded that the appellant could walk the necessary distances within a reasonable time period bearing in mind the proper definition of that term. This may be a material error because if he is going less than half the speed of a &#8216;normal&#8217; person when covering 20-50m, he would score 8 points.  </span></p>

Given that the FtT&#8217;s acceptance of the claimed difficulties with mobilising, and that they have noted that he is slower, it is my submission that this is a further error in law and further fact finding is required to establish if the claimant is able to mobilise in accordance with Regulation 4(4). </span></p>

By way of example, whilst noting at paragraph 31 of the SOR the FtT accept that journey&#8217;s are </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">&#8220;more physically challenging due to fatigue and shortness of breath&#8221;, </span><span style="font-family:Arial">and accept at paragraph 34 that they; &#8220;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">that swelling of the legs, fatigue and shortness of breath does impact upon [claimant&#8217;s] ability&#8230;&#8221; </span><span style="font-family:Arial">but then go onto state</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">:  &#8220;but note the ability to move around does not have to be completely symptom free. &#8230;It was accepted that he wore compression stockings to assist with the swelling. However, the Tribunal concluded that [claimant] did not have sufficient physical restrictions that would prevent him from walking 200 metres or more safely, to an acceptable standard, repeatedly and within a reasonable time period.</span><span style="font-family:Arial">&#8221;.</span><marker name="tab"/><span style="font-family:Arial"> It is unclear how the claimant would do this in a reasonable time. The reasons given by the FtT when stating that the extent and resulting limitations were indicated in the points awarded without further findings of fact, do not, I submit, constitute adequate reasons for the findings of the FtT in this area.</span></p>
