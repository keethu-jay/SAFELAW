	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.92in;text-indent:0.5in">This is an appeal by the Claimant against conclusions of Employment Judge K Andrews sitting in the London South Employment Tribunal following a preliminary hearing dealing with various issues held on 22 July 2022.  In a Judgment sent out on 30 August 2022 the EJ found that the Claimant was an employee of the Respondent only during the period 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019 and that she could not, therefore, pursue claims of unfair dismissal or breach of contract arising from a claimed dismissal on 30 April 2020. However, claims of race discrimination and victimisation based on that same dismissal and a Respondent&#8217;s Counterclaim were allowed to continue.</p>

That engagement was based on a written contract which described her as a consultant and she was working on a specific pilot project relating to Syria. She was paid a fee, she had no fixed hours and she was given space, as she put it, to carry out her role. The underlying pilot project ended at the same time as the contract and the Claimant accepted in evidence that at that stage there was no obligation on the Respondent to provide any further work.</p>

She was not paid for producing this action plan. However, she provided further help with it and was in due course paid a lump sum for her work on 28 November 2018. Between 28 November and 31 December 2018, she did no paid work for the Respondent.</p>

In that contract the Claimant was described as a research manager and referred to as an employee. At this stage the Claimant was, as the EJ found, somewhat more integrated into the team and the contract was one of service or employment, a conclusion which is not challenged.</p>

This was on the advice of her accountants for tax purposes as a vehicle for her to provide research services to the Respondent and others. She was the sole director and shareholder of the company. As I describe in more detail below, the EJ also recorded that she was the sole employee of the company. Her tax returns submitted to HMRC showed her as self-employed.</p>

A draft contract was prepared between the Respondent and the Claimant&#8217;s company to commence on 1 January 2020. The company was described in this draft as a service provider. That first draft was not signed and continued to be the subject of negotiation. Meanwhile nothing changed on the ground save that the compensation package was paid into the Claimant&#8217;s company&#8217;s bank account. At paragraph 36 of the EJ&#8217;s Judgment she recorded this:</p>

My reading of that paragraph is that the Claimant worked more for the Respondent in 2020 than she had previously.  In March 2020 she had an employee performance evaluation, and she was referred to in the summary of the outcome as an employee.</p>

This version stated the period of the contract as being 1 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and this time described RouaT Limited as a contractor. Following expressions of disappointment from the Claimant at the end date of 30 April 2020 the Respondent confirmed in due course that the contract between the Respondent and RouaT would indeed come to an end on 30 April 2020.</p>

She also claimed breach of contract and race discrimination and victimisation arising out of her dismissal on 30 April 2020. It was conceded by the Respondent that she was a &#8220;worker&#8221; and that there was, therefore, jurisdiction to entertain her claims of race discrimination and victimisation under the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref>.</p>

The employer maintained as recorded by the EAT at paragraph 12 of the Judgment that the formation of a limited company had the effect of creating a separate legal entity which operated between the putative employer and the claimant. He, the claimant, was, therefore, trading by means of a limited company, a special entity in law, the existence of which <span style="font-style:italic">ipso facto</span> meant that he could no longer be regarded as an employee of the respondent in the ET.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;margin-right:-0.93in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Smith&#8217;s answer to this point when I put it to him was to say that, in order to come within the extended definition of an &#8220;employee&#8221;, it is not necessary for the contract &#8220;personally to do work&#8221; to be a contract between the worker and the respondent accused of discrimination. However, on considering Part 5 of the EqA, the definition in section 83 and the fact that the rights in section 39 of the EqA are rights specifically against employers as defined, it does not seem to me that that answer can be right.  A claimant under section 39 has to be, in my view, in a contractual relationship with the respondent to the claim. Thus, the Respondent&#8217;s concession that the Claimant is a &#8220;worker&#8221; (as it was put) and that she is accordingly able to make a claim of discrimination against the Respondent does involve, in my view, a concession that there was a contract between the Respondent and the Claimant that she would personally do work. It seems to me that this is arguably inconsistent with her simultaneously being an employee of her own company.

In light of my conclusion on Ground 1 I do not need to consider this ground in detail, but I do not think in itself it provides a proper ground for appeal. The only public policy apparently relied on is that workers should not be deprived of the protections which Parliament has intended them to receive under the <span style="font-weight:bold">Employment Rights Act</span>. As I pointed out in argument, not all workers are entitled to those protections and this is for all sorts of reasons including that they are not an employee of the person they are claiming against or that they have not been employed for long enough. Just because a worker has identified a possible respondent to claim against does not mean that she must be entitled to claim under the ERA. If the true position in this case is that, for whatever reason, the Claimant was no longer an employee of the Respondent in 2020, she cannot bring a claim of unfair dismissal against the Respondent.  Public policy does not require the Tribunal to say that she can just because there is no one else she can claim against.  I therefore dismiss ground 2.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-right:-0.93in">I also refer back to earlier factual findings.  At paragraph 21 the judge had recorded that the Claimant was engaged on a fixed term contract which was headed <span style="font-style:italic">Consultancy Agreement</span> and described her as a consultant. At paragraph 22 they recorded that she had no fixed working hours during this contract and it was &#8220;task based&#8221; and she used her personal email address for communications.  Further, at paragraph 30 the Tribunal recorded that in the 2019 agreement she was referred to as an employee. In paragraph 33 they record that she managed a team of researchers and represented the Respondent externally, both in person and on social media. In comparison to 2018 the Claimant was required to work full time fixed hours and was given the Respondent&#8217;s email address.  Those were all relevant findings.</p>

The EJ found that the Claimant was working for the Respondent from 1 March 2018 to 31 August 2018, working for the Respondent during October and November 2018, and then working for the Respondent from 1 January 2019 to 30 April 2020. Mr Smith expressly accepts that the breaks in continuity in September 2018 and December 2018 were on account of a &#8220;&#8230; cessation of work&#8221; (to quote the relevant words in section 212(3)(b) of the ERA); the issue was whether those breaks were &#8220;temporary&#8221; cessations of work.</p>

Further, the judge failed to carry out an exercise of looking back and considering the gaps in the context of the whole of the work the Claimant had done for the Respondent. Further, if she had considered the expectations of the parties in August 2018 in this context, she should have referred back to her finding at paragraph 24 of the Judgment which was that:</heading>
