	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The issue in this case is the proper approach of the immigration appellate authorities where the Secretary of State has decided that a national of the European Economic Area who is lawfully living in the United Kingdom should be removed on the ground of abuse of the right to reside here. The abuse in question happened to be an alleged attempt to enter into a &#8220;marriage of convenience&#8221; but the issue would arise in respect of any abuse which would justify removal under article 35 of Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States (&#8220;the Directive&#8221;).</p>

She came to this country lawfully in February 2007 and has since been living and working here lawfully, exercising her rights under the Directive. She lives in Edinburgh, where her sisters also live, and works as a cleaner. Mr Malik is a citizen of Pakistan who came to this country lawfully with a Tier 4 student visa in May 2011. His visa expired on 15 April 2013 and he has been here unlawfully ever since. He too lives and worked in Edinburgh until 17 April 2014.</p>

They spent that night together and saw one another from time to time afterwards, meeting members of one another&#8217;s families, but the relationship did not become a steady one until Valentine&#8217;s Day 2013. Thereafter, they say, they saw one another as boyfriend and girlfriend. It is common ground (and there is photographic evidence) that in December 2013, Mr Malik attended the wedding of Ms Sadovska&#8217;s sister and that they were on the streets of Edinburgh together during the celebrations at Hogmanay 2013. It is also common ground that Mr Malik booked a double room for two adults at a London hotel for four nights in January 2014 and that they were both in London at that time. They say that they were on holiday together and that was when they decided to get married.</p>

This explained that their client was an over-stayer, but that he intended to marry an EEA national on 17 April 2014 and would be applying for recognition that he was exercising Treaty rights as a family member of an EEA national, so it was hoped that no enforcement action would be taken against him. The letter recognised that officials might wish to interview their clients but hoped that this could be done before their wedding on 17 April. It also stated that:</p>

The wedding was due to take place on the afternoon of the following Thursday. Before that could happen, however, immigration officers arrived at the Registrar&#8217;s Office and asked to interview them. They agreed. Each was cautioned and agreed to be interviewed in English. They were interviewed separately, Mr Malik from 14.55 to 16.20 and Ms Sadovska from 14.54 to 16.50, according to the immigration officers&#8217; records. After the interviews they were detained and thus unable to marry. Ms Sadovska was released soon afterwards, but Mr Malik was detained until 11 June. On the same day as the interviews, each was issued with a two part decision notice.</p>

The notice referred to regulation 19(3)(c), without explaining that this was contained in the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2006. At the time, this provided that &#8220;&#8230; an EEA national who has entered the United Kingdom ... may be removed if &#8230; (c) the Secretary of State has decided that the person&#8217;s removal is justified on grounds of abuse of rights in accordance with regulation 21B(2)&#8221;. Regulation 21B(1) provided that &#8220;The abuse of a right to reside includes &#8230; (c) entering, attempting to enter or assisting another person to enter or attempt to enter, a marriage or civil partnership of convenience&#8221;. Regulation 21B(2) provided that &#8220;The Secretary of State may take an EEA decision on the grounds of abuse of rights where there are reasonable grounds to suspect the abuse of a right to reside and it is proportionate to do so&#8221;. Regulation 24(2) provided that where a decision to remove was taken under regulation 19(3)(c), the person was to be treated as someone to whom <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33/section/10/1" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 10(1)</ref>(a) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1999/33" uk:canonical="1999 c. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1999 Act</ref> applied.</p>

There was no burden on the claimant in an application for a family permit to establish that she was not party to a marriage of convenience unless the circumstances known to the decision-maker gave reasonable ground for suspecting that that was the case. Where there was such a suspicion the matter required further investigation and the claimant should be invited to respond to by producing evidential material to dispel it (para 27). But suspicion was not enough. The claimant was only disqualified if it was established that the marriage was one of convenience (para 37).

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is clear from the provisions of the Directive quoted above that Ms Sadovska has a right of permanent residence in the United Kingdom. As an EU citizen, under article 27.1, her freedom of movement can only be restricted on grounds of public policy, public security or public health. As a permanent resident, under article 28 she could only be removed if those grounds are serious. It is not suggested that she can be removed under article 28 on any of those grounds. She can therefore only be removed, under article 35, if it is established that she has entered, or attempted to enter, into a marriage of convenience. Furthermore, although the Regulations permit the respondent to take steps on the basis of reasonable grounds to suspect that that is the case, Ms Sadovska is entitled to an appeal where the facts and circumstances must be fully investigated. That must mean, as held in <span style="font-style:italic">Papajorgji</span>, that the tribunal has to form its own view of the facts from the evidence presented. The respondent is seeking to take away established rights. One of the most basic rules of litigation is that he who asserts must prove. It was not for Ms Sadovska to establish that the relationship was a genuine and lasting one. It was for the respondent to establish that it was indeed a marriage of convenience.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">For this purpose, &#8220;marriage of convenience&#8221; is a term of art. Although it is defined in the Directive and the 2009 Communication as a marriage the <span style="font-style:italic">sole</span> purpose of which is to gain rights of entry to and residence in the European Union, the 2014 Handbook suggests a more flexible approach, in which this must be the <span style="font-style:italic">predominant</span> purpose. It is not enough that the marriage may bring incidental immigration and other benefits if this is not its predominant purpose. Furthermore, except in cases of deceit by the non-EU national, this must be the purpose of them <span style="font-style:italic">both</span>. Clearly, a non-EU national may be guilty of abuse when the EU national is not, because she believes that it is a genuine relationship.</p>

So it would be one thing to find that the proposed marriage had been shown to be one of convenience, and therefore that it was right to prevent it, but quite another thing to find that expelling Ms Sadovska from the country where she had lived and worked for so long and had other family members living was a proportionate response to that.</p>

She had established rights and it was for the respondent to prove that the quite narrow grounds existed for taking them away. Nor did the determination address the issue of proportionality.

In order to benefit from the Directive, he would have to show that he has a &#8220;durable relationship&#8221; with Ms Sadovska. However, article 3.2 requires the respondent to justify any refusal of entry or residence in such cases. So if he can produce evidence of a &#8220;durable relationship&#8221; (a term which is not defined in the Directive), it would be for the respondent to show that it was not or that there were other good reasons to deny him entry.</p>

In seeking to establish its case, the respondent will no doubt concentrate on the interviews, the discrepancies between the appellants&#8217; accounts, and the gaps in Ms Sadovska&#8217;s knowledge of Mr Malik&#8217;s family, together with the sentence in their statement of 28 March that their thoughts of living together and marriage had not yet &#8220;manifested into action&#8221; (which on 28 March was strictly true in that they were not yet living together or married but they had given notice of intention to marry). But in considering those discrepancies, the circumstances in which the interviews took place and the statement was made must be borne fully in mind. Furthermore, there were many matters on which their accounts were consistent. It turns out, for example, that Ms Sadovska&#8217;s mother does indeed live in Lithuania, as Mr Malik said in explaining why she was not there. There is also a considerable body of evidence which supports their claim to have been in a genuine relationship, dating back some time before they gave notice of intention to marry. Should the tribunal conclude that Mr Malik was delighted to find an EU national with whom he could form a relationship and who was willing to marry him, that does not necessarily mean that their marriage was a &#8220;marriage of convenience&#8221;, still less that Ms Sadovska was abusing her rights in entering into it. Their legal and their factual cases must be considered separately.</p>

But for my part I would not accept their argument that, because their marriage was frustrated by the respondent&#8217;s actions, their case should be approached as if they were married, which would, of course, enhance Mr Malik&#8217;s claims. It must be permissible for the state to take steps to prevent sham marriages, although it is also incumbent on the state to show that the marriage would indeed be a sham.</p>
