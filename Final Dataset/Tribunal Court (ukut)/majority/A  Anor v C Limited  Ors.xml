Following a meeting, at which he denied physical harassment, but admitted to some alleged comments, Mr E was demoted.  He appealed.  Ms B raised the matter again, providing a supporting statement from Mr A.  She subsequently provided further corroborating evidence.  There was no investigation and no response to her grievance.  On her return from holiday on 13 August she was told that Mr E was being given a second chance.  He met with Ms B and said that he had learned from his mistakes and apologised.  He went on to say: &#8220;Oh God, this is like couples therapy.&#8221;</span></p>

Around 21 August 2018 there was a desk move, which the tribunal found was done in order to separate Ms A and Mr B, because they were perceived to be communicating too much with each other and not the rest of the team.  Mr A was also given an informal performance warning.  On 24 August Ms B, and on 30 August Mr A, went on leave.  They both returned on 11 September, whereupon both were suspended.  They were told this was in relation to conduct issues.  Ms B suffered a panic attack and had to attend her GP.  Because she was unwell an investigation meeting with her the next day was put off.  She remained suspended.</span></p>

It advised that he should be given a copy of the report.  However, Mr A was not told of, or given, the report, nor a letter of concern.  Mr A and Ms B remained suspended. </span></p>

The tribunal found that the main reason for the resignations was the &#8220;campaign&#8221; of harassment, discrimination and victimisation, that particularly Ms B had suffered, and, to a lesser extent, also Mr A, who had supported her.</span></p>

However, in the liability decision, the tribunal found that neither Ms B, nor Mr A or other witnesses she named, were interviewed, no action was taken, a meeting was suggested on 19 July, but did not take place, and when individuals provided further supporting information, they were not interviewed and it was not investigated.

The tribunal did not find the decision to appoint these two individuals to investigate these grievances to be a sham (nor did it so find in relation to their investigations or reports).

Ms B contends that the tribunal wrongly focussed exclusively on her PTSD, but failed to consider her separate condition of depression and anxiety, or the possibility of the discriminatory treatment having exacerbated her PTSD or its effects; and, again, the tribunal is said to have failed to take account of her own DWP assessment of LCWRA.  The claimants say that the tribunal wrongly penalised them for being ill or disabled, and wrongly treated their intelligence and qualifications as counting against them.  It is also said not to have been clear or consistent as to whether it considered each of them to have been fit to work from the outset of the period from the date when their employment ended to the date of the remedy hearing, or only from some later date.</span></p>

There will always be some element of uncertainty in making such an assessment, as the tribunal is not considering what actually happened, but a counter-factual scenario.

That is because the respondent could not be held liable for losses which the discriminatory treatment had not caused.  Although strictly doctrinally the issue would fall under the label, not of mitigation but of causation, this was therefore a proper, and indeed necessary question for the tribunal to consider.  Taking this approach does not amount to wrongly penalising a claimant for being ill.  The fact that ill health affecting fitness to work is not the claimant&#8217;s own fault does not mean that the respondent must therefore necessarily be liable to compensate them for the loss of remuneration.</span></p>

Mr A was found to be disabled by a mental impairment, to which the judge found it unnecessary to give a specific label (the medical records referred variously to anxiety and depression).

In relation to Ms B the sense of [11.21] and [11.22] is that the impact of the discriminatory treatment which she experienced, on her fitness to work, was considerably more severe and prolonged; and so, had she begun to look for work once she was fit enough to do so, she could then have been expected to find work by the end of an overall period of twelve months.</span></p>

Given the different nature and extent of the discriminatory treatment which each of them had experienced, and the differing medical evidence, it is hardly surprising that the tribunal&#8217;s assessment in relation to Mr A was appreciably more positive than in relation to Ms B.</span></p>

It failed to engage with the limited nature of EJ Blackwell&#8217;s conclusion, the medical evidence of a deterioration in her mental health in the immediate aftermath of the suspension, and the medical evidence supporting the development of anxiety and depression in the relevant period.  The tribunal needed to assess, as best it could, taking account of that evidence, whether the discriminatory treatment of her (or parts of it) had contributed to a deterioration of her mental health from September 2018, to some percentage degree, or whether that treatment exacerbated the effects of the PTSD as a latent pre-existing condition, or whether she was simply peculiarly vulnerable, and tipped over by that cumulative treatment.</span></p>

These phrases have been reused by the tribunal.  The principal points that the tribunal makes about the medical evidence also closely shadow a series of points made by the respondent&#8217;s counsel.  He also postulated the &#8220;solely or mainly attributable&#8221; test of causation, which the tribunal picked up (although he also canvassed a percentage reduction approach, which the tribunal did not follow).</span></p>

Further, while, the impression is created by some passages in the reasoning, that on some aspects the tribunal has adopted the general contention put forward by C Ltd&#8217;s counsel, without any more detailed analysis of its own, the relevant parts of the other substantive grounds of appeal have in any event succeeded.</span></p>

I leave all matters of case management to the tribunal.</span></p>
