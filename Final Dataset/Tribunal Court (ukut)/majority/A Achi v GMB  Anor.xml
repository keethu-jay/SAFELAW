	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">VICTIMISATION; UNFAIR DISMISSAL</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">The claimant was employed as a trade union official.  After transferring to a new region, he encountered difficulties at work.  There were complaints from the branch to which he was assigned.  He received a written warning for a number of instances of lateness.  An application for release for external activities was refused because of insufficient cover.  In March 2017 the claimant began a period of sick leave and thereafter brought a grievance against the Regional Secretary, his line manager and other colleagues, complaining of bullying and race discrimination.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">While the clamant was off sick, and in receipt of sick pay, a leaflet was brought to the Regional Secretary&#8217;s attention referring to him acting as a trainer at events run by an external organisation in May and June.  The Regional Secretary wrote to him asking for an explanation and subsequently initiated an investigation which he delegated to another officer.  The conclusion of that investigation in September was that the claimant had not participated in the events and no further action was taken.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">The claimant&#8217;s grievance was investigated by the Regional Secretary from another region.  He dismissed it in August 2017, and also considered that there should be an investigation pursuant to the union&#8217;s Bullying and Harassment policy, which provides for the making of malicious, vexatious of spurious complaints to be subject to the internal disciplinary procedure.  A senior officer from another region who dismissed his appeal in September 2017 concurred with that view.   A disciplinary hearing was, in the event, put off until the claimant&#8217;s health improved.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">The claimant was entitled to twelve months&#8217; contractual sick pay.  The union erroneously calculated the end date, and as a result it terminated his sick pay about two weeks early, at the end of February 2018.  Following his sick pay having ended, the claimant resigned.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">The employment tribunal dismissed multiple complaints of direct race discrimination, and victimisation.  It also found that there was no breach of the implied duty of trust and confidence, and that, in addition, the claimant had not, as he claimed, decided to resign only in March 2018, because of the premature ending of his sick pay, but had decided in September 2017, following the outcome of his grievance, that he would in due course resign as and when his sick pay entitlement expired.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Grounds of appeal challenging the tribunal&#8217;s decision in respect of certain complaints of victimisation, and the complaint of constructive dismissal, were permitted to proceed to a full hearing.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">The tribunal had not erred by failing to address aspects of the claimant&#8217;s victimisation claims.  It had not been part of the claimant&#8217;s case before the tribunal that he had been victimised by the Regional Secretary wrongly involving himself in the investigation relating to the external training events; nor by that investigation continuing after the response of the event organiser to enquiries, by way of further enquiries of the event host.  Nor did the tribunal err by not finding that the decision to refer the claimant into disciplinary process was not an act of victimisation, having regard to the findings it properly made about the motivations of the officers who considered his grievance and grievance appeal, and the provisions of the union&#8217;s Bullying and Harassment policy to which they referred.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">The tribunal also did not err in concluding that the claimant was not constructively dismissed.  This ground of appeal could not circumvent the finding of fact rejecting the claimed last straw; and it otherwise fell away in view of the dismissal of the appeal in relation to the victimisation complaints.</span></p>

There was a full merits hearing before EJ Gaskell, Mr M Z Khan and Mr R S Virdie, sitting at Birmingham, in October and November 2019.  The claimant was in person.  The respondents were represented by Mr Oliver Segal KC.  In a reserved decision sent in April 2020 the tribunal dismissed complaints of unfair constructive dismissal, and of direct race discrimination and victimisation, but upheld a wages claim in respect of sick pay.</span></p>

His original grounds of appeal were considered not to be arguable by the judge who considered them on paper.  However, at a rule 3(10) hearing at which the claimant was represented by Ms Banton of counsel, amended grounds of appeal were permitted to proceed to a full appeal hearing.  At that hearing before us Ms Banton appeared pro bono again for the claimant, and Mr Segal KC, as in the tribunal, for the respondents.  </span></p>

He began working for GMB Southern region on a temporary contract in September 2014.  From 1 April 2015 he was employed on a permanent contract as an Organisor.  At his request he relocated to the Birmingham region from 16 November 2015.  He was assigned to an industrial team managed by a Senior Organisor, Stuart Richards.  He was allocated to the S20 Security Branch.  The claimant had difficulty establishing a satisfactory working relationship with the branch.  There were complaints from members and representatives.  Mr Richards provided him with two mentors, the Regional Organisers Rebecca Mitchell and Stuart Harrison.</span></p>

In a further review against objectives in June 2016 the claimant was judged to have met 4 out of 5 targets, which was a pass.  In September 2016, having completed two years&#8217; service, the claimant was eligible to be considered for pay progression.  However, Mr Richards assessed that he did not have the necessary skills to meet all aspects of his job description and he was not recommended for pay progression.  The claimant&#8217;s difficulties with S20, as the tribunal put it, came to a head, when the branch passed a motion of no confidence in him in June 2016.  Following this, after discussions, Mr Richards moved him to the organising team, managed by another Senior Organiser, Amanda Gearing, from 1 September 2016.  </span></p>

This coincided with a number of complaints emerging from his time with the industrial team.  Mr Morgan had an informal meeting with the claimant in January 2017, which was mainly focussed on his apparent current unhappiness at work, as Mr Morgan treated the complaints as historical.  The meeting was positive.</span></p>

There were also exchanges in which she refused him leave to attend two events, in one case because two other members were on leave the same day, in the other because he had a full diary that day.  Ms Gearing indicated that she would reconsider if he obtained cover.  On 9 March Mr Morgan heard the claimant&#8217;s appeal against the written warning, which he dismissed.</span></p>

An OH physician conducted a telephone assessment on 6 April and recommended a process of conflict resolution to aid his return.  It was apparent from the report that the claimant felt that he was being treated unfairly, that there was a bullying culture, and that the region did not take diversity issues seriously.  Mr Morgan was concerned to read these allegations, which had not previously been raised.  He wrote to inform the claimant that he had appointed a Senior Organiser, Mohammed Khalik, to conduct an investigation.</span></p>

The tribunal observed that while in it the claimant suggested that the region found it difficult to embrace diversity, it was far from clear that he was alleging race discrimination against these individuals.  As the claimant was now raising a grievance against the Regional Secretary, Mr Khalik&#8217;s investigation was &#8220;stood down&#8221;.  A Regional Secretary from another region, Mr Phillips, was appointed to consider the grievance.  Because of the claimant&#8217;s ill health the grievance hearing was deferred until 3 August 2017.</span></p>

The publicity material suggested that the claimant was one of the tutors at the event. Ms Gearing was concerned that the claimant appeared to be making himself available for such events whilst off sick and ostensibly unfit for work. She forwarded the material to Mr Morgan. Ordinarily Ms Gearing would have dealt with such a matter herself; she did not do so on this occasion because she was aware of the outstanding grievance against her. </span></p>

The claimant did not respond to Mr Morgan; and so, on 23 June 2017, Mr Morgan wrote again - he requested a response by no later than 26 June 2017. When the claimant still did not respond, Mr Morgan took steps to suspend his sick pay with immediate effect and institute a disciplinary investigation.&#8221;</span></p>

On 8 March 2018, the claimant submitted a letter of resignation; he claimed that he was constructively dismissed and that the final straw had been the non-payment of his sick pay on 6 March 2018. As we indicated earlier, we do not believe the claimant on this point; it is quite apparent to us that, well before 6 March 2018, the claimant had decided that he would not be returning to work for the respondent. The claimant remained off sick until his entitlement to sick pay expired; and it was always his intention to resign then. The claimant would not have been entitled to any pay after the 13 March 2018; but, when he resigned on 8 March 2018, he gave one month&#8217;s notice; he was therefore entitled to retain his car until the expiry of the notice period.&#8221;</span></p>

We accept Mr Morgan&#8217;s evidence that the failure to pay was entirely due to an honest misunderstanding of the claimant&#8217;s contract. Further, it is clear from the correspondence we have read that the respondent was willing to engage with the claimant on the point. But, matters were confused by the claimant&#8217;s solicitor repeatedly insisting that sick pay was due until a date in April 2018. </span></p>

We acknowledge that his resignation letter states as much; but we have also considered documentation going back to September 2017 in support of the claimant&#8217;s grievance appeal. In that documentation, the claimant clearly states - &#8220;I cannot work for the GMB anymore, &#8230; I do not have any confidence in working for any movement where things can be put on me and I am unable to defend myself&#8221;. In our judgement, having considered the claimant&#8217;s evidence before us when cross-examined about this, we are quite satisfied that he had already decided to terminate his employment as soon as his entitlement to sick pay ended.</span></p>

Instead, Mr Khalik then pursued further enquiries, seeking copies of the signing in registers from the host University, and the claimant&#8217;s consent to that request.  Only after the University advised in September that the claimant had not signed in, was the investigation ended.

The thrust of the complaints was therefore about the decision to begin the process; but the tribunal accurately recorded that the claimant had accepted during the course of the hearing that a reasonable employer would be concerned to investigate what appeared to be an employee in receipt of sick pay working in another capacity, and would naturally also be concerned if its emails to the employee about that initially went unanswered.</span></p>

While an employment tribunal should make appropriate allowances for a litigant in person, it must decide the complaints and issues that are actually before it; and it cannot descend into the arena to advocate for one party, or to advance a case which the litigant has not himself advanced.  The tribunal also cannot be criticised for not addressing a case that was not advanced before it; and would, conversely, act unfairly if it purported to adjudicate a substantive point against a party in its decision, that had neither been raised nor put to the pertinent witnesses.  The EAT is not a venue in which a party can rerun its arguments about the evidence and the facts; and it is in any case not equipped to engage in such an exercise, because it will only ever have glimpses or selections from the total body of oral and documentary evidence presented to a tribunal during the course of a trial.</span></p>

But if it jumps out to the tribunal or other trained reader, from what they have written or said, what their factual case is about, and what legal category or categories their complaint or complaints fits into, then there is nothing wrong in the tribunal bringing that into focus in a list of issues, expecting the respondent to answer it, and then adjudicating it.

If the point they are trying to make is obvious to the tribunal, there is nothing wrong with the tribunal helping them to articulate it better, and it may be fair to do so.  But the tribunal, while it can make neutral or clarifying enquiries on matters which it needs to understand better in order properly to adjudicate the claims before it, cannot itself proactively cross-examine a witness on areas in which a competent party has chosen not to challenge their clear evidence.  The fact that a professional representative might have approached the task differently than the litigant himself did, is not sufficient warrant to criticise the tribunal for not in effect having performed that role.</span></p>

It is refined and detailed, articulating a series of discrete and focussed complaints about what particular conduct was said to amount to direct race discrimination and what victimisation.  There was no suggestion that it was ever revisited by the claimant, by way of adjustment or addition at the start of the trial, during the course of it, or in final submissions.  Nor was there any suggestion before us that he did not have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses however he wished on the issue.</span></p>

The tribunal did not err by failing to find that, in doing those things, Mr Morgan was retaliating for the claimant having raised a grievance, given its findings that the claimant was in receipt of sick pay on the basis that he was not fit to work, and that, taken at face value, the leaflets informed the reader that he was engaging in training activity for another organisation, and that he did not initially respond to his enquiries.   </span></p>

In any event we cannot see how it could be said to have been perverse for the tribunal not to infer that Mr Khalik had been influenced by Mr Morgan to follow up on the organiser&#8217;s response, by making enquiries from the host University which held signing in sheets, or that Mr Morgan had otherwise wrongly involved himself in the process.</span></p>

It is simply a label that identifies what may in a particular case be a necessary step in the process of determining what as a matter of fact was the real reason for impugned treatment. Once the reasons for particular treatment have been identified by the fact-finding tribunal, it must evaluate whether the reasons so identified are separate from the protected disclosure, or whether they are so closely connected with it that a distinction cannot fairly and sensibly be drawn. Were this exercise not permissible, the effect would be that whistle-blowers would have immunity for behaviour or conduct related to the making of a protected disclosure no matter how bad, and employers would be obliged to ensure that they are not adversely treated, again no matter how bad the associated behaviour or conduct.&#8221;</span></p>

There is no objective standard against which behaviour must be assessed to determine whether the separability principle applies in a particular case, nor any question of requiring behaviour to reach a particular threshold of seriousness before that behaviour or conduct can be distinguished as separable from the making of the protected disclosure itself. The phrases used in the authorities (in the context of trade union activities, victimisation and whistleblowing) capture the flavour of the distinction, but were not intended to be treated as defining, and do not define, those cases where separability would or would not apply. They cannot properly be read in this way. In the wide spectrum of human conduct that might be relied on by decision-makers, each end of the spectrum is easy to identify as Phillips J observed in&#160;</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">Lyon</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">: gross misconduct or conduct that is "wholly unreasonable, extraneous or malicious" at one end; and wholly innocent, blameless conduct at the other.

It failed to consider why the mistake was made, or why sick pay was not continued pending resolution of the disagreement about when it ended.

He did not decided to do so in March, over the issue of whether it had been cut short prematurely.  That finding of fact cannot be reopened.  In any event the tribunal made a finding that it was plainly entitled to, on the evidence before it, that GMB stopped the claimant&#8217;s sick pay on the date that it genuinely believed was the date when his entitlement ended, even though its belief &#8211; and the differing belief of his adviser &#8211; as to the correct date, both turned out to be incorrect.  In light of that evidence, we do not think the tribunal would have been bound to conclude that this did amount in law to a last straw, even if it had found as a fact that the claimant had relied upon it.</span></p>

That is why point (1) of this ground is (as Eady J noted when granting permission for it to proceed) parasitic on the earlier grounds of challenge in relation to the outcome of the victimisation complaints.  Given that the challenge in respect of those complaints has failed, this challenge must also, therefore, for that reason alone, fail.  </span></p>

But we note that these were points which, he argued, meant that a partial victory in the challenge to the victimisation decisions might not be sufficient to disturb the outcome in respect of constructive dismissal and/or that, at best for the claimant, the matter would have had to be remitted to the tribunal to give consider the issue of affirmation.</span></p>
