	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE &#8211; time for appealing</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Th claimant in the employment tribunal appealed to the EAT judge against the order of the Registrar of the EAT refusing to extend time for instituting her appeal from the employment tribunal.  The tribunal had dismissed her claims following a full merits hearing.  She had applied for a reconsideration, but, upon preliminary consideration, that was refused by the judge.  She sought to appeal the reconsideration decision.  Her notice of appeal and attachments were submitted within the time limit, but the attachments did not include the detailed grounds of claim document that had been attached to, and incorporated in, the claim form.  That document was sent to the EAT after the time limit for appealing had expired.  The appeal was therefore properly instituted out of time.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The reason why the grounds of claim document had not originally been sent to the EAT within the time limit for appealing was that the claimant mistakenly assumed, without checking, that it formed part of the ET1 document that she had sent to the EAT.  This was an error which did not amount to a good reason for extending time.  It was not the responsibility of the EAT&#8217;s administration to identify the omission and bring it to the claimant&#8217;s attention within the time limit.  It was the responsibility of the claimant to take the necessary care to ensure that her appeal was properly instituted in time.  Notwithstanding her strength of feeling about her alleged treatment by the respondent, the conduct of the employment tribunal, and of the litigation, and what she maintained was the severe injustice done to her by the tribunal&#8217;s original decision, there were no exceptional circumstances to justify an extension of time.  The claimant&#8217;s appeal against the Registrar&#8217;s order was accordingly dismissed.</span></p>

The claimant&#8217;s case was that the termination of her employment had been engineered by Professor Westley, with whom she had previously for a time had a personal relationship.

The claimant represented herself.  The respondent was represented by Mr Gill of counsel.  The tribunal gave an oral decision in which it dismissed all of the claimant&#8217;s complaints.  The tribunal&#8217;s written judgment and reasons were sent to the parties on 1 December 2020.  In very brief summary, it made detailed findings of fact about the course of both the working and personal relationships between the claimant and Professor Westley.  It found that they had had what was described as a dating relationship for a time in 2015.  In light of its findings of fact, however, it dismissed all of the section 26 complaints.  It upheld the respondent&#8217;s case as to the reason why the claimant&#8217;s contract was not renewed, and found that that decision was not in any way influenced by Professor Westley.  It found the dismissal to be otherwise fair.</span></p>

I explained to her that, for obvious reasons, I could not advise her, or assist her to present her case as such.  However, I explained how the hearing would be conducted and I indicated that, should she be unclear or concerned about any practical or procedural matter she should raise it with me.  I also explained to her that it was not only proper, but also fair, for the respondent&#8217;s solicitors to have provided her with copies of the legal authorities to which their counsel intended to refer.  </span></p>

There is no automatic right to an extension of time.  The EAT, as an appellate court, takes a strict approach to applications for extension of time, taking account of the fact that the matter will already have been the subject of a first instance decision, and the interest of finality in litigation.  The time limit for appealing of 42 days is a generous one.  It is the responsibility of the party seeking to appeal to ensure that the notice of appeal, together with all required documents, are duly presented within that time limit.  It is not the duty of the EAT or its staff, either before or after the time limit expires, to alert a party to defects in compliance, or to do so within a particular time scale.

Error, oversight, or carelessness are not ordinarily acceptable excuses.  Nor are ignorance of the time limit or what documents are required to properly institute an appeal.  These matters are clearly explained in materials to which parties are signposted when judgments are sent out, and which are readily available on the internet.  The length of the delay may be relevant, but a delay of hours, minutes or even seconds may be fatal.  The fact that the other party may not be prejudiced by a very short delay is not a sufficient reason by itself to extend time.  The potential merits of the proposed grounds of appeal will not usually be relevant, although they can be, for example where they are patently very weak.  In some cases there may be some other compelling exceptional reason to extend time, despite the lack of an acceptable excuse, but such cases are rare and exceptional.</span></p>

I have already set out what the claimant wrote in her initial correspondence with the EAT after the absence of the grounds of claim document was raised with her, and then in her application for an extension of time, about why the document was not provided in time, and why time should be extended.  She developed her arguments in her written skeleton for this hearing and in oral submissions at the hearing.  </span></p>

In any event, as I have noted, ignorance of these things is not ordinarily an acceptable excuse.  The &#8220;Judgment&#8221; booklet, the EAT&#8217;s rules and practice direction, and other materials readily available on the internet and elsewhere, all make clear what is required and by when, in language accessible to lay people.  They highlight the importance of observing the strict time limits.  The 42-day time limit allows ample time for a notice of appeal to be prepared and the required documents to be assembled, including by a litigant in person.   </span></p>

The reason why the grounds of claim document was not sent to the EAT, either within the unopenable attachment to the email of 9 February 2021, or among the attachments to her email of 16 February 2021, was because the claimant made a mistake.  As she stated in her email of 17 February 2021: &#8220;I thought the grounds were included in the ET1.&#8221;  As she observed in paragraph 1 of her submission emailed to the EAT on 27 April 2021, that was &#8220;a genuine error on my part&#8221;.  She said the same thing again, in so many words, during the course of the hearing of the appeal before me.  I accept that factual explanation.</span></p>

She knew that this was one of the documents that she needed to send to the EAT in order for her appeal to be properly instituted, as well as the ET1 form.  However, she failed to send it with either of those emails, because she assumed that it was included within the attachment labelled ET1 that formed part of the compressed single file attached to her email of 9 February, and which was one of the documents attached to her email of 16 February 2021.  But she plainly made that assumption without checking.  That is also plainly why she offered no explanation to the EAT for the omission of that document, in the emails of 9 or 16 February 2021.  At that point, on account of her error, and her failure to check the position, she did not realise that anything was missing.</span></p>

This would have been straightforward to do.  Further, and in any event, it is clear that she did have a copy of the separate grounds of claim document, or at any rate she had immediate access to it.  Once the omission was drawn to her attention she swiftly provided a copy to the EAT without any difficulty.  It has never been her case that she had some difficulty in obtaining or accessing the document, as such.</span></p>

When she was told that the compressed attachment could not be opened, she promptly provided separate attachments.  When she was told that the grounds of claim document was missing she promptly provided that too.  She had not deliberately failed to provide what was required within the requisite time limit.  There would be no reason for her to do that.  I accept all of that; but it is well-established by the authorities that guide me, that an error of this sort, and the fact that the error was not intentional, are not sufficient excuse to justify an extension of time.</span></p>

She says that she found preparing the appeal to be overwhelming and refers to the devastating impact which she says that the employment tribunal&#8217;s original and reconsideration decisions had upon her mentally.  I accept that the tribunal&#8217;s initial and reconsideration decisions will have been experienced by her as severe blows.  But she was able to take a number of steps in the weeks following those decisions, including complaining about the judge, applying for a reconsideration, corresponding with the REJ, preparing her notice of appeal against the reconsideration, which sets out her grounds of appeal and arguments at some length, taking cognisance of the deadline and required documents, and locating and compiling such attachments as she did send.  There is no evidence, medical or otherwise, presented to me, that would support the conclusion that this error was materially affected by mental ill health so severe or prolonged as to impair the claimant&#8217;s capability to take the care and the steps required to ensure that her notice of appeal, together with all required documents, was submitted in time.</span></p>

She also complains that, following her email of 9 February, the EAT did not email her until, as she put it, the last minute, and that, after she responded on 16 February, the EAT took a further day to alert her to the fact that the document was not attached to that email.

In any event, when the difficulty with the original attachment was pointed out to her, she still, through error, failed to provide the grounds of claim document as a separate attachment.  As I have noted, it is not the responsibility of the EAT&#8217;s administration to point out errors, or to do so within any particular timescale, whether before or after the time limit has expired.  I also hope that on reflection the claimant will recognise that there is no basis for her allegation of deliberate conduct to sabotage her appeal.</span></p>

She also contrasts this delay with the length of time it has taken the EAT to progress the matter through its subsequent stages thus far.  However, time limits for appealing are important for the particular reasons I have explained; and a litigant who does not take the necessary care to check that they have complied with the requirements to institute an appeal on time must bear the risk that, by the time the problem is identified, it may be too late to correct it.  Further, as the authorities make clear, the fact that the delay was in this case short is not a sufficient reason to extend time.  The granting of an extension of time would mean that the respondent may be deprived of the certainty and finality of the outcome of the employment tribunal&#8217;s decision that the claimant seeks to challenge.</span></p>

This, she has written, was sabotage in the hope that she would not submit the appeal in time.  However, the only such correspondence in my bundle is the REJ&#8217;s letter of 8 January 2021.  That was written after EJ Quill&#8217;s decision on the reconsideration application had been sent.  It does not say that EJ Quill will be further reconsidering his decision.  It does not tell the claimant to wait for something more.  That letter was also written very shortly after the reconsideration decision was sent, and there was still ample time for the claimant to prepare her notice of appeal against it, assemble all of the required documents, and submit her appeal in time.</span></p>
