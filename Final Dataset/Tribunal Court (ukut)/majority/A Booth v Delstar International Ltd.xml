	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">In an appeal and cross-appeal, the claimant and Delstar agreed that the ET&#8217;s two separate conclusions on claims of discrimination arising from the claimant&#8217;s disability, one allowing a claim, the other dismissing a claim, were based on the same legal principles and so could not both be correct.   Delstar also argued that the ET had erred in allowing an indirect discrimination claim.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Held:  </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">allowing the appeal and cross-appeal</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">While there is no reason in principle that an ET cannot properly reach different conclusions on different allegations, in this case, the facts did not allow for a different conclusion.   The unfavourable treatment was different, but both were found to have occurred.  The ET had erred in failing to apply the guidance of Simler P, as she then was, in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Pnaiser v NHS England</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2016] IRLR 170" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2016">[2016] IRLR 170</ref>, paragraph 31. The ET had allowed the claim that a delay in applying for income protection benefit was &#8216;due to&#8217; the initial erroneous belief of Delstar&#8217;s manager that those employees who were permanently disabled and who were not expected to return to work could not benefit from the insurance.  In contrast, the ET had dismissed the claim that the same manager had initially attempted to dismiss the claimant, which the ET accepted was unfavourable treatment, because it was not something arising in consequence of the claimant&#8217;s disability, but the manager&#8217;s erroneous belief.   The ET erred in two respects.   First, it failed to consider multiple causes.   Second, it had misstated the &#8216;something arising.&#8217;   The claimant had claimed the same &#8216;something&#8217; for both claims: absence due to long-term sickness.  In contrast, the ET had considered the &#8216;something&#8217; in the &#8216;delay&#8217; claim as being long-term sickness absence and permanent incapacity, but only long-term sickness absence in the second &#8216;dismissal&#8217; claim.  That error had affected the ET&#8217;s analysis of both stages of causation, as the manager&#8217;s erroneous belief had been the same in both claims.  It was not obvious as to which claim should succeed, which required a further assessment of the manager&#8217;s thought processes.   The ET needed to consider both claims afresh, by reference to the same &#8216;something.&#8217;</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">In relation to the cross-appeal, the ET also erred in comparing &#8220;disabled people&#8221; with &#8220;non-disabled people,&#8221; for the purposes of the indirect disability discrimination claim.  In doing so, it had failed to consider whether the provision, criterion or practice applied by Delstar would put those who shared the same disability as the claimant at a particular disadvantage when compared with those who did not share that disability.   While statistical evidence might not, in all cases, be necessary, the ET needed at least to consider how those sharing the claimant&#8217;s disability would be impacted, instead of assuming a group disadvantage.  </span></p>

During this period, Delstar sought advice from its occupational health (&#8216;OH&#8217;) advisors, and eventually Unum, about the likelihood of the claimant&#8217;s return to work, for the purposes of considering the claimant&#8217;s continuing employment and his entitlement to income protection, after his company sick pay ran out.    Initially, the claimant&#8217;s prognosis was unclear.   However, the OH advisors advised in a report written sometime in December 2017 that the claimant was unfit for work, and was not likely to be fit in the foreseeable future.   </span></p>

This was said to be because of how one of Delstar&#8217;s HR managers, a Ms Davis, viewed the claimant&#8217;s entitlement to benefit from the Unum policy.   She erroneously believed that the claimant could not benefit from the Unum policy, as she believed that only those employees who were likely to recover could benefit, whilst those employees who were assessed as permanently unfit for work could not.   She held that belief without having checked the policy, or asking Unum for clarification.    As a result, she began conversations with the claimant about his dismissal or ill-health retirement, with an ex gratia payment, and she delayed applying on his behalf to Unum for income protection, which was available after 26 weeks&#8217; absence.   The focus of the dismissal claim is a meeting which began on 30 January 2018 and recommenced on 5 February 2018, at which she discussed with the claimant the possibility of his dismissal.    Delstar informed the claimant of Ms Davis&#8217;s error, in or around late April/ early May 2018.   Delstar then successfully applied for income protection, and the claimant received back-dated benefits on 14 September 2018.</span></p>

The gist is as follows.   In relation to the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/27/section/15" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 15</ref> delay claim, Delstar accepts that the ET was entitled to conclude that the delay was unfavourable treatment, but says that the ET was wrong to attribute the cause of that delay to the &#8216;something arising,&#8217; namely the appellant&#8217;s long term absence (see question b, after paragraph 119 of the ET&#8217;s Judgment).   The ET had identified at paragraph 121 that the delay was due to Mr Davis&#8217;s belief, but failed to consider, in reaching its conclusion at paragraph 122, whether the reason for the delay was caused by the &#8216;something arising&#8217;. Instead, Delstar argued that the operative cause was Mrs Davis&#8217;s mistaken belief, rather than the background facts of the claimant&#8217;s disability and absence. </span></p>

Her motive was irrelevant, but her reasons were not. These were because of the &#8216;something&#8217; that the claimant was on long-term sickness absence and was permanently incapacitated.  She must have believed the Unum policy capable of applying to some employees, and the only possible group were those on long-term absence but expected to return, e.g. someone with a badly broken leg.  The facts, as found by the ET, were that the manager had initially intended to apply for income protection but had changed her mind when she was advised that the claimant was permanently incapacitated.  The manager had drawn the distinction between those employees who were permanently disabled and those who were absent but would return.  That was why she had threatened to dismiss the claimant, when previously, when the prognosis had been unclear, she had not, and had intended to make the insurance application.   The change was the prognosis of permanent incapacity.

The claimant was now arguing a case that he had not claimed.   He had not claimed that the &#8216;something arising&#8217; was permanent incapacity, but had relied on long-term sickness absence.  The manager had been supportive of the claimant when he was on long-term sickness absence, and had not threatened him with dismissal, or considered the same, because of that absence, but because of her inexperience and unfamiliarity with the Unum policy terms.  In contrast, the claimant&#8217;s long-term sickness absence was one of a number of links in the cause of the delay in applying for income protection insurance, and the ET&#8217;s reasons on the delay claim were either inadequate or perverse.   </span></p>

The fallacy in Delstar&#8217;s argument could be seen by rephrasing the PCP, so that instead of not applying for income protection for employees who were permanently incapacitated, it was phrased as only applying for income protection for employees who are likely to be able to return to work.  The second formulation had precisely the same substance and meaning and it was easy to see why it put the disabled group at a particular disadvantage and put the claimant at that disadvantage.  On Delstar's own case, there was a group capable of benefitting from Unum, namely those employees who were on long-term sickness but not permanently incapacitated and it was for them that the manager had believed the Unum policy was in place.  The general pool had been created by the manager&#8217;s mistaken belief, which put those who were disabled at a group disadvantage, and in turn the claimant to individual disadvantage.  An example was of a person who had a particularly serious bone fracture, who was absent for long enough to benefit from income protection, (26 weeks), but less than 12 months.   Ms Mellor had relied on section 6(3) </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">EqA</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">, namely those sharing the claimant&#8217;s characteristic needed to share the same disability, but all section 6(3) was intended to do was ensure that there was a comparison of like with like, within the disadvantaged group, in contrast with those who were not in the disadvantaged group.  There was no need for statistical evidence of comparative disadvantage because of the nature of the factual case.  </span></p>

There is a requirement of a PCP of potentially general application, not just to those sharing a claimant&#8217;s disability.  The group of people, of which the claimant is a member, must have the same disability as the claimant.   There needs to a comparison between that group and those who do not share that disability.  The comparator group may include those without any disabilities, and those with disabilities which are not the same as the claimant&#8217;s.   The comparison is not between people with disabilities and those without, which is a different requirement under the section 20 duty to make adjustments (where a PCP puts a disabled person at a substantial disadvantage in relation to a relevant matter in comparison with persons who are not disabled).  Both the claimant&#8217;s group and the comparator group may be hypothetical, because of the word, &#8220;would&#8221;, in subsections 2(a) and (b) of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/19" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 19</ref>.  However, that does not avoid the need to analyse whether those in the claimant&#8217;s group would be put to a particular disadvantage (without falling into the trap of asking &#8220;why&#8221;, as it is often difficult to identify complex causes).   While statistical evidence may not be available, the impact on one person, with the same disability, may not necessarily be the same as the impact on another.   For example, it may be, depending on the evidence, that a proportion of those who share the claimant&#8217;s disability, a pulmonary embolism and kidney disease, would have still been viewed as likely to return to work, during the time period when the PCP was applied.   While it is not a requirement that the PCP puts every member of the claimant&#8217;s group at a particular disadvantage, the ET had not asked that question, or gone on to consider whether those with the same disability would be viewed as more unlikely ever to return to work, when compared with those with different disabilities or no disabilities at all.   That, ultimately, was the flaw in Mr Croxford&#8217;s reformulated PCP.  It assumed that people with disabilities were more likely to be put to particular disadvantage than those without disabilities, without making a comparison between the two appropriate groups.   As a consequence, the ET erred in its assessment of group disadvantage.   It is no answer to point to a person who is not disabled, who had an absence lasting or likely to last more than 26 weeks (the deferral period under the Unum scheme) but less than twelve months, who would not be put to a particular disadvantage.   While that person would be one member of the comparator group, it ignored other group members, including those with different disabilities, in comparison to those sharing the claimant&#8217;s disability.   Contrary to Mr Croxford&#8217;s submissions, the ET&#8217;s analysis was not consistent with </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Ryan</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">, because of the flaw in the ET&#8217;s analysis of group disadvantage.    The ET will therefore need to revisit this analysis when assessing the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/19" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 19</ref> </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">EqA </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">claim.  I therefore also allow this part of Delstar&#8217;s cross-appeal against the ET&#8217;s decision on the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/19" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 19</ref> claim.   </span></p>
