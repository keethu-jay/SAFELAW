The applicant had admitted to the embezzlement of substantial funds from a company of which he was the Chief Executive Officer: [11] and [62].  It was this conduct which led the respondent to conclude that the applicant should be excluded from the Convention on the basis that he had committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission thereto.  The AIT rejected Professor Goodwin-Gill&#8217;s evidence that the applicant&#8217;s crimes were neither &#8216;serious&#8217; nor &#8216;non-political&#8217; for the purposes of Article 1F(b), as that provision is applied internationally: [64] and [74].

		<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">[99] The years since 2009 have seen a significant retrenchment of the regime in Russia and a marked slide towards a more authoritarian and repressive state.  The power of the FSB, the PGO and the law enforcement agencies has increased in order to narrow the space for dissent and civic unrest.  As noted above, the authorities were deeply concerned by the protests of 2001 and 2012.  They dealt with these robustly by jailing demonstrators and signalling to academics, artists, human rights activities and opposition politicians that they must take care not to step out of line.  Business has long since been cowed and has felt the changes less than other sections of society.</span></p>

The re-election of Putin in 2018 has secured its existence for now but it is clearly battening down the hatches in readiness for possible instability.  Its nightmare scenario is a Ukraine-style revolution that it believes was a US special operation.  Moves to reduce economic dependence on the West and insulate Russians from the global internet are part of the same picture.  Structural reforms are off the agenda.  Fortress Russia is taking shape.  In this context, it is impossible at present to see any possibility of broader political reform that is a pre-requisite for an overhaul of the criminal justice system and the courts.    </span></p>

The report has been considered in line with your current situation.  In his report Mr Lough mentions that if you returned to Russia you would not receive a fair trial (paragraph 90 of report).  It is accepted that at this current time you cannot immediately be removed to Russia as this would breach your rights under the European Convention on Human Rights and you are therefore subject to the Restricted Leave policy.  The report also mentions (paragraph 101) that your exclusion from the refugee convention under Article 1F(b) does not take into account you were working at Mezhregiongaz and that you were part of a system that operated on the basis of unwritten &#8216;understandings&#8217;, not law.  However, as already outlined in this letter you are reminded that whilst working at Mezhregiongaz you diverted company funds and admitted to personally benefitting from the scheme by US$6 million.  No charges were brought against you.  In 2007 and 2011 the Russian Federation submitted requests for your extradition, based on two charges of &#8216;abuse of official position&#8217;.  The first request was stayed for legal reasons (abuse of process), the second was refused as you were granted protection-based leave.  Mr Lough drafted his report whilst in possession of various documents and based his findings on his opinion and these documents.  However, the Upper Tribunal upheld the determination of the Asylum and Immigration in that you committed a serious non-political crime and as such you are excluded from the protection afforded by the Refugee Convention under Article 1F of that Convention in accordance with paragraph 334 of the Immigration Rules.  There is nothing contained in the report that changes this as your case had been considered and upheld by the courts.  </span></p>

The applicant had been discharged from extradition by Senior District Judge Workman, who had concluded that the proceedings were brought on an improper ground.

Mr Lough had been clear about the prospect of there being any material change in Russia.  It was accepted that there was a public interest in restricting the applicant&#8217;s leave but the letter did little more than &#8216;parrot&#8217; the policy; it failed to engage in any meaningful way with the reality of the applicant&#8217;s situation.  </span></p>

Only two individuals had ever been extradited to Russia and the decisions in their cases appeared in the authorities bundle.  This was important because the situation in Russia was such that extradition was usually refused on Article 3 or 6 ECHR grounds.  It was notable that the Russian authorities had lied to the UK authorities in one such case, seemingly in an effort to procure the extradition of a suspect.</span></p>

Issues of high policy were at stake &#8211; including the international relations of the United Kingdom &#8211; and the court should be slow to interfere with a decision taken in such a context.  There were no human rights at issue, whether by reference to the applicant&#8217;s family in the UK or by reference to the curtailment of his liberty by the conditions imposed by the respondent.   All of the objectives which the RL policy sought to achieve were to the fore in a case such as this.

Article 1F was very different from Article 33 of the Refugee Convention; the former applied to those who had done something so egregious that it would be unconscionable for them to receive protection.

The objectives include the public interest in maintaining the integrity of immigration control through the conferral of short periods of leave, accompanied by regular reporting conditions.&#160; The policy seeks to enable frequent review by the respondent of those subject to the policy with a view to facilitating their removal, should circumstances change such that the previous barriers to removal no longer apply. This ensures &#8220;close contact&#8221; is maintained with the individual concerned, and also gives a &#8220;clear signal&#8221; that the person concerned should not become &#8220;established&#8221; in this country.&#160; The repeated grants of only short periods of leave emphasise the intended impermanence of the residence of a person subject to the RL policy.&#160; The policy is intended to make it more difficult for such persons to put down roots here, or build up private or family life which, if established, may later present difficulties for the removal of the individual, if and when conditions in the destination country change such that removal becomes feasible. </span></p>

Thus, at page 32, the RL policy notes that there is no period of time which is likely automatically to be regarded as too long as being subject to the RL policy, although it notes that all such applications must be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Mr Keith does not submit &#8211; as Ms Anderson sought to suggest &#8211; that the applicant should be granted ILR if he cannot be removed.

The respondent&#8217;s version of events, as set out at [37] of the decision under challenge, is that the first extradition request was refused on grounds of abuse of process and the second was refused because the applicant was granted &#8216;protection-based leave&#8217;.  At [193] of the applicant&#8217;s statement of 25 May 2019, however, he states that the extradition proceedings &#8216;were heard before SDJ Workman who refused the application, twice, on the basis of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/41/section/81" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 81</ref> of the <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/41" uk:canonical="2003 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Extradition Act 2003</ref>, namely that the extradition proceedings were politically motivated&#8217;.  The same point was made in the submissions in support of a previous application for ILR which appear at p156 of the applicant&#8217;s bundle.  There is simply no consensus between the parties that the basis upon which the applicant was discharged was the basis contained in <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/41/section/81" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">s81</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2003/41" uk:canonical="2003 c. 41" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2003 Act</ref>.  In truth, as I suggested to Mr Keith during his submissions, what I am invited to do is to assume that the discharge was on the basis claimed by the applicant.  I see no reason to do so.

The process of extradition is initiated when an extradition request is made to the Secretary of State, who must then decide whether to issue a certificate, having regard to the matters in s70.  A judge then decides under s71 whether to issue a warrant for the arrest of the relevant person.  The individual is arrested and brought before the court, at which point a date is set for the extradition hearing.  At that hearing, the judge must be satisfied that the conduct in question amounts to an extradition offence; that none of the bars to extradition apply; that (in accusation cases) there is </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">prima facie</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> evidence of guilt; and that extradition would not breach the individual&#8217;s human rights.

That case concerned two Polish individuals of Roma ethnicity who had been granted refugee status and ILR in the United Kingdom.

Keene LJ noted that refugee status could be ceased or revoked and analysed the safeguards provided to the refugee by the Convention itself and the Qualification Directive.  At [24], he noted that the process by which refugee status might be brought to an end &#8216;is a necessarily elaborate one&#8217; upon which a District Judge in extradition proceedings should not pronounce; such matters should instead be left to the Secretary of State and the AIT, then the specialist appellate body charged with considering appeals against cessation decisions.  It was indeed common ground before the Divisional Court that the District Judge should not have assessed whether or not there was a continuing entitlement to refugee status: [25].  So long as the status persisted, and in the absence of any suggestion that cessation was under consideration, the only proper course was to discharge Dytlow from extradition on the basis of abuse of process: [30].</span></p>

This applicant holds no comparable underlying status.  He was excluded from the protection of the Refugee Convention and the decision of the Magistrates&#8217; Court conferred no ongoing status, whether in domestic or international law.

Where the human rights issues have been resolved in the extradition proceedings, or where no bars were raised, it is difficult to see on what basis those issues should be reconsidered, let alone determined differently, in FtT or UTIAC proceedings, or why, if the human rights basis for an asylum claim has been disposed of in extradition proceedings, the empty husk of an asylum claim should not be disposed of rapidly by the Tribunal. After all, the former must operate to a fast timetable, the extradition order must be given effect, and the requesting judicial authority is not in a position to respond to the asylum claim allegations. At the very least, the Magistrates' Court decision on a human rights claim, and even more so the decision of the High Court on appeal, must be a very powerful consideration for the Tribunal, as must be the fact that an available extradition bar, relevant to an asylum claim, has not been raised or pursued in extradition proceedings.</span></p>

The respondent must have regard to the fact that the individual was discharged from extradition but the weight to be attached to the extradition decision is not a fixity.  Where the decision in the extradition proceedings is recent, reasoned and based on the same evidence as is before the respondent, it might be difficult for her (or an appellate body) to take a different view.  But the extradition decision confers no lasting status.  Where circumstances have changed, or more evidence has become available, or even perhaps where the extradition decision is scantly reasoned, the respondent might justifiably take a different view from the extradition court when considering a human rights claim or deciding whether to remove an applicant.

In particular, I see no proper basis for the submission that the respondent was somehow required to chart a course through the reported authorities with a view to placing the applicant&#8217;s conduct somewhere on a notional scale of seriousness.

In submitting that it was not, Ms Anderson made detailed reference to the respondent&#8217;s policy.  She highlighted, in particular, the objectives of the policy in creating obstacles to the settlement of those, like the applicant, who are &#8216;not welcome&#8217; in the UK as a result of their conduct but cannot be removed due to the ECHR.  She also noted the importance of the respondent being able to impose conditions, which would no longer be available upon ILR being granted.  The submission, in essence, was that the respondent could not rationally have concluded that there was a proper case for an exceptional grant of ILR on these facts, even if she had not erred in concluding as she did at [18] of the decision under challenge.</span></p>

The cost of such an application (consisting of the application fee and legal fees) is significant.  I have concluded that the basis upon which the respondent decided that he should again be granted RL was unlawful.  The effect of an order quashing the decision to grant limited leave is that the application for ILR remains outstanding before the respondent and must be considered lawfully.  A quashing order therefore serves a useful purpose, and to fail to make one would be to require the applicant to incur the further cost of making a further application for ILR despite the fact that he did not receive a lawful decision on the application he made in April 2019.</span></p>
