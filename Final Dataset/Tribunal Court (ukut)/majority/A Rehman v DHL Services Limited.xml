	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">At a preliminary hearing an employment judge determined that the claimant was not a disabled person with respect to any of three impairments. He concluded that the independent medical evidence was insufficient to support the claimant&#8217;s case, and that the claimant&#8217;s own evidence could not be relied upon. He drew, in reaching his conclusions, on his interpretation of a phrase in one of the medical reports before him, as signifying that the claimant had deliberately exaggerated the account which he had given to that expert. That was an erroneous reading of that phrase in that report, and it undermined the judge&#8217;s reasoning in relation to all three impairments. Although the judge had accepted, in a reconsideration decision, that he had misinterpreted that phrase, the reasoning in the reconsideration decision was not sufficient to repair the fundamental error in the original decision.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The claimant&#8217;s appeal on the disability issue was therefore allowed and the matter was remitted for rehearing.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">A further ground of appeal against the judge&#8217;s decision to refuse an amendment application failed. The judge&#8217;s reasoning in that regard remained sound, notwithstanding the error in his decision as to whether the claimant was, by reference to mental ill health, a disabled person.</span></p>

In July 2019 he applied for a permanent position, but failed the written test.  His engagement then came to an end on 27 August 2019. He presented tribunal claims in August 2019 complaining of disability discrimination, in particular, discrimination arising from disability and victimisation. He also asked the respondent to permit him to retake the written test with certain adjustments being made. Whilst it did not accept that it had failed in any duty to the claimant, the respondent permitted him to do this.  The claimant again took the test in October 2019 but, although his score was higher than before, he again was failed on the basis of his score.</span></p>

As the tribunal&#8217;s decision explains, the claimant injured his jaw in an accident in 2014. A plate, with screws, was inserted.  These were removed in June 2018.  In September 2018 he was involved in a road traffic accident, which he said had an impact on his mental health. He had also had bilateral keratoconus for more than 10 years and he told the tribunal that this was a lifelong condition.</span></p>

The judge went on in any event to consider the application to amend, which he refused. Accordingly, only the complaint of victimisation (which does not depend on the claimant being disabled) survived.</span></p>

At this stage I note the following.  The judge identified that he had to decide whether the claimant was a disabled person in the period December 2018 to August 2019. The key issue, in relation to each impairment, was whether, during that period, it had a substantial and long-term adverse effect on the claimant&#8217;s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities (</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref></span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> section 6(1)(b)), taking account, in relation to keratoconus, of the provision in schedule 1 paragraph 5 to the effect that, in the case of a visual impairment, a relevant consideration is the extent to which the impairment is correctable by the use of spectacles or contact lenses. The judge concluded that the evidence did not, in respect of any impairment, establish such a substantial adverse effect in the relevant period. </span></p>

The claimant contended that he had not included them in his original claim forms because of his mental ill health; but, for reasons he explained, the judge did not accept that.  Having considered all the relevant factors, the judge concluded that the balance of prejudice weighed against permitting the amendment.</span></p>

That was refused on paper in January 2021. The judge identified two errors in para [50] of his original decision, concerning the report of a consultant psychiatrist, Dr Whittington, but went on to state that these had no bearing on the core conclusion.</span></p>

The medical evidence that had been placed before the judge at the PH to determine disabled status had included a report of Dr Kavita Misra, a chartered clinical psychologist, dated 2 May 2020, arising from a video interview with the claimant in April. That report had been prepared for the purposes of a personal injury claim arising from the 2018 road traffic accident.  In his decision on the question of disabled status the judge had made a number of references to Dr Misra&#8217;s report.</span></p>

The claimant contended that this letter showed that the judge had erred in his understanding of what Dr Misra had meant by that expression.  In a decision sent in March 2021 that application was also refused. The judge considered that, even accepting what Dr Misra had said in that letter, about her use of that expression, having regard to the remainder of the judge&#8217;s reasoning, the original decision and outcome were not affected.</span></p>

HHJ Tayler permitted two grounds to proceed, which he described in his reasons. In respect of the decision on disabled status the single ground was that the judge erred in treating Dr Misra&#8217;s reference to &#8220;unconscious magnification of symptoms&#8221; as &#8220;evidence that the claimant was deliberately exaggerating his symptoms, whereas it should have been treated as a possible component of his impairment.&#8221; </span></p>

She had not seen GP records, but, taking account of the claimant&#8217;s self-report, she considered that the accident had exacerbated a pre-existing low mood and anxiety disorder. Following the accident he had also reported neck and shoulder pain, whiplash injuries and headaches.</span></p>

No issue is taken with the summary of the law, as such. The judge then summarised the evidence, being two impact statements on which the claimant was cross-examined, and a number of medical reports and letters, which he listed, noting that some appeared to have been prepared for the purposes of the personal injury claim.</span></p>

At paragraphs [21] to [29] he reviewed the evidence on such matters as whether the claimant had difficulty with wearing a contact lens in his right eye, how long he was able to keep the lens or lenses in for, activities from which he said he abstained, or which he said he found difficult, because of his eye condition, whether he had difficulties with his vision at night, or reading without a magnifier in addition to the lens(es), and what the impact was or was not, on his ability to use public transport, or drive, whether by day or night.  The judge noted various differences in what the claimant had said on different occasions about some of these matters.  He also noted that there was no medical evidence to the effect that the claimant had been advised to refrain from various activities mentioned, as opposed to these being things that he had himself chosen to avoid or not do.</span></p>

Once again, he reviewed the evidence from the claimant and the clinical evidence, on various topics, focussing on the period following the removal of the plate and screws in 2018. These included whether the claimant had difficulty eating, experienced numbness in the face, was affected in his speech, and, in particular the issue of ongoing pain. As to that the judge contrasted the post-operative assessment of the oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Mr Speculand, that the ongoing potential for pain was minor or trivial, with the account of persisting chronic pain that the claimant had given to other clinicians. A reduced ability to open his mouth was attributed by Mr Speculand to poor dental hygiene, that could be addressed by various steps which, the respondent submitted, the claimant could reasonably be expected to take.</span></p>

This included noting that the claimant was referred to Birmingham Healthy Minds at latest by April 2019, that an independent consultant psychiatrist, Dr Middleton, had assessed him in February 2020 as having Mixed Anxiety and Depressive Disorder, and that Dr Misra had assessed him (on interview in April 2020) as being clinically depressed and recommended a course of CBT and/or EDMR.  The respondent submitted that the implication of Dr Middleton&#8217;s report was that the symptoms specifically arising from the 2018 accident had run their course by the end of 2019, and that there was a lack of clear evidence of substantial adverse effect before that.  Dr Misra made no mention of a number of impacts asserted by the claimant. </span></p>

He then began [57] by stating that &#8220;[f]or the reasons I give above there are inconsistencies in those accounts&#8221; &#8211; again showing that the conclusion had by that point been reached, based on the preceding appraisal of the evidence before the judge.

The judge, as recorded at [29], fairly asked him to identify any particular medical evidence he relied upon in support. The claimant did not take the judge to the letter from Mr McDonnell from 2012 stating that his right vision was quite poor because of scarring of the cornea associated with that condition, to which he now referred the EAT. Further, the additional letters provided in the reconsideration application dated from 2009 and showed Mr McDonnell referring the claimant for assessment for a right contact lens (in addition to the left eye lens he already had) following a complication of acute hydrops in the right eye having settled down. The claimant also referred to an entry in his clinical notes from 2010 in which he reported that he had not been wearing the right lens much because it was &#8220;uncomfy and xs movement&#8221;. But none of that evidence was sufficient to show that the judge was wrong not to change his assessment of the impact of the keratoconus, and his ability to use contact lenses to mitigate it, in 2018 &#8211; 2019.</span></p>

HHJ Tayler&#8217;s decision (for which the written reasons were sent in October 2021) noted in terms that he had not appealed the reconsideration decisions. The claimant told me that he thought that he could still raise challenges to them at this hearing, but he had, in my view, no reasonable basis to take that view. The authorities are also very clear that litigants in person are not entitled to particular indulgence in relation to late appeals as such.</span></p>

The judge took on board the claimant&#8217;s points about Dr Whittington&#8217;s evidence. I do not think that the features of the further medical evidence highlighted by the claimant show that the judge&#8217;s appraisal in the original decision was, in relation to any of these impairments, in the legal sense, perverse.</span></p>

In relation to keratoconus, while the reference to this passage does not appear in the initial survey of the evidence, that appears to be because the judge left that survey initially incomplete, stating at [31] that he would return to the other inconsistency and credibility issues, and then, when he did return to them at [61], finding that this passage supported what he had said in the original survey at [30].

In the second reconsideration decision at [15], when referring to the &#8220;other credibility points&#8221; in the original decision, the judge highlights, specifically, the claimant&#8217;s evidence about the impact of his mental ill health on his socialising, discussed in the original decision at [58]. Although the judge refers to the &#8220;other credibility points&#8221; as &#8220;including&#8221; this one, this one appears to have been highlighted because it came </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">after</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> paragraph [57], in which the judge had referred to his appraisal the &#8220;inconsistencies&#8221; discussed in earlier paragraphs, which he found at [57] to be &#8220;supported&#8221; by this passage from Dr Misra. The reconsideration decision does not suggest that his appraisal of the evidence discussed in those earlier paragraphs leading up to [57] held good without the support which he erroneously drew from Dr Misra. That this is not obviously the case is apparent from the thrust of the judge&#8217;s conclusions at [59] that the matters he reviewed &#8220;collectively&#8221; called into question his account and &#8220;spread across the depth and breadth of his account&#8221;. The judge plainly did not rely on the features discussed at [58] as alone, or even mainly, sufficient to his conclusion on the credibility of the claimant&#8217;s evidence about his mental health during the relevant period.  Rather, as he stated at the start of [58], he regarded it as something that &#8220;reinforced&#8221; the &#8220;credibility and consistency&#8221; point that he drew from the evidence reviewed in the earlier paragraphs.</span></p>

At [60] they feed, &#8220;combined&#8221; with other credibility points, in to the conclusion that no weight should be placed on the claimant&#8217;s evidence unless supported elsewhere. This reads as an observation, in the final paragraph of the overall survey all of his evidence relating to all three impairments, as to what has emerged regarding the claimant&#8217;s credibility generally, prior to turning to the conclusions on the three strands of &#8220;the disability issue&#8221;.
