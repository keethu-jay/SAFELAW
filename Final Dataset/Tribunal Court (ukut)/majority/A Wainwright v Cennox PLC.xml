	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000">The ET erred in failing to analyse whether acts of discrimination because of something arising in consequence of the Appellant&#8217;s disability, contrary to </span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000"><ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15 s. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 15</ref> <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Equality Act 2010</ref></span><span style="color:#000000">, as found by it, also amounted to fundamental breaches of contract; if there were such breaches, whether the Appellant nevertheless affirmed her contract; and whether such breaches materially contributed to the Appellant&#8217;s decision to resign, as per </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Williams v Alderman Davies Church in Wales Primary School</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2020] IRLR 589" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2020">[2020] IRLR 589</ref></span><span style="color:#000000">.  That error in turn resulted in the ET&#8217;s failure to consider whether, if the Appellant were constructively dismissed, her dismissal also amounted to an act of discrimination.</span></p>
	    <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#000000">In respect of the claim of &#8216;ordinary&#8217; constructive dismissal, the ET&#8217;s reasons were inadequate in explaining why, as per </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">Nottinghamshire County Council v Meikle</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000"> <ref href="#" uk:canonical="[2004] IRLR 703" uk:isNeutral="false" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2004">[2004] IRLR 703</ref></span><span style="color:#000000">, the fact that the Appellant objected to other actions of the employer, which were found not to be discriminatory, vitiated her acceptance of discriminatory acts, as repudiating her contract.   The Appellant needed to resign in response, at least in part, to the employer&#8217;s fundamental breach of contract, but it need not be the effective cause of her resignation.   </span></p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Appellant appeals against part of the decision of an Employment Tribunal, sitting in East London and chaired by Employment Judge Burgher, which was sent to the parties on 10<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> May 2021.   The ET had dismissed the Appellant&#8217;s claims of direct disability discrimination; victimisation; wrongful dismissal; constructive unfair and discriminatory dismissal.  The ET found that the Appellant&#8217;s claim of discrimination contrary to <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2010/15/section/15" uk:canonical="2010 c. 15 s. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 15</ref> <span style="font-weight:bold">EqA</span> (because of something arising in consequence of the Appellant&#8217;s disability, cancer) was well-founded.   By the time of the renewed grounds before me, the only permitted challenges are to the ET&#8217;s dismissal of the constructive unfair and discriminatory dismissal claims.    The remainder of the ET&#8217;s findings on the other claims are unaffected by this appeal and are preserved, as set out later in these reasons.</p>

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The background facts, as found by the ET, are that the Appellant was a&#160;long-serving employee of her former employer, from 2002, until her resignation with immediate effect on 27<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th </span>September 2019.   Her employment had transferred in January 2018 from a relatively small company to Cennox plc, a larger one, on acquisition, under the <span style="font-weight:bold">Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulation 2006.</span>   As a consequence, whereas previously, the Appellant had worked directly for her employer&#8217;s Managing Director and stood in for her, as needs arose, with the title of Customer Services Director, (as the ET found at paragraphs 39 to 40 of its decision), following her transfer, she no longer reported to the Managing Director and her job title change to that of &#8220;Head of Installations&#8221;, (para. 45).   One area of dispute, as to which I make no findings in this decision, is a suggestion that the Appellant had struggled with her work/life balance, which the Appellant disputed, but which was said to have informed the Respondent&#8217;s decision (para. 52).  </p>

The colleague was a valued employee and partly in order to retain her, the Respondent offered her a&#160;permanent role of Head of Installations, on the assumption that there would be enough work for two Heads of Installation, once the Appellant returned to work (para. 61). The Appellant only learnt of this appointment in November 2018, when she saw a communication on the professional networking website &#8220;LinkedIn&#8221;, inviting congratulations to the Appellant&#8217;s colleague in her new role.  </p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In terms of next developments, the ET found that in July 2019, the Respondent provided the Appellant a new job description and organisation chart, in to which her role fitted. The Appellant was deeply unhappy about both, believing that she had been demoted, whereas the Respondent did not.   This resulted in an impasse, (para. 104) which the Appellant's manager indicated would need to be resolved by way of a&#160;formal grievance.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">When the Appellant then proceeded to raise a formal grievance, the Appellant's UK Managing Director indicated that he was very surprised and disappointed that she wished to do so.

	  <content>
	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There was also a&#160;delay in progressing resolution of the Appellant's grievance.  The ET found that the Appellant did not wish anyone under the managerial responsibility of the UK Managing Director to consider her grievance.   The one employee who had been identified as satisfactory, subsequently became seriously ill, to the extent that he was hospitalised.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the context of that delay, (albeit I&#160;reiterate that I am not making any findings which bind a future ET), the Appellant subsequently resigned.  The ET cited at para. 120 the reasons given by the Appellant for her resignation, which started with a statement that the Appellant was very unhappy about the way she&#160;had been treated and then set out a list of what she regarded as the more serious matters, which included learning, while on sickness absence in 2018, that a colleague had been given her job, querying this but being assured it would not affect her role.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The ET dismissed the Appellant&#8217;s claim of direct discrimination at paras. 149 to 161, for reasons the gist of which is that the ET did not accept that there was less favourable treatment because of the Appellant&#8217;s cancer diagnosis.  The ET identified as a comparator a senior employee on long term sickness absence in a company undergoing organisational change.  While the Respondent had misled the Appellant, this was not because of her disability (para. 158).</p>

Indeed, she stated that she would have accepted the reassignment of responsibilities proposed by [her manager] if she could be given the title of Installations Director. This erroneous view of status was a hangover from her previous post at Acketts [the smaller company] that the Claimant had evidently failed to internally resolve.&#8221;</p>

The Claimant was aware that she was not part of the current organisation structure in March 2019 when [the manager] sent an organogram to her. The Claimant reasonably concluded that this was a temporary arrangement until the Claimant returned. When the Claimant returned discussion took place regarding assignment of responsibilities for an optimal structure. This was not a sham. We are also critical of [the UK Managing Director&#8217;s] email of 2 September 2019 expressing disappointment in the Claimant appealing. However, we do not conclude that the Claimant resigned because of these matters We conclude that she resigned because she was unable to &#8216;negotiate&#8217; a Director title and status in the new structure. She was in a far bigger organisation than Acketts and was not contractually entitled to a higher title.</p>

The Claimant returned to work with suspicions about her role and motivation for the reorganisation but following explanation it should have been clear to her that her suspicions were not well founded because there were justified business reasons for the changes.

Ground (4) is a challenge to the adequacy of the ET&#8217;s reasons.  Ground (5) contends that the ET misapplied the law, in excluding (or failing to consider) one of a number of reasons for resignation.  As per <span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Meikle</span>, the employee&#8217;s resignation must be in response to the breach, but the fact that the Appellant also objected to other actions of the respondent,  would not vitiate the Appellant&#8217;s acceptance of repudiation.

She emphasised, as I&#160;have outlined in the summary at the beginning of these reasons, the Appellant's dissatisfaction with her role following her TUPE transfer to Cennox plc, a&#160;larger business.   Ms White emphasised the ET&#8217;s rejection of the Appellant's claim that the splitting of her role was not genuine or justified for business reasons, and also the ET&#8217;s finding that had the Appellant not been absent due to her disability, the Respondent would have discussed the need for the reorganisation, which was a genuine one (see para. 88).  The Respondent&#8217;s failure was in informing and consulting with the Appellant, not the fact of the reorganisation.   It was the latter that had resulted in the impasse, and the Appellant&#8217;s perception that her role had changed.  Symptomatic of the Appellant&#8217;s perception of her role was her suggestion, by way of a compromise (para. 103), that she should be called &#8220;Installations Director.&#8221;   The ET found that the Appellant&#8217;s perception that she had been demoted was inaccurate (paras. 189 and 190) which was ultimately the reason for her resignation, and that reason alone.</p>

My conclusion is based, in part, on Ms Cullen&#8217;s point that the Appellant had specifically referred in her resignation letter, as recited at para 120, matters in November 2018 which were found to be discriminatory acts, including being misled.   She referred to the same in her witness statement before the ET.   Ms White argues that the ET was entitled to conclude that this was merely the context and not one of the reasons for her dismissal.   However, returning to the example of one of the discriminatory acts, the concealment and misleading of the Appellant, while Ms&#160;Cullen cited numerous examples in the Appellant&#8217;s witness statement that she says were unchallenged as to the treatment she says that caused her to resign, one such that stands out is where the Appellant refers to having been misled and lied to for nearly a&#160;year &#8211; internal para. 306 of her witness statement.  Where the evidence of the contemporaneous resignation letter and the later witness statement is so explicit, a mere rejection of those, as part of the reasons for resigning, demands an explanation, for which there is not one.   I accept Ms Cullen&#8217;s submission that the Appellant is left wondering why her evidence has been rejected.  The ET was not, of course, bound to accept that evidence, but it needed to explain why it did not.</p>

Any last straw needed to add &#8220;something,&#8221; although the last straw itself does not need to be discriminatory or unreasonable (contrary to the ET&#8217;s suggestion at para. 199).

I&#160;regard that as a&#160;realistic assessment, but for completeness, I&#160;accept that the ET did not adequately analyse whether, stand-alone, or cumulatively, the Respondent&#8217;s actions in misleading the Appellant, (as has been found), amounted to potentially repudiatory breaches.
