From June 2017, there were some disagreements between the claimant and Ms Milton. The claimant emailed the CEO, Mr Howells, on 13 August 2017 requesting a meeting as she said that there were serious issues that needed to be discussed. These included the immediate need to bring additional finance support into the organisation which she described as reaching crisis point. A meeting was arranged the next day, on 14 August 2017. At that meeting, the claimant alleged that she was being bullied by Ms Milton, that others were too, that Ms Milton was lazy and incompetent and was taking the claimant&#8217;s staff due to the finance department needing more help. The claimant was upset at this meeting. Mr Howells asked the respondent&#8217;s HR advisers to carry out an independent investigation. Ms Murphy was appointed to undertake that task.</span></p>

These included allegations of a week long campaign of bullying by Ms Milton and an allegation that the claimant had explained personal issues relating to her family&#8217;s mental health to Ms Milton. Ms Milton was alleged to have said to the claimant &#8220;I bet Father&#8217;s Day is hard for you too&#8221; which the claimant felt was a nasty comment regarding the claimant&#8217;s mental health. This was referred to as &#8220;the Father&#8217;s Day comment&#8221;. The claimant also said that she had spoken to others and they felt that Ms Milton did no work and Mr Davies was under lots of pressure because Ms Milton was giving him lots of work to do. </span></p>

Such clarity is helpful in many cases, but it is not fatal if it is not achieved.

Again, in paragraphs 120 to 122, considered above, the ET concluded that there was no disclosure of information in terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/18/section/43" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 43</ref>B.

The employment tribunal will attempt to bring clarity through case management and will endeavour to produce a definitive agreed list of issues for the final hearing.

That can present particular challenges for the employment tribunal charged with determining the case. It is all the more important, in such circumstances, that the EAT reads the whole judgment with that context in mind.

The ET also accepted the respondent&#8217;s explanation that they were aware that the claimant did not have sufficient length of service to claim unfair dismissal and that was why they did not adopt the procedure that might normally be expected.  With these clear findings, even if I had accepted Mr Stephenson&#8217;s arguments that the ET had erred in its approach to protected disclosures, protected acts or the onus of proof, the outcome of the claims that related to dismissal would have been the same. </span></p>
