The risk assessment is based upon the reports that [D] has eloped from school, has eloped from home and has required restraint in the community (in the form of a harness and being physically supported away from roads etc) in order to keep him safe and walking with a caregiver. Additionally he has attempted to board buses and take items from shops and may cause damage to others and property in the community and there have been reports that he has run out in front of cars. This information regarding his behaviours has informed our decision that he would need 2:1 in the community to ensure his safety.</span></p>

The parties agreed that as a Key Stage 3 child it is right that [D] experiences the wider world, but we found that 5 hours used flexibly across a teaching week (notwithstanding additional social care time relevant to accessing outdoor experiences) is adequate to meet his needs, within the context of the teaching time each week.

Assuming the harness-exclusion was retained (the SOR does not say otherwise), what sort of restraint was anticipated, and for which the additional support worker required restraint training? On the face of it, arguably the EHC Plan anticipated restraint in the form of laying hands on D to inhibit his movement. If a harness was out of the equation, how else could he be restrained in the community?</span></p>

It refers to Skybound&#8217;s observations of D when accessing the community with a family member. A harness was used to restrain D 62 times during a 70-minute observation, in response to him pulling away. Skybound were unwilling to arrange community access unless D had 2:1 support but would review that ratio regularly to monitor the frequency with which two support workers had been needed in practice. But the Skybound team were unable to use a harness due to both a lack of training and the risk of injury to staff and D given his age and size. This is consistent with Working Document 16 which, as just noted, excluded use of a Houdini harness. </span></p>

I think it is unarguable that the everyday understanding is something like this: individual 1 uses physical force, with or without the assistance of some device or in conjunction with another individual/s, upon the person of individual 2 in circumstances in which individual 2 does not or cannot consent to the procedure. It is also clear that improper use of restraint has the potential for causing significant breaches of an individual&#8217;s rights. Bearing that in mind, the argument that the FtT erred in law by failing to define &#8216;restraint&#8217; or set out permitted types of restraint (other than the excluded harness), has a realistic prospect of success. This is the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial">third ground of appeal</span><span style="font-family:Arial">. I also observe that, arguably, the need for specificity is heightened in respect of restraint-related provision so that all professionals are left in no doubt as to what is, and is not, permitted, so that the risk of violating an individual&#8217;s rights is correspondingly reduced.</span></p>

This is the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial">fourth ground of appeal</span><span style="font-family:Arial">. The Appellants submit that their submission was supported by expert evidence, but the FtT&#8217;s reasons arguably failed to engage with the parental case in any meaningful way. As matter of general principle, a fuller explanation than would suffice for other section F provision (provision which does not touch on fundamental rights in the same way as restraint-related provision) is required for reasons for restraint-related provision to be adequate.</span></p>

The FtT preferred the local authority&#8217;s assessment evidence to Ms Long&#8217;s first report on the ground that it was thorough and the reference point for Ms Long&#8217;s report (D being educated at school) had been superseded. In oral argument before me, the Appellants acknowledged that Ms Long&#8217;s report did not deal with D&#8217;s needs if educated at home, but that was because, in April 2021, it was thought that D would be educated at school. This effectively innocent deficiency was remedied in the 22 April 2022 report, but the Tribunal failed to take this into account.</span></p>

The first report had obviously become out-of-date, to some extent, since it was written when the plan was for D to attend a school. That deficiency was remedied, say the Appellants, in Ms Long&#8217;s second report, yet the FtT&#8217;s reasons say nothing about this report.  The Appellant&#8217;s have established an arguable case that the Tribunal erred in law in its treatment of Ms Long&#8217;s second report by failing to take it into account and/or by providing inadequate reasons for preferring the local authority&#8217;s February 2021 assessment. This is the </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial">fifth ground of appeal</span><span style="font-family:Arial">. I should note that, if the extent of the Appellants&#8217; reliance on Ms Long&#8217;s second report was limited to those parts referred to in the parental amendments to version 16 of the Working Document (see below), any error might be immaterial. </span></p>

The EHC Plan identifies no need for physical restraint. The EHC Plan provision that refers to restraint was simply the First-tier Tribunal&#8217;s attempt to summarise Skybound&#8217;s evidence that community supervisors should be &#8220;trained in the same physical intervention skills and showing competence at application of the Behaviour Support Plan&#8221; (see Skybound&#8217;s report). Furthermore, the reference to restraint is found in the &#8216;provider / by whom&#8217; column of the EHC Plan rather than the provision column. The EHC Plan does not order restraint provision; the Plan, in this respect, only determines the training required of those who supervise D in the community.

Fairness did not require the Tribunal to pause making its decision so that the Appellants could comment on the authority&#8217;s specific proposal.

Ms Dennison&#8217;s email of 29 April 2022 said that D&#8217;s behaviour when accessing the community meant that, if only one support worker accompanied him, there would be a risk of death or serious life-changing injuries to D or others. Ms Dennison also wrote, &#8220;all physical intervention training that I am aware of would require 2 people to support someone who is eloping&#8221;. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from this statement is that Ms Dennison thought that whoever accompanied D in the community needed to have &#8216;physical intervention training&#8217;. The First-tier Tribunal&#8217;s requirement for the additional support worker to have restraint training was, as with six-weekly risk assessments, no more than a reformulation, without material alteration, of Ms Dennison&#8217;s recommendation.

The Appellant&#8217;s final written submissions to the Tribunal, which were not before me when I granted permission to appeal, argued that two people should be available to &#8220;use fluid restraint and/or two-person escort techniques to keep him safe&#8221;, that D &#8220;cannot be restrained or escorted safely by one person&#8221;, and &#8220;the use of ongoing physical restraint of this sort is undignified and unsafe&#8221; which was a reference to the Houdini harness referred to earlier in the submissions. Moreover, Ms Dennison&#8217;s email of 29 April 2022 anticipated the need for some kind of &#8216;physical intervention&#8217;, from two people, to keep D safe when accessing the community. The Appellant&#8217;s case was not that D should be free of all physical restraint in the community. This undermines the basis on which permission to appeal was granted on Ground 4. The Tribunal did not reject the parental case put to it about restraint.</span></p>

As I have just explained, that cannot have been the case. The fact is that the potential type/s of restraint anticipated was described in the Appellant&#8217;s own evidence. In those circumstances, I am satisfied that the Tribunal did not err in law by failing to specify the type/s of restraint that it had in mind when making provision for the additional support worker to have restraint training. A counsel of perfection might have called for a more detailed description of the types of restraint techniques for which training was required. However, a Tribunal&#8217;s reasons are not required to be perfect and, in a case where the Appellant&#8217;s own case signalled the type of restraint techniques considered suitable, the requirement to provide sufficient reasons was discharged by the Tribunal&#8217;s requirement for the additional support worker to have restraint training albeit of an unspecified type.</span></p>

In the circumstances, neither argument is persuasive. If Ms Long&#8217;s 2021 report merited specific consideration in the Tribunal&#8217;s reasons, then so did the 2022 addendum to that report, all the more so because the addendum, unlike the 2021 report, related to D&#8217;s newly altered educational circumstances. The Tribunal&#8217;s rationale for rejecting the 2021 report included that it was drafted on the assumption that D would be educated at school. That did not apply to the addendum report and so could not have been relied on to reject it. The Tribunal&#8217;s reasons say nothing about why Ms Long&#8217;s 2022 addendum report was rejected and that rendered the reasons given for the Tribunal&#8217;s insufficient.</span></p>

	    <p style="text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">This appeal succeeds on a single ground. The First-tier Tribunal&#8217;s decision involved an error on a point of law because it did not give sufficient reasons for its decision. In the circumstances, the Tribunal was required to give some explanation for its rejection of Ms Long&#8217;s April 2022 addendum report. Despite the Tribunal having erred in law, I have decided not to set aside its decision. The Tribunal&#8217;s error related to its discretionary power to give a social care recommendation. Even if the Tribunal had not erred, and given the recommendation sought by the Appellant, the relevant local (social care) authority was not bound to accept the recommendation. By contrast, where a Tribunal orders special educational provision in Section F of an EHC Plan, the relevant local authority is required by <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/15/section/42/2" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 42(2)</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2007/15" uk:canonical="2007 c. 15" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 2007 Act</ref> to secure that the provision is made. In my judgment, this distinction is a relevant consideration for the Upper Tribunal in deciding how to dispose of an appeal after finding that the First-tier Tribunal erred in law in the exercise of its recommendation power but whose decision, insofar as it relates to special educational matters, is free of legal error. It is also probable that matters have developed in D&#8217;s life so that Ms Long&#8217;s addendum report no longer speaks to D&#8217;s current circumstances. If that is the case, how would the First-tier Tribunal be supposed to remedy the deficiency identified by the Upper Tribunal? It would be faced with an Upper Tribunal decision that finds it erred in law in its treatment of a report that is no longer relevant and, for that reason, could not properly be taken into account since the Tribunal is required to address current circumstances (see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;color:#000000">Wilkin v Goldthorpe (Chair of the SEN Tribunal) </span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000">CO/1251/97 and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial;color:#000000">Gloucestershire County Council v EH </span><span style="font-family:Arial;color:#000000"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukut/aac/2017/85" uk:canonical="[2017] UKUT 85 (AAC)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2017">(2017) UKUT 85 (AAC)</ref>)</span><span style="font-family:Arial">. I also note that, according to the Appellant, a subsequent iteration of D&#8217;s EHC Plan is under appeal to the First-tier Tribunal and would not wish to complicate those proceedings by remitting this matter to that tribunal without a good reason for doing so. For these reasons, I decide not to set aside the First-tier Tribunal&#8217;s decision. </span></p>

There have also been some unfortunate administrative oversights, which I have described above in these reasons and for which I apologise on behalf of the Upper Tribunal. Latterly, the delay is a result of my prolonged absence from duties, and subsequent limited duties, while recovering from serious injuries sustained in an accident. I am sorry for the frustration likely to have been experienced by the Appellant while waiting for this decision. </span></p>
