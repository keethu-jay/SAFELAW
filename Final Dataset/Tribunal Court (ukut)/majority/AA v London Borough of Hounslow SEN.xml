      <p><span style="font-weight:bold">SPECIAL EDUCATIONAL NEEDS (85) </span></p>
      <p>The appellant (C&#8217;s parent) expressed a preference for a maintained mainstream school (School O); the local authority named a maintained mainstream school with an autism resource base (School S) in Section I of C&#8217;s EHC Plan. The appellant wanted C to have a &#8216;mainstream experience&#8217; rather than being placed in a base. The Tribunal applied section 39(4) of the Children and Families Act 2014 (CFA 2014) and found School O to be unsuitable, in particular because C would be in an ordinary mainstream class of 30 pupils; the Tribunal named School S. The appellant argued that the Tribunal had erred in law by failing properly to apply the so-called &#8216;right to mainstream&#8217; in section 33 of the CFA 2014 and/or by failing to consider section 9 of the Education Act 1996 (EA 1996).</p>
      <p>The Upper Tribunal gives guidance on the interpretation and application of relevant statutory provisions. The Upper Tribunal holds that the First-tier Tribunal did not err in its application of section 33, which is not a &#8216;right to a mainstream experience&#8217;. Section 33(2) places a duty on the local authority to name a mainstream school when the application of section 39(4) has resulted in parent&#8217;s preferred school being rejected, unless naming a mainstream school is incompatible: (a) with the wishes of the parent; or (b) provision of efficient education to others. Naming School S complied with that duty because parental preference was for mainstream (albeit not that particular school) and the local authority was not relying on the exception in section 33(2)(b) for incompatibility with the efficient education of others so the duty in section 33(4) to take reasonable steps to avoid the incompatibility did not apply.</p>
      <p>The Tribunal erred in law by failing to consider section 9 of the EA 1996 when deciding which school it was &#8216;appropriate&#8217; to name under section 39(5). However, the error was not material as it was inconceivable in this particular case that the application of section 9 would have made any difference.</p>

Two mainstream schools were in issue in this appeal. The local authority proposed School S, a mainstream maintained primary school with an autism resource base. Parental preference was for School O, an &#8216;ordinary&#8217; maintained mainstream primary school. The Tribunal concluded that School O was unsuitable for the appellant&#8217;s child (who I will call C) and named School S in Section I of the C&#8217;s Education Health and Care Plan (EHC Plan).</span></p>

She has a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Developmental delay. She has difficulties with speech and language as well as social communication, emotional and sensory regulation. She had attended various nursery/pre-school provisions from autumn 2023 and had been receiving Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) provision at home since February 2022. In her most recent nursery placement she had been supported by an ABA tutor for 2 hours per day. She was otherwise in a group where the staffing ratio was 3 staff to 12-15 pupils, although some attend mornings only. C was due to start Reception in September 2024. (In the event, I am told that, as the appellant&#8217;s appeal did not succeed at the Tribunal, she has kept C out of school so that C has not yet started at primary school.)</span></p>

	      <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:Arial">Before the First-tier Tribunal, the appellant and the local authority proposed two different models for C&#8217;s education. The appellant sought a placement in a maintained mainstream primary school at School O, together with ABA provision of 32.5 hours per week during term time and 15-20 hours per week during holidays. The local authority, however, decided to name School S, a maintained mainstream primary school with a specialist ASD resource base. The appellant envisaged that, at School O, C would spend most of her time in a mainstream class of approximately 30 children, albeit supported at all times on a 1:1 basis. The proposal at School S was that C would spend most of her time in the resource base, which was a class of five children, but would have opportunities for interacting with peers in the mainstream classes. School S is &#8216;in borough&#8217; (2.5 miles from parents&#8217; home); School O is &#8216;out of borough&#8217; (3.1 miles from parents&#8217; home). The First-tier Tribunal confirmed at [14] of its decision that the appellant was &#8216;seeking transport costs&#8217;. The significance of that was that, if cost was in issue, the First-tier Tribunal would have had to take into account the cost of transporting C to School O; the appellant was not offering to provide transport herself. </span></p>

As to placement, the Tribunal concluded that School O was unsuitable and that School S should be named. It is appropriate to set out the whole of the Tribunal&#8217;s reasons on this issue:-</span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The LA relied on the oral evidence of [Ms F] of School S to show that a suitable school was available, as well as her written evidence.  Her evidence was that the school can meet needs and make the provision in section B and F of the EHC Plan.  [C] would be in small class with 5 other pupils and 1 full time teacher and TA and one nearly full time TA.  There is a high ratio of staff to pupils. The experience of the staff is that they are a specialist unit for pupils with ASD. They understand the communication and related difficulties associated with ASD. The assessment and transition plan was realistic. [C] will have the opportunity to access the mainstream as soon as she is ready.  She will in any event be able to go on outings with the relevant group in the mainstream.  </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The rate at which this happens is flexible and will depend on how [C] copes.  This is eminently sensible.  Mr Chothi seemed to suggest that this did not constitute mainstream provision, which is what the Appellant wants. This is plainly wrong. This is placement at a mainstream school, albeit in a unit within the school.  [Ms F] was a persuasive witness and there was no reason to doubt her knowledge and commitment. With the 25 hours of 1:1 support as well as OT and SLT provision, there is no reason why [C] should not flourish. [Ms F] spoke about the provision and supervision at lunch times for eating in the centre, which will benefit [C]. The school is rated Good and outstanding for personal development and Early Years provision which is what [C] will be in. </span></p>

The Tribunal considered the letter from [School O] which states that [AA] has stated that Richmond Borough allow ABA therapists to support children in settings. [The Headteacher] makes clear that [School O], is not an ABA school and it does not follow or support ABA therapies. She refers to class sizes of 30 pupils.  She states that the </span></p>

She speaks about being tight on space and the adverse impact on other pupils. There is not sufficient information on this point) to meet [C&#8217;s] toileting needs. Additional support would be needed. There are no therapists on site for SLT and OT provision. Mr Frank stated that he had spoken to the school today and their position remains unchanged. [AA] suggested that she had spoken to the school recently and they had no problem with accommodating ABA support. This would be a major shift from the position in the letter, and from the no change discussion Mr Frank referred to. From the limited information available, the Tribunal do not consider that a class size of 30 pupils is suitable for [C]. The small group work in her plan in class sizes of 4-5 pupils may not be achievable, even if the additional 1:1 support was available to her. She displays sensory sensitivities and sensory avoidant behaviours and struggles with certain sounds and noises. A class size of 30 is bound to cause her sensory difficulties. Mr Chothi suggested that the parental preference for this mainstream school was conclusive. It is not. The Tribunal has concerns that the school is not suitable for [C&#8217;s] age, ability and aptitude on the basis of the limited information available to it. [AA] expressed a serious preference for [School O] and serious concerns that [C] would mimic negative behaviours from other children with SEN needs and she wanted a mainstream school as a consequence. It is not beyond possibility that she may pick up and mimic </span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-family:Arial">negative behaviours from children in a mainstream setting. Moreover, with the level of 1:1 support the opportunity for doing so will be greatly reduced. [School O] had an Outstanding Ofsted rating but this is noted to be from 2014. Even if [School O] had the resources available to implement 1:1,  OT and SLT support/therapies would not be available on site as is the case with [School S], which is an important benefit for [C]. The size of the classes, lack of onsite provision for therapies and lack of specialist provision for a child with ASD make this school unsuitable.  School S is suitable and can meet the needs and provision in the EHC Plan and shall be named in section I.</span></p>

The assessment of the child&#8217;s needs necessarily imports elements of a welfare judgment. If there are two schools offering facilities and standards that exceed the test of adequacy, then I would hope that ordinarily speaking the better would be judged appropriate, assuming no mismatch between specific facilities and specific needs. Parental preference obviously has a part to play in the assessment of what is appropriate. In a case where there appears to be parity of cost and parity of facilities, parental preference may be the decisive factor. But it would be wrong to elevate parental preference to the height that Mr Bowen appeared to contend for in his submissions. A bare preference might be ill-informed or capricious. In practice, parental preference may mean a fair opportunity to the parents to contend by evidence and argument for one school in preference to another. Therefore, preferences must be reasoned to enable the parent to demonstrate that they rest on a sound</span></p>

		<p style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">My initial instinct was to the contrary, and accorded with the provisional view of Judge Jacobs. How could a school which was &#8220;unsuitable&#8221; for the special educational needs of the child in question be &#8220;appropriate&#8221; for that same child? To be appropriate, a school must be able to match what the child needs (see per Thorpe LJ in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">C v Buckinghamshire CC &amp; Special Educational Needs Tribunal </span><span style="font-family:Arial">[1999] ELR 179). The answer is that the right to mainstream schooling is a stronger right than the right to request a particular school. The right to request a school can be displaced where that school is unsuitable. The duty to provide mainstream schooling somewhere cannot be displaced by the unsuitability of a particular school, or even of all schools in the area. The local authority has to make a school appropriate, if necessary by spending money to do so. So a school which is currently &#8220;unsuitable&#8221; may nevertheless become &#8220;appropriate&#8221; once upgraded.</span></p>

But there may well be circumstances where the requested but unsuitable school would nevertheless be named in the final EHC plan.

For instance, there might be two mainstream schools, one costing &#163;60,000 per year and one &#163;80,000 a year to provide for a pupil with special educational needs in a manner which avoided incompatibility with the provision of efficient education for other children.  Those substantial costs will not in general terms be relevant to the decision to place the child in a mainstream school as opposed to a special school: see e.g. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">Bury</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> at [23], and </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">Harrow LBC v AM </span><span style="font-family:Arial"><ref href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukut/aac/2013/0157" uk:canonical="[2013] UKUT 0157 (AAC)" uk:isNeutral="true" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="case" uk:year="2013">[2013] UKUT 0157 (AAC)</ref>.

I add (in the light of the observation I have made above about the care that needs to be taken in deciding whether an institution counts as a mainstream or a special school for the purposes of the legislation) that in this case, it is clear that the ASD resource base operates as part of the mainstream school, with the children from the base joining with the children from the mainstream classes for certain activities, and the plan in C&#8217;s case being to work towards further elements of integration with the mainstream classes.</p>

The parties were equivocal in their answers to this question when I asked them at the hearing, so the point was not fully argued, but it seems to me that, as a matter of ordinary meaning, the concept of &#8220;efficient instruction and training&#8221; is different to suitability. It is, for example, quite possible as a matter of ordinary English to conceive of teaching being suitable but inefficient or efficient but unsuitable. I further observe that, in the light of the authorities discussed above (in particular Judge Mesher&#8217;s decision in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">NA v London Borough of Barnet</span><span style="font-family:Arial">), &#8216;incompatibility&#8217; is a strong test. It encompasses consideration of what can be done to avoid the incompatibility. In that respect, the test of &#8216;incompatibility&#8217; can be regarded as carrying within it the need to consider similar matters to those that <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/6/section/33/4" uk:canonical="2014 c. 6 s. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(4)</ref> would have required the Tribunal to consider in this case, if it had applied, but with the difference being that, while <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/6/section/33/4" uk:canonical="2014 c. 6 s. 33" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 33(4)</ref> is a duty to take reasonable steps to address incompatibility with the efficient education of others, <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1996/56/section/9" uk:canonical="1996 c. 56 s. 9" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 9</ref> would in addition require consideration of what steps could be taken to avoid incompatibility with the provision of efficient instruction and training for C herself. In contrast, I am not convinced that the test of whether a school is &#8216;unsuitable&#8217; under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2014/6/section/39/4" uk:canonical="2014 c. 6 s. 39" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 39(4)</ref>(a) necessarily encompasses the same sort of consideration (although in the ordinary course the Tribunal will in deciding whether a school is suitable bear in mind the various statutory duties on the school and the local authority that I have referred to above to make appropriate provision for children with special educational needs). </span></p>

In particular, he criticised the Tribunal&#8217;s conclusion that a class size of 30 was unsuitable for C, pointing out that she had been in a mainstream nursery and would have full-time 1:1 support. For completeness, I record that these are not in my judgment good grounds of challenge to the Tribunal&#8217;s decision. The evidence was that C&#8217;s nursery provision consisted of a small group of 12-15 children supervised by 3 adults. It cannot be said that it was perverse in the light of that evidence for the Tribunal to conclude that a class size of 30 was unsuitable. Further, the Tribunal had plainly not left out of account in assessing the suitability of School O that C would have full-time 1:1 support because it mentions it again in [30].)</span></p>

The latter is what happened here; it happened after full consideration had been given to the parents&#8217; reasons for making a different choice; and it is in my view inconceivable that it could have made any difference had the tribunal added in the bare fact that the school which it judged more appropriate to N&#8217;s needs was not the one favoured by the parents.</span></p>

I do not consider that the Tribunal erred in law in this case in proceeding on the basis of the evidence it had. The appellant was represented by an experienced advisor. She had not sought an adjournment because a witness from School O was not available, although it ought to have been obvious that the lack of a witness from the school would be disadvantageous to the appellant&#8217;s case. Although a Tribunal may err in law if it fails to raise the question of an adjournment of its own motion in circumstances where a party has not had a reasonable opportunity to put their case, or where the Tribunal does not have before it sufficient evidence to determine whether any school is suitable, or to determine some other issue that is crucial to the fair and just determination of the appeal, this was not such a case. The appellant had had a reasonable opportunity to advance her case and the Tribunal had sufficient evidence before it both to determine that School S was suitable and to make a determination about the suitability of School O. It could have had more evidence about School O, and it might have been better if it did, but it was not an error of law to proceed on what it had.</span></p>

The open justice principle is important, and publication of parties&#8217; names is important to the effectiveness of that principle. However, these proceedings are concerned with the upbringing and education of a child whose age and needs are such that she can have no say in these proceedings. The case was heard in private before the First-tier Tribunal and the appellant (and C) could reasonably assume when they commenced these proceedings that their identities would not enter the public domain as a result. In this case, I consider that the appropriate balance between C&#8217;s rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights is struck by holding this hearing in public and publishing this judgment. The names of C and the appellant add very little to the public interest in open justice in this case. On the other hand, the impact on them of their identities being included in this judgment (which will remain accessible to the general public online indefinitely) could be significant. I therefore make an order under rule 14 of the Upper Tribunal Rules in the terms set out at the start of this decision.</span></p>
