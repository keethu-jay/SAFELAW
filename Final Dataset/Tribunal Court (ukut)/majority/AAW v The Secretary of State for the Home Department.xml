Any opinion offered that is unsupported by a demonstration of the objectivity and comprehensive review of material facts required of an expert witness is likely to be afforded little weight by the Tribunal. In particular, a witness who does not engage with material facts or issues that might detract from the view being expressed risks being regarded as an informed advocate for the case of one of the parties to the proceedings rather than an independent expert witness.</span></p>

By a decision dated 14 July, Judge O&#8217;Connor found that the First-tier Tribunal had made errors of law such as to require the determination to be set aside. His reasons for so finding are set out in the decision that is annexed hereto. Judge O&#8217;Connor said this about the circumstances leading to the decision to make a deportation order:</span></p>

Therefore, as Mr Gilbert, realistically, does not pursue either any grounds founded upon rights protected by Article 8 of the ECHR we are concerned only with the question of whether, upon return to Mogadishu, the appellant would be subjected to ill-treatment or would find himself living in conditions such as to amount to an infringement of Article 3 of the ECHR.</span></p>

He lived with his parents and siblings in </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Moga</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">dishu</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">. They are of the </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Shanshiya</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> clan, which is a sub clan of the </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Benadiri</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> and so a minority clan. That was a matter of fact initially in dispute but Mr Jarvis does not now pursue that challenge and so the appellant is to be considered to be of the clan he asserts. The appellant&#8217;s father was a merchant, selling shoes and some livestock. As the appellant confirmed in his oral evidence before us, the family had the patronage of a local </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Hawiye</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> man as a result of which the appellant&#8217;s father prospered in his business and the appellant was able to attend school. They owned and lived in their own house, which had six bedrooms.</span></p>

They therefore left </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Mogadishu</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> and moved to </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Marka</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> on the south coast of </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Mogadishu</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">, where the appellant&#8217;s father rented a house and opened a new shop. Unfortunately, after two years or so, the fighting spread to </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Marka</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> and so the family moved across the border into </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Kenya</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">, where they lived in a refugee camp.</span></p>

In oral evidence the appellant explained how this was possible, given that they were of a minority clan and on that basis at extreme risk when passing through the many militia controlled checkpoints they encountered on their journey. He said that the bus driver bribed his way through the checkpoints outside </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Mogadishu</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> and, when asked about how they got through the checkpoints within </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Mogadishu</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">, the appellant explained that:</span></p>

The family would return and this man had agreed to buy their house for $40,000. The appellant&#8217;s father would then rent a house and start a new business. Unfortunately, when they arrived in </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Mogadishu</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> they found that others from a majority clan had moved into their house and taken it over and so, for a few months, they stayed at the home of the man trusted by his father who had agreed to buy the house. After that man had secured vacant possession</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">,</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> the sale proceeded and so the appellant and his family moved into a rented house.</span></p>

In oral evidence he explained that this was because &#8220;there was no peace&#8221;. That decision was certainly not driven by a shortage of funds because they had the proceeds of the sale of their house. It emerged in evidence that the &#8220;IDP camp&#8221; was a vacant government building, in which the appellant&#8217;s parents remained resident after their two sons had departed. Each son received from their parents the sum of $5,000 to fund their journey, their parents retaining for their own use the remaining $30,000.</span></p>

In so doing she explained that she relied mainly upon mainly unidentified but &#8220;tried and tested&#8221; sources who she has worked with in the past in her career of journalism. But, as was observed by Mr Jarvis, the assessment of the reliability of a source is a task for the Tribunal and not for a witness offering evidence to it and, if the sources are not revealed, and not even the notes kept of any conversations with those sources are produced, it is hard to see that very much weight can be afforded to views founded upon information provided by such sources.</span></p>

He entered the United Kingdom on 11 November 1998 and claimed asylum.  That application was refused and an appeal against such refusal was subsequently dismissed.  Thereafter the appellant made a further asylum claim in April 2006, giving a false name and date of birth, but that application was subsequently refused on non-compliance grounds. </span></p>

This led the Secretary of State to make a decision to deport him pursuant to section 5(1) of the Immigration Act 1971. The First-tier Tribunal identifies such decision as having been made on 5 June 2014 &#8211; although on its face it is undated.  On this same date a deportation order was signed in the appellant&#8217;s name.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">It is prudent for me first to set out the core paragraphs of the Panel&#8217;s determination upon which both parties sought to rely:</span></p>
      </blockContainer>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1.18in;text-indent:-0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">&#8220;38.</span><marker name="tab"/><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">We cannot conclude definitively that upon return to Mogadishu the appellant would have support from his own clan.  According to the appellant&#8217;s account he has no family members in Mogadishu.  However, the appellant is a resourceful individual.  He came to the United Kingdom when he was 24 years of age.  The United Kingdom, at that time, was an alien country to him and he has managed to survive here without the support of clan and family members.  We note that the appellant has a brother in the United Kingdom but according to his account he is not on talking terms.  We further note that the appellant has obtained certificates in alcohol awareness; mathematics; basic construction skills; cleaning professionals skills suite; awarded mentoring; a diploma in wall and floor tiling; an awarded functional skills qualification in English; and certificates in information technology.  </span></p>

Upon return to Mogadishu he could put to use the skills and certificates he has obtained in the United Kingdom.  We note that the expert report concludes that the appellant may well be at risk upon return due to his atheism, criminal convictions and length of stay in the United Kingdom.  However, those conclusions do not fit in with the country guidance case of </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">MOJ &amp; Others</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">.  The situation in Mogadishu has significantly changed, certainly with the absence of Al Shabab.  There is nothing to suggest that the appellant&#8217;s past, upon return, would be disclosed to the authorities or any other organisation in Somalia.  There is no real explanation, in view of the appellant&#8217;s subjective fear, why, on at least two occasions he made an application for voluntary return to Somalia.  In light of the case of </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">MOJ &amp; Others</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">, we find that the appellant faces no real risk of serious harm or ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the ECHR.&#8221; </span></p>

[AAW] would face immense prejudice and possible violence if other people in Mogadishu knew of his beliefs.  Somalia has become increasingly religiously conservative since the collapse of effective central government in 1991, partly as a result of years of funding from Saudi Arabia for madrasas and mosques at a time when the rest of the world had largely abandoned the country to its own devices.&#8221;</span></p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">&#8220;Absent some aspect of a person&#8217;s profile making him of particular adverse interest to Al Shabaab or to the authorities as a possible supporter of Al Shabaab there is not a general risk for a civilian simply by being present in the city, of serious harm as a result of indiscriminate violence.&#8221;</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">This conclusory paragraph leaves open the possibility that there may be a risk from Al Shabaab if a person&#8217;s profile makes them of particular adverse interest to that organisation. Ms Harper evidence is not inconsistent with this. Given what is said in paragraph 399 of </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">MOJ</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> I conclude that it was not lawful for the Panel to dispose on this limb of the appellant&#8217;s case on the basis that it did.  </span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Moving on to the relevance of the appellant&#8217;s previous offending.  At paragraph 479 of its decision the Tribunal in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">MOJ</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> said:</span></p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">&#8220;Mr Toal submitted that SSM [one of the appellants in MOJ] would face further difficulties precisely because he is being deported on account of having committed criminal offences in this country. There was not a clear consensus in the expert evidence about this matter but we are satisfied that, absent some aspect of the offending disclosing characteristics such as to offend core Somalis </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt">mores</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';font-size:11pt"> (which is not the case here), simple criminality on a returnee&#8217;s part, even if it somehow came to be known about, would not cause anyone to act any differently towards him.&#8221;</span></p>

	<num>20.</num>
	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Ms Harper opined in the instant case that the appellant&#8217;s criminal history would lead him to be at increased risk, ostracised and looked down upon in Mogadishu (which would also have an impact on his employability there) if such history, and in particular the convictions for committing sexual offences, were to become known.  As to how this history would become known in Mogadishu Ms Harper provided evidence of significant communication lines between the Diaspora in the United Kingdom and persons in Mogadishu and opined that the appellant would be &#8220;unlikely&#8221; to be able to hide his history of criminality if her were to be returned.</span></p>

	<p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">I agree with Mr Gilbert that in doing so the Panel both failed to take into account a material matter, and failed to consider the level of the appellant&#8217;s resourcefulness in its proper and full context &#8211; the appellant having been an alcoholic and homeless in the UK from 2003 to at least 2006, and possibility later.  This is clearly a relevant factor in any consideration of the circumstances that the appellant might find himself in if returned to Mogadishu. </span></p>

That submission is difficult in light of the directions that were sent to the parties and, in particular, the indication therein that the initial hearing would be limited to determining whether there was an error of law in the First-tier Tribunal&#8217;s determination, absent there being a need for further oral evidence to be given. However, although no additional witness statement has been provided in this regard, it is envisaged that such further evidence will be given by the appellant.</span></p>
