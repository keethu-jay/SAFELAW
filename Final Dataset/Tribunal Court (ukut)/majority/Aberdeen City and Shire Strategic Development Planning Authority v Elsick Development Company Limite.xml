	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">This appeal raises an important question of planning law. A planning authority foresees and plans for significant growth in its area. Major investment in transport infrastructure is required to accommodate the aggregate of the planned development. The planning authority seeks to achieve this investment by adopting a policy in its development plan which in substance requires developers to enter into planning obligations with it to make financial contributions to the pooled fund to be spent on the infrastructure, including interventions at places where a particular development has only a trivial impact. Is such a policy within the existing powers of the planning authority under current planning legislation?</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Aberdeen City and Shire Strategic Development Planning Authority (&#8220;the Authority&#8221;) has the responsibility for preparing a strategic development plan for its area. The Authority foresaw the need for significant new and improved infrastructure to accommodate the cumulative impact of new development for which it planned. There were already proposals for transport infrastructure which involved major public sector investment, including the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (&#8220;AWPR&#8221;), new bridges, park and ride sites, making the A96 into a dual carriageway road and the creation of twin tracks on significant parts of the Aberdeen-Inverness railway line, all of which was to be paid for out of public funds. In 2010 the North-East of Scotland Transport Partnership (&#8220;Nestrans&#8221;) commissioned a cumulative transport appraisal for the area (&#8220;the CTA&#8221;), in which it estimated that &#163;86.6m was required on top of already committed public sector investment in order to fund a package of infrastructure developments, which it identified, to address the cumulative impact of the proposed new development in the area.</p>

In February 2013 the Authority published its proposed strategic development plan. In that plan the Authority stated that it intended to prepare supplementary guidance in support of the plan. This guidance would allow for the Fund to deliver the transport projects which were needed to deal with the combined effect of new development in four identified strategic growth areas within the Aberdeen Housing Market Area. The Authority stated that it would need to secure a higher percentage of the increase in land values, which resulted from the grant of planning permission, than it had in the past in order to be able to create sustainable mixed communities.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Elsick also objected to the proposed strategic development plan and sought to have the reference to the Fund removed from that plan on the ground that it was contrary to the guidance of the Scottish Ministers on planning obligations which is set out in circular 3/2012, &#8220;Planning Obligations and Good Neighbour Agreements&#8221; (&#8220;the Circular&#8221;). The Circular advised planning authorities to seek to have developers enter into planning obligations only if the obligations met specified tests. These tests were that the obligations (i) were necessary to make the proposed development acceptable in planning terms (para 15), (ii) served a planning purpose (para 16), (iii) related to the proposed development either as a direct consequence of the development or arising from the cumulative impact of development in the area (paras 17-19), (iv) fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the proposed development (paras 20-23), and (v) were reasonable in all other respects. Elsick&#8217;s principal concern was with (iv); Elsick asserted that the contribution to the Fund which the proposed plan envisaged was out of all proportion to the demands which its development would make on the infrastructure which expenditure from the Fund was to improve.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The proposed strategic development plan was examined by a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers. In his report dated 21 January 2014 the reporter stated that it was right that the principle of the Fund should be established in the development plan and concluded that the CTA had demonstrated that the overall traffic growth, which the development promoted in the plan would create, would have harmful effects unless there were mitigation measures. He expressed concern that the mechanism for raising contributions to the Fund did not comply with national policy in the Circular because there was not a sufficiently clear and direct relationship between the development supplying the contribution and the infrastructure to be delivered. He advised that para 5.9 of the proposed plan be amended &#8220;to establish that the Fund will only be used to gather contributions towards infrastructure improvements that are related to the developments concerned and strictly necessary in order to make any individual development acceptable in planning terms&#8221;.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Authority then resolved to convert the non-statutory supplementary planning guidance into statutory guidance. On 12 December 2014 the Authority issued a consultation draft of the proposed statutory guidance. In a report to the meeting of the Authority which approved the consultation draft it was explained that the consultants who had prepared the CTA had re-presented table 7.2 of the study, which I discuss in more detail in para 16 below, to show a clear and direct link between the development providing a contribution to the Fund and the infrastructure improvement to be delivered. The report also stated that the supplementary guidance was</p>

The main driving force behind the preparation of the existing non-statutory guidance was the need to facilitate development rather than leave it to individual developers to try to satisfy Transport Scotland and the two councils that they had adequately mitigated all their cumulative impacts on the transport network.&#8221;</p>

The Authority responded to Elsick&#8217;s representations by stating that all but one of the transport interventions were within a three-mile radius of Aberdeen City centre and had strong inter-relationships and that the modelling of the CTA had demonstrated that there was a cumulative impact from all development areas to all of the interventions. The Authority approved the draft supplementary guidance on 24 April 2015 and sent it to the Scottish Ministers for ratification.</p>

The Authority made that amendment and adopted the supplementary guidance (&#8220;SG&#8221;) on 25 June 2015.

It continued (in para 4.8): &#8220;[t]here will still be a requirement to mitigate impacts specific to the development (defined as local impacts) whether they are on the local or strategic network&#8221;. In section 5 the SG set out the contributions which were required to deliver the proposed interventions at an estimated cost of &#163;86.6m. In Table 1 in that section the SG set out contribution levels which for residential developments were fixed by reference to unit size, ranging from &#163;1,350 per unit for a one bedroom unit to &#163;3,148 per unit for a unit of five bedrooms or more. The table also provided for contributions from non-residential developments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Elsick appealed against the adoption of the SG to the Inner House of the Court of Session under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1997/8/section/238" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 238</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1997/8" uk:canonical="1997 c. 8" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1997 Act</ref>. On 29 April 2016 the First Division of the Inner House (The Lord President (Lord Carloway), Lord Menzies and Lord Drummond Young) allowed the appeal and quashed the SG: [2016] CSIH 28. The First Division upheld three of the four grounds of appeal which Elsick advanced. First, the court upheld the submission that the Authority had failed to comply with national policy on the use of planning obligations, holding that it was a fundamental principle of planning law, which was reflected in the Circular, that a condition attached to the grant of a planning permission, whether contained in a planning obligation or otherwise, must fairly and reasonably relate to the permitted development. The First Division accepted the distinction, which the reporter had drawn, between the sharing of costs among developments which had cumulatively required a particular investment in transport infrastructure on the one hand and the funding of a basket of measures, not all of which were relevant to every development. The court referred (in para 35 of its opinion) to the original Table 7.2 and held that many of the planned developments had no impact at all on several of the proposed infrastructure interventions. It added: &#8220;[t]his applies to both Elsick and Blackdog relative to a number of the interventions. In respect of others the impact is <span style="font-style:italic">de minimis</span>&#8221;. The result was that the additional sentence in the SG about complying with the guidance in the Circular, which was added at the request of the Scottish Ministers (para 11 above), could not prevent the obligation to contribute to the Fund, in which contributions were pooled, from breaching the Circular. The First Division also upheld Elsick&#8217;s submission that there was no rational basis for relying on Table 3 of Appendix 2 of the SG (ie the revised table 7.2 of the CTA) to support the contention that a particular intervention was made necessary by reason of either a particular development or the cumulative effect of it along with other developments.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">The Authority applied for and was given permission to appeal to this court arguing that the policy tests in the Circular were not part of the legal tests for the validity of a planning obligation, that the Inner House had taken an unduly restrictive approach to policy, and that the Authority had substantially complied with the Circular when the SG afforded the opportunity to a developer to make mitigation contributions to infrastructure wholly outside the Fund (para 5.4 of the SG, which is set out in para 13 above). This court refused to allow the Authority to argue that the Inner House had erred in law and fact in finding that many of the planned developments, such as Elsick and Blackdog, have no impact on some of the proposed interventions and, in the case of Elsick and Blackdog, the impact on some other interventions is de minimis, because that was a finding of fact, based on the original table 7.2 of the CTA, the contents of which were not disputed.</p>

To address this challenge I examine (i) the correct legal test as to the lawfulness of a planning condition, (ii) the correct legal test as to the lawfulness of a planning obligation, (iii) the role of a planning obligation in the decision to grant or refuse planning permission, and (iv) the boundary between questions of legality and questions of policy.</p>

The condition was that the development of the site could not commence until the road on the western boundary of the site had been closed by a road closure order which the Secretary of State would have to confirm. In the leading speech, Lord Keith of Kinkel (pp 66-67) accepted the three tests which I have stated in para 28 above and which have come to be associated with the <span style="font-style:italic">Newbury</span> case and held that the condition met the third test because it was not unreasonable to impose such a condition which was in the public interest and where there were reasonable prospects that a road closure order would be confirmed.</p>

Planning obligations are most commonly required in the context of an application for planning permission, but they are not confined to such circumstances and are available as a means of keeping land free from any development. It is not surprising therefore that there is no general legal requirement that there be a relationship to a permitted development.</p>

Lord Hoffmann (779D) summarised the case thus: &#8220;the only tests for the validity of a planning obligation outside the express terms of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/8/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> [of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/8" uk:canonical="1990 c. 8" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>] are that it must be for a planning purpose and not <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> unreasonable&#8221;. Thus beyond the restrictions implicit in the words of the section there are only the constraints of administrative law, which requires the planning authority to exercise its power to seek a planning obligation for a planning purpose: its exercise solely for a purpose unrelated to land use planning would be an abuse of power. Similarly, if a local planning authority acts unreasonably in the <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury </span>sense in requiring the undertaking of a planning obligation, the obligation may be reduced (nullified).

The financial contribution can be applied towards infrastructure necessitated by the cumulative effects of various developments, so long as the land which is subject to the planning obligation contributes to that cumulative effect and thereby creates a sufficient relationship between the obligation in question and the land so that one can fairly speak of the obligation as regulating the development of the land.</p>

Were such a restriction lawful, a planning authority could use a planning obligation in the context of an application for planning permission to extract from a developer benefits for the community which were wholly unconnected with the proposed development, thereby undermining the obligation on the planning authority to determine the application on its merits. Similarly, a developer could seek to obtain a planning permission by unilaterally undertaking a planning obligation not to develop its site until it had funded extraneous infrastructure or other community facilities unconnected with its development.

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">It is, perhaps, surprising that the legal boundaries of a planning obligation have not been the subject of more extensive judicial comment, beyond the cases discussed in <span style="font-style:italic">Good v Epping Forest District Council</span>, the comment by Beldam LJ in the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco</span> (para 43 above), and the opinion of Lord MacLean in <span style="font-style:italic">McIntosh v Aberdeenshire Council</span>1999 SLT 93 (which upheld the validity of a planning obligation to build an estate road to serve the owner&#8217;s development of his land and also to facilitate the development of neighbouring land in third party ownership) when the risk of misuse of<span style="font-weight:bold"/>planning obligations has long been recognised as a matter of policy. There were concerns that some planning authorities were tempted to make exorbitant demands for what has been called &#8220;planning gain&#8221;, to confer benefits on the community which were not part of the developer&#8217;s original proposal. A developer in order to obtain a planning permission might be forced to incur disproportionate costs in providing such gains which were unrelated or insufficiently related to its development or otherwise suffer the delay and expense of an appeal to the Scottish Ministers. This practice risked bringing the planning system into disrepute. In 1981, in a report to the Secretary of State for the Environment called &#8220;Planning Gain&#8221;, the Property Advisory Group advised that planning obligations be used only to overcome legitimate planning objections to an application for planning permission and that the practice of bargaining with developers for planning gain was unacceptable. The report, which was criticised for taking too narrow an approach to the planning process, advocated that the Secretary of State should issue guidance. The Department of the Environment and the Welsh Office produced such guidance in 1983 in circular 22/83, which sought to control rather than exclude the pursuit of planning gain. In Scotland, the Scottish Development Department issued a circular in 1984, entitled &#8220;<ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1972/52/section/50" uk:canonical="1972 c. 52 s. 50" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">Section 50</ref> Agreements&#8221; (SDD circular 22/1984). Current guidance on the use of planning obligations in Scotland is contained in the Circular (para 5 above). As I explain when addressing question (iv) below, this guidance, while an important statement of national policy, does not have the force of law.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">There was also a perceived risk that developers, who were each promoting a different site in a competition for what might be an exclusive permission to develop one of the sites, would offer to enter into an obligation with the planning authority to fund infrastructure or other community facilities which were unrelated or only marginally related to their developments. This practice similarly threatened to bring the planning system into disrepute, by creating the impression that they were buying planning permissions. In the heady days of the &#8220;store wars&#8221;, major supermarket chains competed with each other before planning authorities and in planning appeals to obtain permission to develop rival sites up and down the United Kingdom. This competition, which often involved offers to provide &#8220;planning gain&#8221;, led to authoritative judicial guidance on the relevance of a planning obligation to the grant or refusal of a planning permission, which I now consider under question (iii).</p>

The Witney local plan proposed a new link road, including a new river crossing, to relieve traffic congestion. Tesco entered into a planning obligation with the planning authority under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/8/section/106" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 106</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/8" uk:canonical="1990 c. 8" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref> to fund that road. The Secretary of State on appeal favoured the Tarmac site and refused permission to the Tesco application, holding that the link road was not needed to enable any of the food stores to be developed or so directly related to any of the developments or the use of the land after completion that any of the developments should not be permitted without it. Tesco appealed under <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/8/section/288" uk:canonical="" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">section 288</ref> of <ref href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/1990/8" uk:canonical="1990 c. 8" uk:origin="TNA" uk:type="legislation">the 1990 Act</ref>, arguing that the Secretary of State had erred in law in not treating the offer to fund in the planning obligation as a material consideration.

Thus, a green belt policy will be relevant to an application if the site of the application falls within the specified green belt and a requirement that a certain amount of open space is provided in a proposal for residential development will be relevant to an application for residential development. Similarly, a requirement in the plan that an applicant should agree to contribute to the cost of offsite infrastructure, which is related to its development, will be relevant to the application. But the words, which I have emphasised, mean that if a planning obligation, which is otherwise irrelevant to the planning application, is sought as a policy in the development plan, the policy seeking to impose such an obligation is an irrelevant consideration when the planning authority considers the application for planning permission.</p>

Thus, to use the example of the farmer with two farms, A and B. He wishes to develop farm A and is prepared to enter into a planning obligation to restrict the development or use of farm B in the context of his negotiation of a permission for farm A. The legality of the planning obligation in relation to farm B will depend, among other things, on whether it restricts or regulates the development or use of farm B. The relevance of the planning obligation to the determination of the application in relation to farm A depends upon there being a more than trivial connection between the benefit conferred by controlling farm B and the development of farm A, as the <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco</span> case decided.</p>

	    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.00in;text-indent:0.50in">Relevant ministerial guidance which sets out national planning policy is unquestionably a material consideration for any planning authority when it determines applications for planning permission. A failure by a planning authority to take into consideration national guidance, such as that in the Circular (para 5 above) on the tests which a planning authority should apply when deciding whether to seek a planning obligation, would be unlawful. Further, if a planning authority were to depart from national planning guidance when refusing an application for planning permission, it might risk an appeal by the disappointed applicant to the Scottish Ministers. But a decision by the planning authority is not illegal if it departs from ministerial guidance in a planning circular, provided that the authority has treated that guidance as a relevant consideration when it reached its decision.</p>

The former is a question of law; the latter is a matter for the planning judgement of the planning authority. Accordingly, a failure by a planning authority to have regard to relevant guidance as a material planning consideration would be an error of law. A decision, after considering the guidance, not to follow it, would (absent another ground of challenge in administrative law) be a matter of planning judgement, in which the courts have no role.</p>

It involves the pooling of the contributions and no one developer is liable for the costs of any of the specified interventions (paras 1.5 and 3.3 and Appendix 2). Secondly, the obligation to contribute to the Fund is in addition to the requirement that a developer mitigate impacts specific to its development (para 4.8). Thirdly, the contributions from residential developers are fixed at a sum per unit (Table 1 summarised in para 12 above). Fourthly, those payments are not tied to the impact of a particular development on the transport network. The original table 7.2 in the CTA suggested that there was no connection between traffic generated by certain developments and the need to intervene at particular hotspots. The revised table 7.2 which is referred to in para 7.3 of the SG and reproduced in Appendix 2 shows that some vehicles from each of the developments will use the proposed infrastructure but in many cases such use is at a very low level.</p>

The developer is still expected to provide a contribution towards the cumulative impact of the developments on infrastructure over and above the impact of its individual development and the paragraph understandably expresses doubt whether a developer could create the needed assessment, design and provide for the necessary mitigation measures. Unless a developer were able to perform this daunting task and persuade the planning authority that it was robust, it is clear that the scheme envisages that it would not obtain planning permission for its development.</p>

This is because the pooling of fixed per unit contributions towards the funding of infrastructure interventions, which include many on which a particular development&#8217;s impact is minimal, does not meet the criterion in the Circular that the obligation is fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind to the proposed development. The statement which the Scottish Ministers inserted into the SG therefore is no safeguard.</p>

It enables a planning authority to facilitate development within its area. Inclusion of such a scheme in a development plan allows a public debate during the statutory process of the approval of the plan. The scheme allows developers in the area to assess the viability of their proposed developments knowing the extent of their liability to the Fund before they spend large sums pursuing their applications.

The guidance in the Circular is simply a material consideration which the planning authority must take into account when deciding whether to grant planning permission.
