UKSC	Majority	AEL v Flight Centre UK Ltd.xml	Beginning	Judgment approved by the court for a hand downAEL v Flight Centre (UK) Ltd	The Respondent, did not appear and was not represented	The Employment Tribunal erred in failing to consider the application for reconsideration of the correct application for anonymity which the Appellant had made. The Appellant had made two relevant applications for anonymity – the first, dated 14 July 2021, was rejected by the Tribunal in a judgment dated 26 July 2021. The Appellant then made a further application on 4 August 2021 supported by a disability impact statement and medical records. That application was considered by the ET on 9 September 2021, by which point the Appellants claims against her former employer had been compromised. The 4 August 2021 application was rejected by the Tribunal under the terms of a decision issued on 9 September 2021. The Appellant applied for reconsideration of that decision on 17 September 2021. However, when that application was considered by the Tribunal under the terms of a decision issued on 21 March 2022, it was treated not as an application in respect of the decision issued on 9 September 2021 but as one made by reference to the earlier decision of 26 July 2021. To that extent therefore, it appeared that the ET had fallen into error	0.4602	0.4187	0.4602, 0.3931, 0.3628, 0.3484, 0.3463, 0.3445, 0.3367, 0.3322, 0.3310, 0.3303	8. Although the EAT has sought confirmation as to the position of the remaining claimants (whether appellants or respondents to this appeal), no representations have been made by them or on their behalf. The EAT has therefore proceeded on the assumption that they have not agreed to the proposed consent order and the hearing of the appeal remained in the list, to allow for the possibility that they might wish to be heard. In the event, none of the unrepresented claimants attended the hearing. (A Alston  Ors v The Doctors Laboratory Limited  Ors)	8. Although the EAT has sought confirmation as to the position of the remaining claimants (whether appellants or respondents to this appeal), no representations have been made by them or on their behalf. The EAT has therefore proceeded on the assumption that they have not agreed to the proposed consent order and the hearing of the appeal remained in the list, to allow for the possibility that they might wish to be heard. In the event, none of the unrepresented claimants attended the hearing.	A Alston  Ors v The Doctors Laboratory Limited  Ors	6. The Tribunal held a hearing on Friday 17 October 2025. Mr Peacock KC and Mr Temple of counsel appeared for the Authority. Mr Botsman, solicitor advocate and partner at Keystone Law appeared for Ancean. The Tribunal is grateful to them for their submissions and assistance.	Ancean Limited v The Financial Conduct Authority	26. The claimant was called to a meeting on 12 August 2020. She was not given advance notice of the purpose of the meeting. The tribunal concluded that the claimant gave a more accurate description of the meeting than the respondent’s witnesses. Mr Kelt started by referring to the claimant’s queries to Ms Shingleton about the scope of the finance review. The tribunal rejected the respondent’s contention that they had patiently offered the claimant the opportunity to ask any questions and that their intention was to use the meeting to draw up terms of reference for Ms Shingleton. The Employment Tribunal rejected the respondent’s evidence that the claimant was obstructive. The tribunal found, contrary to the respondent’s version of events, that the claimant was not unresponsive or sullen.	Artem Limited v K Edwins	2. The appeal came back before me on 31 January 2023 for re-making. On that occasion, the Respondent raised a new issue relating to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to determine the appeal. A supplementary skeleton argument was submitted by the Respondent in which she sought to argue that the Tribunal no longer had jurisdiction to decide the appeal as regulation 16 of the Immigration (European Economic Area) Regulations 2016 (“the EEA Regulations”) had not survived the revocation of the EEA Regulations after 31 December 2020. An issue was also raised about the Respondent’s preparedness for the hearing as the Respondent had not had sight of the Appellant’s bundle before the First-tier Tribunal.	Adekunle Oluwaseun Osunneye v Secretary of State for the Home Department	8. I do not recite all of the Claimant’s application, and I do not criticise its brevity. It was made pursuant to Rule 29 of the Employment Tribunals Rules of Procedure 2013 (ET Rules), as then in force. The application to add Mr Doe as a Respondent was explained in light of the First Respondent’s insolvency; the Claimant’s understanding that Mr Doe had full control over the First Respondent, with sole responsibility for the alleged discriminatory behaviour; and that the Claimant had only learnt of the financial status of the First respondent on 16 th January 2024 and had taken steps to make the application promptly. The application added that the Claimant was a litigant in person at the time of presenting his Claim Form and that it was not reasonable for him to have understood any necessity to have included Mr Doe as an additional Respondent.	C Mileham v Zeus Limestone Ltd TA Rovic Tiles In Creditors Voluntary Liquidation  Anor	56. Mr Bates had no instructions about the meeting in 2017 and there is no mention of it in the FTT’s decision, although the minutes were included in the hearing bundle. Throughout the hearing of the appeal Mr Bates fully discharged his professional obligations when appearing against a litigant in person and conscientiously presented all the arguments he could think of in favour of Mr Cox’s position. In the same spirit he suggested that it might be necessary to remit the application to the FTT for it to consider whether what was said at the meeting had any effect on the liability of the tenants who were present.	Anchor Hanover Group v Kenneth Cox	19. The employment tribunal held that during the claimant's absence Ms Caunt found that certain documents including references, DBS checks and training certificates had not been uploaded to the respondent’s systems. She told Mr Boardman that the claimant had misled him in saying that she had made progress at their previous meeting.	Alcedo Orange Limited v G FerridgeGunn	“39. But in this case it was an undisputed fact that the claimant had not looked or applied for any other jobs at all throughout the period from the date when she was dismissed up to the remedy hearing. The respondent was entitled to assert, and the tribunal to proceed, as it plainly did, on the basis, that that failure on her part amounted to a failure to mitigate her loss, because it was unreasonable for her not to look for, or apply for any jobs at all, unless the tribunal accepted that there was an explanation for that, of a kind that meant that it was, after all, not unreasonable. That is not a reversal of the burden of proof. Had it not been admitted, the respondent would have had to make good that there had been a failure to do something which was in principle unreasonable (in this case, the failure to apply for any jobs at all from the date of dismissal to the date of the remedy hearing); but it was able to make that good in this case, because it was not in dispute, and was admitted.	A  Anor v C Limited  Ors	8. In the event that further material comes to light, the remedy for an applicant is to make further submissions to the Respondent and not seek to place the Tribunal in the role of primary decision-maker.	Ali Akber R on the application of v Secretary of State for the Home Department	53. The process which is undertaken by the Respondent where Paragraph 353 applies is therefore as follows:	Ali Akber R on the application of v Secretary of State for the Home Department
UKSC	Majority	AEL v Flight Centre UK Ltd.xml	Middle	The response on behalf of the Attorney General came in a letter of 18 October 2023. The decision was made that the test for appointing an advocate to the appeal had not been met in that given the case law currently available relating to the making of anonymity order, there was “not a significant risk of an important and difficult point of law being determined without the court or tribunal hearing all relevant arguments.” The letter identified and summarised the key cases in this area as follows:	X v Y UKEAT/0302/18/RN – A rule 50 order can be made at any time, even where proceedings are substantially over. There may be good reasons for anonymisation under Rule 50 bearing in mind an individual’s Article 8 rights;	X v Y UKEAT/0302/18/RN – A rule 50 order can be made at any time, even where proceedings are substantially over. There may be good reasons for anonymisation under Rule 50 bearing in mind an individual’s Article 8 rights;	0.3583	0.2796	0.3583, 0.3280, 0.3229, 0.3208, 0.3085, 0.3062, 0.3037, 0.2975, 0.2906, 0.2897	(3) An application for an order under this rule- (a) must be supported by evidence; and (b) may be made without notice. (Abela and others v Baadarani)	(3) An application for an order under this rule- (a) must be supported by evidence; and (b) may be made without notice.	Abela and others v Baadarani	84. The claimant said that the application that she had made had raised matters to do with the intended hearing arrangements and attached sensitive medical evidence; and that, in the event, she had not pursued the application, as it proved unnecessary to do so. She invited me to direct remission to the same panel, if possible, on the basis of their familiarity with the case, having previously conducted a hearing over four days.	Blackdown Hill Management Limited  Anor v Anastasia Tuchkova	121. On the face of it, there appears to have been no material change of circumstances since the two earlier orders had been made, and no assertion by the Respondent that the earlier orders had been based on material omission or mistreatment, or some other substantive reason necessitating interference with them (see Serco Ltd v Wells [2016] ICR 768, EAT and related authority). If so, there was no judicial basis upon which the Tribunal could interfere with those earlier orders. I note, however, that, in addressing the Claimants’ application for costs at paragraph 8 of the reasons for its orders dated 22 July 2020, the Tribunal recorded, ‘In refusing the application, EJ Brown did not find that the application was a repetition of previous applications.’ In those circumstances, and as Employment Judge Brown had also heard one of the earlier applications (for which no written reasons had been requested), it is not possible for the EAT to be certain that the Serco principles were engaged, or, if engaged, infringed. In those circumstances, the Claimants’ contention of abuse of process is not established.	Kuwait Investment Office v Simon Hard	48. We respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeal about change of circumstances. The change fell to be measured by reference to what the Judge had been told at the hearing on 6 December 2019, namely that despite earlier evidence to the contrary, the Guarantee had not been provided and that, in the circumstances, counsel for FAAN did not consider that he could properly pursue an application for further time in which to provide it. And yet, a couple of hours later, no doubt to the considerable surprise of FAAN’s counsel, the Guarantee had arrived, and a copy had been handed over to AIC, so that AIC had already demanded payment by the time of the hearing on 13 December. The fact that there had been a failure to comply with the condition in the earlier order to provide the Guarantee was no part of any change of circumstances, since that breach had occurred long before 6 December and the Judge knew all about it. What had changed was that the earlier order for provision of the Guarantee had, late on 6 December, been complied with, albeit belatedly.	AIC Ltd v Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria	17. On 5 November 2019, the respondent filed summary grounds of defence. These submitted that, since the applicant’s removal had been deferred, the judicial review brought by him had been rendered academic. On 15 January 2020, the applicant filed and served a reply to the summary grounds. The applicant contended that his removal would render him non-compellable as a witness and thus materially impair the effectiveness of the pending coronial inquest and, thus, the discharge of the respondent’s procedural obligation under Article 2 of the ECHR.	Ahmed Lawal R on the application of v The Secretary of State for the Home Department	32. In Gavin Edmondson , the decision of the Court of Appeal in Meguerditchian was cited in argument in the Supreme Court: see [2018] 1 WLR 2052 , 2054. But no argument was advanced by the defendant that an equitable lien could not arise because there were no court proceedings in existence when the underlying claims were settled.	Bott  Co Solicitors Ltd v Ryanair DAC	32. The appellant’s representative in response submits that the Secretary of State is wrong: that the appellant’s claim before 9 February 2023 was identical to her claim after 9 February 2023, that once the 2023 Order was in force both claims should have been dealt with in accordance with the same legal principles which, by dint of that Order now represented the law from 30 August 2018 onwards. The appellant submits that Reilly v SSWP makes clear that sections 8 and 12 of the SSA 1998 do not prevent claims having to be decided in accordance with retrospectively effective legislation. The appellant submits that SD v SSWP cannot be relied on by the Secretary of State given that it has not been published and was not the subject of argument.	AET v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions	71. Third , even where a prima facie case exists, it does not automatically follow that the failure of a person to give evidence will result in material weight being given to that failure, in favour of the other party : see Brooke LJ’s P rinciple (4) at paragraph 65 above. As Hickinbottom LJ held more recently in R (Kuzmin) v GMC [2019] EWHC 2129 (Admin) , there may be a reasonable explanation for the fact that the individual has not given evidence; and there may be other circumstances which would make it unfair to draw such an inference. Although Cockerill J in Magdeev expressed the court’s role in terms of its discretion, it is perhaps more a matter of the court having to apply the “rule” unless it is satisfied there is a reason not to do so.	AB v The Secretary of State for the Home Department	18. However, in the submissions he made after the oral hearing before me, the appellant on the face of it has conceded the appeal. He does so on the basis that “previous Upper Tribunal cases render indirect discrimination under the Equality Act 2010 and Article 14 of the ECHR redundant, due to achieving a legitimate aim of reducing financial costs to administer equal payments between equally responsible and cost-bearing parents”.	CD v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions	12. As a result of my decision on the admission of evidence from EA, the Claimant argued for an adjournment to adduce her own medical evidence. The argument advanced was that it was relevant to the Claimant’s article 8 rights and a balance between her rights and that of EA. It appeared to me that this application should be refused. An adjournment would not be in accordance with the overriding objective to deal with cases in a proportionate and expeditious manner unless there were significant countervailing reasons as to equality of arms. The reason advanced as to the Claimant’s article 8 rights was never an aspect of the response to this application, only article 10 rights were relied upon. It was also the case that the Claimant did not know what aspect of any medical evidence might be weighed against that introduced by EA, for a comparison of their respective article 8 rights. It seemed to me on that basis this was an application for an adjournment based on speculation as to both the evidence itself and to its impact on any convention right implications, in circumstances where article 8 had not been advanced in argument initially. On that basis I considered that the weight to be given to an argument based on equality of arms was minimal. In consequence I refused the adjournment.	A v Choice Support formerly MCCH Ltd

Mr Forshaw argued in effect that the relevant decision in this case was the decision that the claim of indirect discrimination had failed and that he was seeking to challenge the tribunal’s determination (to use a neutral term) on the agency point so as to raise another ground for upholding that decision. He referred me to rule 1(3) of the ET Rules of Procedure which provides: An order or other decision of the Tribunal is either— (a) a “case management order”, being an order or decision of any kind in relation to the conduct of proceedings, not including the determination of any issue which would be the subject of a judgment; or (b) a “judgment”, being a decision, made at any stage of the proceedings (but not including a decision under rule 13 or 19), which finally determines— (i) a claim, or part of a claim, as regards liability, remedy or costs (including preparation time and wasted costs); (ii) any issue which is capable of finally disposing of any claim, or part of a claim, even if it does not necessarily do so (for example, an issue whether a claim should be struck out or a jurisdictional issue); (iii) the imposition of a financial penalty under section 12A of the Employment Tribunals Act.

The tribunal imposed an interim order withholding the information from everyone except AM’s legal representatives. That order could not be made under rule 14(2). Its purpose was to preserve the confidentiality of the representations until that rule could be considered. Doing otherwise would deprive rule 14(2) of any value or effect. The legal basis for the order was the tribunal’s general case management powers in rule 5.	AM v Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust  Anor	19. However, “proceedings” is not a defined term in the legislation, nor is it a term of art under the general law. Its meaning must depend on its statutory context and on the underlying purpose of the provision in which it appears, so far as that can be discerned. The context in which the word appears in section 46(3) of LASPO is different and so, in my judgment, is the result.	Plevin v Paragon Personal Finance Limited	(b) proceedings before the Tribunal;	Ancean Limited v The Financial Conduct Authority	143. This is all the more important in a case like this where a claimant, representing herself, brings a claim that includes complaints under multiple jurisdictions. The employment tribunal will attempt to bring clarity through case management and will endeavour to produce a definitive agreed list of issues for the final hearing. However, there can come a point, as in this case, where an Employment Judge quite properly concludes that attempting further particularisation will not be helpful and the case should proceed to a final hearing. That can present particular challenges for the employment tribunal charged with determining the case. It is all the more important, in such circumstances, that the EAT reads the whole judgment with that context in mind. Mr Stephenson has identified a number of areas where it may be that the claimant’s case could have been put or argued in a different way. However, the ET was entitled to determine the case as it was identified before it.	A v Carers Trust South East Wales	3. Proceedings before the EAT are governed by the EAT Rules , as amended. Directions about the practice and procedure of the EAT can be given by the Senior President of Tribunals and the President of the EAT (approved by the Senior President of Tribunals and the Lord Chancellor), albeit that, to the extent there is any difference between such a direction and the EAT Rules , the latter must take precedence. At the relevant time, the EAT Practice Direction 2018 (“EAT PD 2018”) was in force.	AB v The University of East London	58. Accordingly, if section 53 is to have the remarkable effect argued for by Mr Eadie QC for the Attorney General, it must be “crystal clear” from the wording of the FOIA 2000, and cannot be justified merely by “general or ambiguous words”. In my view, section 53 falls far short of being “crystal clear” in saying that a member of the executive can override the decision of a court because he disagrees with it. The only reference to a court or tribunal in the section is in subsection (4)(b) which provides that the time for issuing a certificate is to be effectively extended where an appeal is brought under section 57. It is accepted in these proceedings that that provision, coupled with the way that the tribunal’s powers are expressed in sections 57 and 58, has the effect of extending the power to issue a section 53 certificate to a decision notice issued or confirmed by a tribunal or confirmed by an appellate court or tribunal. But that is a very long way away indeed from making it “crystal clear” that that power can be implemented so as to enable a member of the executive effectively to reverse, or overrule, a decision of a court or a judicial tribunal, simply because he does not agree with it.	R on the application of Evans and another v Attorney General	(b) The legal proceedings	Republic of Mozambique acting through its Attorney General  v Privinvest Shipbuilding SAL Holding an	205. My provisional view is that the Tribunal may have jurisdiction to make declarations in proceedings generally (in references and appeals), even though there is no explicit power granted to the Tribunal within the TCEA or Tribunal Rules to do so nor is there any authority from the Tribunal or courts on the point. The Tribunal’s only explicit power under s.15(1)(c) TCEA is to make declarations in judicial review proceedings. Nonetheless the power may be implied by virtue of sections 3(5) and 25(2)(c) TCEA as the Authority submits. In any event, there is no need for me to consider the argument in further detail or reach a concluded view on the point. This is because I have decided it is not necessary nor proportionate to make a declaration in this case when I can make directions in response to the application in similar terms.

In a final affidavit the officer said that the new material did not relate to individuals “alleged to have any direct role in Mr Finucane’s murder”.

He then submitted reports to the PPS on his conclusions.

In the matter of an application by Geraldine Finucane for Judicial Review Northern Ireland	9. The present law, contained in sections 58 and 59 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 , an Act of the UK Parliament, and section 25(1) of the Criminal Justice Act (NI) 1945, an Act of the Northern Ireland legislature, does impose that obligation upon her, unless there is a risk to her life or of serious long-term or permanent injury to her physical or mental health. Indeed, it does more than that. It has, as the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has recently pointed out, a “chilling effect” upon clinicians, who are reluctant to discuss the options for fear of being thought to “aid, abet, counsel or procure” an abortion which might be unlawful. It also discourages women who have had abortions, lawful or unlawful, from seeking proper after-care, because of section 5 of the Criminal Law Act (NI) 1967: anyone who knows or believes that an offence has been committed and has information which might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension, prosecution, or conviction of the person who committed it, commits an offence if they fail without reasonable excuse to give that information to the police within a reasonable time. The Departmental Guidance for Health and Social Care Professionals on Termination of Pregnancy in Northern Ireland (March 2016) draws professionals’ attention to both these risks. The Royal Colleges of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, of Midwives and of Nursing described the 2013 draft as intimidating for women and for professionals and the CEDAW Committee found that the finalised Guidance “perpetuates such intimidation” (Report of the inquiry concerning the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland under article 8 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, CEDAW/C/OP.8/GBR/1, published 23 February 2018, para 18).

The investigations carried out by PSNI into the new material uncovered by Sir Desmond were described by Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy in three affidavits. In the first of these, in June 2016, he said that the Chief Constable had decided that that material should be examined to see whether it “provided any opportunities to progress the investigation into Mr Finucane’s murder”. An investigating officer was appointed to carry out that task. He concluded that there was no reason to review the decision of the PPS in 2007 (see para 30 above).

However, he states that given the factual overlap between the cases, there has been close and regular liaison between the teams, as would be expected, in order, amongst other things: (a) for the Authorisations team to draw upon the EMO team’s knowledge of events at SVS when assessing the actions of Mr Ewing in the context of Ancean’s application; (b) to identify, and obtain access to, relevant evidential material that was obtained during the Enforcement investigation; and (c) to ensure that each team is able to comply with the Authority’s respective disclosure obligations in each of the Ancean Reference and the Enforcement References.	Ancean Limited v The Financial Conduct Authority	46. The principal issue on this appeal is whether the current policy of the Director of Public Prosecutions (‘the Director’) relating to taking over and discontinuing private prosecutions is, as the Divisional Court held, lawful. I agree with that conclusion for the reasons given by Lord Wilson, but, in the light of the division of opinion in this court, I propose to set out my thinking.	R on the application of Gujra v Crown Prosecution Service	60. For the reasons that I have already given I do not believe that there will. I have, however, been considering thus far the position of expert witnesses in civil cases. I believe that my conclusions hold good in the case of the duty owed by an expert witness to the client who retains him in a criminal trial. I concede, however, that the risk of vexatious claims from those convicted of criminal offences may be greater. Such claims will, however, be struck out as an abuse of process unless the convicted client first succeeds in getting his conviction overturned on appeal – see Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police [1982] AC 529 .	Jones v Kaney	54. As to the policy justifying the provision, the policy memorandum explained that the Scottish Government disagreed with the Scottish Law Commission’s recommendation that there should be no restriction on the availability of the defence, and stated:	AB v Her Majestys Advocate	61. As to the conduct of private prosecutions, it is clear that there will be some prosecutions which the Director will take over in order to discontinue, and some which he will take over in order to conduct them himself. However, it is also apparent from the 2009 policy that there will be prosecutions which the Director will not take over, and will allow to proceed as private prosecutions, even if one ignores the prosecutions which the Director effectively leaves to large concerns – as described by Lord Wilson at para 33.

UKSC	Dissenting	A Reference by the Attorney General for Northern Ireland...xml	Middle	The Attorney General submits that a devolution issue arises because the provision of lists by the Department for Communities is necessary in order to give effect to the Secretary of State’s commencement orders. The Department refutes this, contending that its role in issuing the relevant lists amounts to nothing more than providing administrative support to the Secretary of State. The commencement orders define the relevant territories by reference to lists of postcodes issued by the Department. The lists were not prepared, however, pursuant to any statutory or other power and do not have any independent legal force or effect, the Department says. They are incorporated by reference into the commencement orders and therefore have legal effects solely by reason of the act of the Secretary of State, not the act of the Department.	6. Acts by the Secretary of State or by departments in Westminster do not come within the purview of section 24 of the 1998 Act. In order for a devolution issue to arise, therefore, it must be shown that an act has been carried out or a function has been discharged by a Northern Ireland Minister or a Northern Ireland department.

Suppose, for instance, that the Scottish Executive wanted to introduce legislation changing the system of accommodation for homeless persons in Scotland, but the reform would involve modifying provisions in a (reserved) Act on asylum seekers. If similar legislation had been proposed by the Scottish Office before devolution, the Scottish Office and the Home Office would have discussed the relevant policy issues. Eventually, the government as a whole would have reached a view on them and this view would have been reflected in the resulting legislation – if any.	Martin v Her Majestys Advocate Scotland	64. The recognition of foreign states, governments and heads of state is, under the constitutional arrangements in force within the United Kingdom, one element of the conduct of foreign relations which is entrusted to the executive and which is performed in large part pursuant to the royal prerogative.	Maduro Board of the Central Bank of Venezuela v Guaidó Board of the Central Bank of Venezuela	13. He went on to state at 1580 E to G The solution in any particular case where the question of state immunity arises at common law has to be one of the analysis of the particular facts against the whole context in which they have occurred . There is little if anything to be gained by trying to fit the case into a particular precedent or to devise categories of situations which may or may not fall on the one side of the line or the other. It is the nature and character of the activity on which the claim is based which has to be studied, rather than the motive or purpose of it. The solution will turn upon an assessment of the particular facts. The line between sovereign and non-sovereign state activities may sometimes be clear, but in other cases may well be difficult to draw.

Implied recognition is a concept of international law and its function on the international plane is widely acknowledged. However, there is no scope for the application of any notion of implied recognition by courts in this jurisdiction. In the present case, exceptionally, Her Majesty’s Government departed from its 1980 policy and made an express statement in relation to the status of a person claiming to be head of state of Venezuela. That statement must be interpreted and applied by the courts and is determinative. No question of implied recognition arises. Where there is no such express statement, Hobhouse J in Republic of Somalia v Woodhouse Drake & Carey (Suisse) SA and Mance J in Kuwait Airways Corpn v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5) have demonstrated that it is not open to the courts to infer recognition from the conduct of HMG. Quite apart from the practical difficulties of doing so, to infer the intention of HMG in relation to recognition would be to trespass into an area which is constitutionally within the exclusive competence of the executive. In such circumstances recognition ceases to be the determinative criterion and the court must identify who may be the government or head of state by making its own findings of fact as indicated in Republic of Somalia v Woodhouse Drake & Carey (Suisse) SA.’	Kuwait Investment Office v Simon Hard	(4) The Foreign Secretary also objects to the use of the terms in the Luther v Sagor sense as “not an ordinary or correct use of this term”. Nevertheless, he accepts that several cases have adopted “this alternative, lesser meaning”, referring to Bank of Ethiopia v National Bank of Egypt [1937] Ch 513 and Banco de Bilbao v Sancha [1938] 2 KB 176 . He submits that its application is limited to the specific and unusual situation where HMG chooses to recognise rival governments and he states that HMG has no modern practice of dual recognition of rival governments of the kind at issue in those cases.

Mr Laddie then turned to consider the one voice doctrine, observing that there was substantial agreement between the parties. First, in none of the authorities on which either party relied had there been any discussion as to whether the doctrine applied to missions, or parts thereof, with the possible exception of Khurts Bat (which concerned a special mission). Nevertheless, in the EAT, for current purposes, the Claimants accepted that the scope of the Crown Prerogative would extend to missions, as well as individuals, and that a principle akin to the one voice doctrine applied to a mission, or part of it. That being so, the Claimants further accepted that recognition was a question of fact, capable of conclusive resolution by a statement by HMG.	Kuwait Investment Office v Simon Hard	183. Quark concerned South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands (“SGSSI”), a British Overseas Territory acquired originally by settlement, with a constitution governed by an order in council, which provided for a Commissioner, who was, in similar fashion to the High Commissioner of the Malayan Federation, bound under section 5(1) to act “according to such instructions, if any, as Her Majesty may from time to time see fit to give him through a Secretary of State”. By the Fishing (Maritime Zone) Area Order 1993 and the Fisheries (Conservation and Management) Ordinance 1993, the Commissioner declared, and introduced a licensing scheme controlling fishing within, a maritime zone extending 200 nautical miles from SGSSI. He further appointed a Director of Fisheries who was under his direction. The Secretary of State instructed the Commissioner (who was in turn required to direct the Director) to give two fishing licences in a way which precluded the grant to the claimant of a renewed licence. The claimant relied on article 1 of Protocol 1 (“A1P1”) of the European Convention on Human Rights to claim damages. A1P1 had not been extended to SGSSI by any notification under article 56 of the Convention. The claimant failed. Lord Bingham, Lord Hoffmann and Lord Hope endorsed as one reason a submission (advanced as here by counsel for the Secretary of State) that the Queen must be treated as having given the instructions through the Secretary of State in right of SGSSI, rather than in right of the United Kingdom.	Keyu and others v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and another	46. The present case, however, is entirely different. In point of form, a statutory instrument embodying a Schedule 7 direction is legislation. But, as Megarry J observed in Bates v Lord Hailsham of St. Marylebone [1972] 1 WLR 1373 , the fact that an order takes the form of a statutory instrument is not decisive: “what is important is not its form but its nature, which is plainly legislative” (page 1378). The Treasury direction designating Bank Mellat under Schedule 7, paragraph 13, was not legislative in nature. There is a difference between the sovereign’s legislation and his commands. The one speaks generally and impersonally, the other specifically and to nominate persons. As David Hume pointed out in his Treatise of Human Nature (Book III, Part ii, sec 2-6), “all civil laws are general, and regard alone some essential circumstances of the case, without taking into consideration the characters, situations and connexions of the person concerned.” The Treasury direction in this case was a command. The relevant legislation and the whole legislative policy on which it was based, were contained in the Act itself. The direction, although made by statutory instrument, involved the application of a discretionary legislative power to Bank Mellat and IRISL and nothing else. It was as good an example as one could find of a measure targeted against identifiable individuals. Moreover, as I have pointed out in dealing with the Bank’s substantive complaints, it singled out Bank Mellat from other Iranian banks on account of the Bank’s conduct or, in Hume’s words, its “characteristics, situations and connexions”. It directly affected the Bank’s property and business assets. If the direction had not been required to be made by statutory instrument, there would have been every reason in the absence of any practical difficulties to say that the Treasury had a duty to give prior notice to the Bank and to hear what they had to say. In a case like this, is the position any different because a statutory instrument was involved? I think not. That was simply the form which the specific application of this particular legislation was required to take.	Bank Mellat v Her Majestys Treasury No 2

It is, I believe, important to recognise that the distinct prohibitions in section 24 are disjunctive. Thus, it is forbidden to make, confirm or approve any subordinate legislation, orto do any act, so far as the legislation or act is incompatible with any of the Convention rights. The section comprehends, therefore, not only the enactment of subordinate legislation but also acts which may be ancillary or even incidental to that enactment. On a theoretical or technical level, therefore, the compiling of lists of postcodes and providing them as a means of facilitating the introduction of the commencement orders is an act or the discharge of a function under paragraph 1(b) of Schedule 10 to the 1998 Act.	0.995		0.9950, 0.3746, 0.3470, 0.3461, 0.3458, 0.3412, 0.3402, 0.3325, 0.3313, 0.3285	10.

Mr Segal submitted it was trite law that interpretation of statutory provisions should be the same in both jurisdictions unless the statute provided otherwise. Reliance by the appellants upon McNeill was misconceived as it concerned the situation where an employee terminates his contract and discussed questions applicable to the law of contract, in which there were differences in Scots Law from that in England. In contrast the purpose of section 145 B was to protect article 11 rights which were identical on both sides of the border.	INEOS Infrastructure Grangemouth Limited v Jones  Ors	45. Clause 15.4 of the Asset Purchase Agreement can be taken to refer, as the Extra Division held in para 52, to claims in relation to products manufactured before the transaction was entered into. The clauses of the Service Agreement that are founded on perform the same function in relation to products manufactured after that date. Although the transaction can be regarded as proceeding in stages, it is unrealistic to treat it as divisible into a series of separate and unrelated compartments. The obligations undertaken by Inveresk were all designed to serve the same end, which was to preserve the value of the intellectual property rights and other assets acquired by Tullis Russell after the Completion Date. As for the payments to be made by Tullis Russell, the Services Fees payable under clause 3.1 of the Services Agreement were a counterpart of Inveresk’s obligation to perform the services referred to in the clause. But in my opinion their obligation to pay the sum of the Initial Consideration and the Additional Consideration to Inveresk was a counterpart of the performance by Inveresk of their obligations under both agreements.	Inveresk plc v Tullis Russell Papermakers Limited Scotland	95. Girvan LJ further noted that Part 5 of the 2002 Act had been enacted following case law such as In re Andrews . In the light of that case law it was to be inferred that in England and Wales and Northern Ireland express provision for the costs of interim receivers was considered unnecessary because of the standard receivership lien on the assets for the receiver’s costs. I respectfully disagree. In my opinion the regime set out in Part 5 of the 2002 Act is distinguishable in important respects from that in the other legislation discussed in the cases.	Gale and another v Serious Organised Crime Agency	369. As to cases which do not concern fatal foetal abnormality, I find myself in agreement with Lord Reed’s reasoning in relation to article 8. He has pointed out the similarity between the arguments advanced unsuccessfully in A, B and C v Ireland , and those relied upon in the present case. Although it is important to note that A, B and C did not concern the particular categories of pregnancy with which we are concerned, it persuades me that, in relation to pregnancies where the foetus has a non-fatal abnormality or has been conceived as the result of a sexual offence, I must bring myself to accept two related propositions. First, notwithstanding the widespread consensus (in Europe and internationally) in favour of more flexible abortion regimes, it must be accepted that there may be room for different moral viewpoints. Secondly, it must be accepted that the balance between the protection of the life of the unborn child, the interests of society, and the rights of the pregnant woman may be struck in different ways. In these circumstances, and given the difficulty identified by Lord Reed as to where to draw the line in accommodating the categories of case with which we have been concerned, as well as the current lack of certainty about what moral views are presently held by the population of Northern Ireland, I do not feel that it would be appropriate at this stage to express a positive conclusion that the legislation itself is incompatible with article 8. In so saying, I also have in mind that, as Lord Mance says at para 92 of his judgment, other factors can play a part, in addition to the legislation itself, in producing adverse treatment of which complaint may be made. He points out that where one is able to examine the specific circumstances that have arisen, the cause of the impugned treatment may, in some cases, prove to have been not the applicable legislation itself, but rather the way that it was (mis)understood or (mal)administered. That is one of the reasons why an abstract challenge to legislation presents such a difficulty. In such circumstances, alleviating the hardship of women in the categories of case that we have been asked to consider, may involve a combination of amending the law and taking practical steps to ensure that proper information and support is available to the women concerned, countering what Lord Kerr has described (para 176) as the “significant chilling effect” on women who wish to obtain an abortion and doctors who might assist them. Given the diverse circumstances covered by the categories upon which we have been asked to focus (as to which, see for example Lord Mance’s discussion of the position in relation to sexual crimes, commencing at para 127 of his judgment), the solutions require democratic debate.

The position is therefore that Goluchowski, in respect of both sentences of imprisonment passed on him, and Sas, in respect of the sentence the subject of EAW 3, were due to attend in prison without more as a result of court judgments, but defaulted. The EAWs in respect of these sentences could be based on these court judgments. Any domestic summonses or warrants seeking to secure their compliance with these judgments were irrelevant, and did not require mention in the EAWs under article 8.1(c). By the same token, they could not constitute warrants requiring mention under section 2(6) (c) of the 2003 Act .	Goluchowski v District Court in Elblag Poland	105. Taking head (i), in the present context, the interference was prescribed by law - the 1861 and 1945 Acts. I have already noted that this appeal is not about whether those Acts define sufficiently clearly the circumstances in which abortion is permitted. It is clear at least since the FPANI case that they exclude, as such and without more, abortion in the circumstances of foetal abnormality and of pregnancy due to rape or incest, with which this appeal is concerned. The next step, taking head (ii), is to identify and consider the legitimacy of the aim or objective of the legislative prohibition. In terms of article 8(2), the potentially relevant interests are the protection of health or morals, and, perhaps, if a foetus is treated as or equated with an “other”, the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. It is clear that there exists in Northern Ireland a considerable body of religious or moral opinion that places great weight on the interests of the unborn child and believes that, even in the situations in issue on this appeal, those interests deserve such protection as the present legislative prohibition affords. How much protection is actually achieved, when the possibility exists and is clearly taken up by many pregnant women of travelling abroad for an abortion, is however very doubtful. The likelihood is that it is only a few women who are not sufficiently informed or sufficiently funded and organised who miss out on this possibility.	In the matter of an application by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for Judicial Review	353. In the light of the European court’s relatively recent judgment in A, B and C , it appears to me to be impossible to hold that the legislation in force in Northern Ireland is incompatible with article 3. In that regard, I again agree with the reasoning of Lord Mance. As he states, even when one takes into account that the present case focuses on pregnancies where the foetus is abnormal or has been conceived as the result of a sexual offence, it is apparent that the great majority of Northern Irish women wishing to terminate their pregnancy in such circumstances are able to do so by travelling elsewhere. The consequences are similar to those with which A, B and C was concerned, and do not meet the threshold for a violation of article 3.

Choudhury P helpfully summarised the relevant authorities in Forbes v LHR Airport Ltd [2019] ICR 1558 : In the course of employment 16. Several cases have dealt with the issue of whether alleged acts can be said to be “in the course of employment”. The leading authority is still the decision of the Court of Appeal in Jones v Tower Boot Co Ltd [1997] ICR 254 . In that case, the employer had argued that it should not be liable for serious acts of harassment by white employees against a black co-worker on the grounds that those acts were not done in the course of employment within the meaning of the then relevant provision under section 32(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976 . 17. The Employment Appeal Tribunal had overturned the tribunal’s decision that the acts were done in the course of employment on the basis that the phrase, “in the course of employment”, had a well-established meaning in law derived from the law of tort, under which an important consideration was whether an unauthorised wrongful act of an employee was so connected with that which he was employed to do as to be a mode of doing it. The appeal tribunal considered that by no stretch of the imagination could the acts in that case, which included deliberate branding with a hot screwdriver and whipping, be described as an improper mode of performing authorised tasks. 18. The Court of Appeal overturned the decision of the appeal tribunal and restored that of the employment tribunal. In doing so, it held that the relevant provisions of the anti-discrimination legislation should be given a broad interpretation and that it would be inconsistent with that approach to allow the concept of an act being done in the course of employment to be construed in any sense more limited than the natural meaning of those everyday words would allow. Waite LJ held as follows, at p 265: “The tribunals are free, and are indeed bound, to interpret the ordinary, and readily understandable, words ‘in the course of employment’ in the sense in which every layman would understand them. This is not to say that when it comes to applying them to the infinite variety of circumstance which is liable to occur in particular instances—within or without the workplace, in or out of uniform, in or out of rest-breaks—all laymen would necessarily agree as to the result. That is what makes their application so well suited to decision by an industrial jury. The application of the phrase will be a question of fact for each industrial tribunal to resolve, in the light of the circumstances presented to it, with a mind unclouded by any parallels sought to be drawn from the law of vicarious liability in tort.” 19. In Waters v Comr of Police of the Metropolis [1997] ICR 1073 the Court of Appeal had to consider whether a sexual assault, committed by a male police officer (“T”) against a female colleague at a police section house where she had a room and when both were off-duty, amounted to an act committed by T in the course of employment. The tribunal held that the conduct was not done in the course of employment. The appeal tribunal agreed. Waite LJ in the Court of Appeal dismissing the claimant’s appeal held as follows, at p 1095: “T and the applicant were off-duty at the time of the alleged offence. He lived elsewhere and was a visitor to her room in the section house at the time and in circumstances which placed him and her in no different position from that which would have applied if they had been social acquaintances only with no working connection at all. In those circumstances, it is inconceivable in my view that any tribunal applying the test in the Tower Boot case could find that the alleged assault was committed in the course of T’s employment. This ground of appeal therefore fails.” 20. The next authority dealing with the issue is Chief Constable of Lincolnshire Police v Stubbs [1999] ICR 547 . In that case a female police officer was sexually harassed by a male colleague at a pub where officers had gathered socially after the conclusion of their duties. The tribunal considered that the social gathering was closely connected to work and that the male officer’s conduct was done in the course of employment. The appeal tribunal, the then President, Morison J, presiding, upheld the decision stating, at pp 557–558: “We turn to the second point. We also reject Mr Bowers’s submissions on the proper interpretation of ‘course of his employment.’ We concur with the findings of the industrial tribunal, that the two incidents referred to, although ‘social events’ away from the police station, were extensions of the work place. Both incidents were social gatherings involving officers either immediately after work or for an organised leaving party. They come within the definition of course of employment, as recently interpreted by the Court of Appeal in Jones v Tower Boot Co Ltd [1997] ICR 254 and Waters v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1997] ICR 1073 . It would have been different as it seems to us had the discriminatory acts occurred during a chance meeting between Detective Sergeant Walker and the applicant at a supermarket, for example, but, when there is a social gathering of work colleagues such as there was in this case, it is entirely appropriate for the tribunal to consider whether or not the circumstances show that what was occurring was an extension of their employment. It seems to us that each case will depend upon its own facts. The borderline may be difficult to find. It is a question of the good exercise of judgment by an industrial jury. Whether a person is or is not on duty, and whether or not the conduct occurred on the employer’s premises, are but two of the factors which will need to be considered.” 21. In another decision of the appeal tribunal, Prison Service v Davis (unreported) 29 March 2000 , the then President, Lindsay J, considered that a sexual assault by a male prison officer against a female colleague could not, just because a clause in the employer’s code of conduct required employees not to do anything whilst on or off-duty that could bring discredit on the Prison Service, be regarded as conduct in the course of employment. The tribunal accepted a submission that such a clause cannot bring within the course of employment all acts done by employees when off-duty. 22. It was also argued by the claimant in that case that the fact that the employer had taken action after the incident in supporting the victim and in disciplining the male officer meant that it had impliedly accepted responsibility for dealing with the situation and that that supported the contention that the male officer’s conduct was in the course of employment. As to that contention Lindsay J said, at para 17: “But again, that is a matter that arose after the event. It is hard to see how the question of whether, at an earlier point, Mr Randall was acting within or without the course of his employment can be affected by how the employer responded thereafter.” The appeal tribunal reiterated that the application of the phrase “in the course of employment” will be a question of fact for each tribunal to resolve in the light of the circumstances presented to it. 23. The next authority to consider is that of Sidhu v Aerospace Composite Technology Ltd [2001] ICR 167 . In that case, Mr Sidhu was subject to racial abuse by a white colleague at a family day out at a theme park where that family day out had been organised by the employer. The tribunal dismissed Mr Sidhu’s contention that this was conduct in the course of employment, notwithstanding the fact that the employers had organised the event at which the conduct had occurred. The tribunal regarded as significant that the day out was not in the place of employment but at a public theme park; that everyone was there in their own time, not during working hours, and that the majority of the participants were friends and family rather than employees. 24. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the employment tribunal. Gibson LJ said, at para 28: “Mr Gill further argued that on the facts the tribunal should have found that the day out was ‘in the course of employment’. He pointed to the fact that disciplinary proceedings had been initiated against Mr Smith and Mr Sidhu. He referred to Chief Constable of Lincolnshire Police v Stubbs [1999] ICR 547 , in which the appeal tribunal upheld the decision of a tribunal that a social gathering of work colleagues, at which a woman police constable had been subjected to inappropriate sexual behaviour by a policeman, was an extension of their employment. But the appeal tribunal there stressed that each case would depend on its own facts, calling for the good exercise of judgment by an industrial jury. I recognise that another tribunal could properly have reached the conclusion that the incident on the day out was in the course of employment. But in my judgment, it is quite impossible to say that no tribunal could have reached the conclusion which the majority did on this point.” 25. From these authorities, it can be seen that the main principle to be gleaned is that the question of whether conduct is or is not in the course of employment within the meaning of section 109 of the Equality Act 2010 is very much one of fact to be determined by the tribunal having regard to all the relevant circumstances . It can also be said that the words “in the course of employment” are to be construed in the sense in which the lay person would understand them and that there is no clear dividing line between conduct that is in the course of employment and that which is not. Each case will depend on its own particular facts. 26. It is also apparent from these authorities that the relevant factors to be taken into account might include whether the impugned act was done at work or outside of work, and, if done outside of work, whether there is nevertheless a sufficient nexus or connection with work such as to render it in the course of employment . Those kinds of factors are readily understood when one is dealing with the physical environment of the workplace. It is much more difficult to apply them to the virtual landscape in which many people these days spend their time. Thus, it may not be very easy to say whether a person is doing something whilst at work where some of that person’s work activity is conducted online at home. Equally, it may be very difficult to ascertain whether there is a sufficient nexus between an activity carried out on a personal social media account and their employment. If that account is used for purposes relating to work then it might well be open to the tribunal to consider that there is a sufficient connection with work to render an act done on that social media account as being done in the course of employment; whereas if the link with work is tangential or more tenuous then it might well be open to the tribunal to conclude otherwise. 27. We do not consider that it is possible or even desirable to lay down any hard and fast guidance in respect of these matters, especially as the extent to which social media platforms are used continues to increase. Just as is the case with the physical work environment, whether something is done in the course of employment when done in the virtual landscape will be a question of fact for the tribunal in each case having regard to all the circumstances. No clear boundary as to when such conduct will be in the course of employment can be defined. [emphasis added] (AB v Grafters Group Ltd ta CSI Catering Services International)	12. Choudhury P helpfully summarised the relevant authorities in Forbes v LHR Airport Ltd [2019] ICR 1558 : In the course of employment 16. Several cases have dealt with the issue of whether alleged acts can be said to be “in the course of employment”. The leading authority is still the decision of the Court of Appeal in Jones v Tower Boot Co Ltd [1997] ICR 254 . In that case, the employer had argued that it should not be liable for serious acts of harassment by white employees against a black co-worker on the grounds that those acts were not done in the course of employment within the meaning of the then relevant provision under section 32(1) of the Race Relations Act 1976 . 17. The Employment Appeal Tribunal had overturned the tribunal’s decision that the acts were done in the course of employment on the basis that the phrase, “in the course of employment”, had a well-established meaning in law derived from the law of tort, under which an important consideration was whether an unauthorised wrongful act of an employee was so connected with that which he was employed to do as to be a mode of doing it. The appeal tribunal considered that by no stretch of the imagination could the acts in that case, which included deliberate branding with a hot screwdriver and whipping, be described as an improper mode of performing authorised tasks. 18. The Court of Appeal overturned the decision of the appeal tribunal and restored that of the employment tribunal. In doing so, it held that the relevant provisions of the anti-discrimination legislation should be given a broad interpretation and that it would be inconsistent with that approach to allow the concept of an act being done in the course of employment to be construed in any sense more limited than the natural meaning of those everyday words would allow. Waite LJ held as follows, at p 265: “The tribunals are free, and are indeed bound, to interpret the ordinary, and readily understandable, words ‘in the course of employment’ in the sense in which every layman would understand them. This is not to say that when it comes to applying them to the infinite variety of circumstance which is liable to occur in particular instances—within or without the workplace, in or out of uniform, in or out of rest-breaks—all laymen would necessarily agree as to the result. That is what makes their application so well suited to decision by an industrial jury. The application of the phrase will be a question of fact for each industrial tribunal to resolve, in the light of the circumstances presented to it, with a mind unclouded by any parallels sought to be drawn from the law of vicarious liability in tort.” 19. In Waters v Comr of Police of the Metropolis [1997] ICR 1073 the Court of Appeal had to consider whether a sexual assault, committed by a male police officer (“T”) against a female colleague at a police section house where she had a room and when both were off-duty, amounted to an act committed by T in the course of employment. The tribunal held that the conduct was not done in the course of employment. The appeal tribunal agreed. Waite LJ in the Court of Appeal dismissing the claimant’s appeal held as follows, at p 1095: “T and the applicant were off-duty at the time of the alleged offence. He lived elsewhere and was a visitor to her room in the section house at the time and in circumstances which placed him and her in no different position from that which would have applied if they had been social acquaintances only with no working connection at all. In those circumstances, it is inconceivable in my view that any tribunal applying the test in the Tower Boot case could find that the alleged assault was committed in the course of T’s employment. This ground of appeal therefore fails.” 20. The next authority dealing with the issue is Chief Constable of Lincolnshire Police v Stubbs [1999] ICR 547 . In that case a female police officer was sexually harassed by a male colleague at a pub where officers had gathered socially after the conclusion of their duties. The tribunal considered that the social gathering was closely connected to work and that the male officer’s conduct was done in the course of employment. The appeal tribunal, the then President, Morison J, presiding, upheld the decision stating, at pp 557–558: “We turn to the second point. We also reject Mr Bowers’s submissions on the proper interpretation of ‘course of his employment.’ We concur with the findings of the industrial tribunal, that the two incidents referred to, although ‘social events’ away from the police station, were extensions of the work place. Both incidents were social gatherings involving officers either immediately after work or for an organised leaving party. They come within the definition of course of employment, as recently interpreted by the Court of Appeal in Jones v Tower Boot Co Ltd [1997] ICR 254 and Waters v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis [1997] ICR 1073 . It would have been different as it seems to us had the discriminatory acts occurred during a chance meeting between Detective Sergeant Walker and the applicant at a supermarket, for example, but, when there is a social gathering of work colleagues such as there was in this case, it is entirely appropriate for the tribunal to consider whether or not the circumstances show that what was occurring was an extension of their employment.

Employment Tribunals regularly determine multiple complaints to which different legal tests apply. Employment Tribunals have to ensure that their findings of fact are consistent throughout.	Artem Limited v K Edwins	32. It was wrong to hold that the requests were too widely drawn and that to comply with them would involve disproportionate time and expense. As for the furlough-disclosure requests, these related not to 123 but to 6 employees. The documents were likely to be held electronically and the disclosure exercise should be easy. The mis-selling requests focussed on: the actions of 6 employees, in relation to requests 7 and 8; the communications of one person, the second respondent, in relation to requests 9 and 10; and a single email in relation to request 11. Even if it might be said that some of the requests were too wide, the judge was wrong not to consider them, category by category, and whether she should at least make an order in respect of some limited and specific categories or sub-categories of documents sought.	A Dodd v UK Direct Solutions Limited  Anor	32. An additional support for a wide construction to Part II is the wording of section 27 itself, in which wages are defined in broad and inclusive language, as “any sums payable to the worker in connection with his employment…whether payable under his contract or otherwise”. In Delaney v Staples [1992] 1 AC 687 , which the parties agreed I should look at for the purpose of this appeal even though neither referred to it, Lord Browne-Wilkinson described the words “in connection with employment” as “very wide”: 694H.	Abellio East Midland Trains Ltd v K Thomas	“82. Although the decision in McMenemy does not bind us as a matter of law, we consider there is a compelling case for not departing from what has been acknowledged to be good practice, whereby the EAT - which has a Britain-wide jurisdiction - should ordinarily follow relevant decisions of higher Courts within Great Britain, notwithstanding that the doctrine of precedent would not normally apply. Where, as here, the decision in question relates to a legislative protection that extends throughout Great Britain, and where there is no separate question as to the application of Scottish law, or the law of England and Wales, there is a legitimate public interest in consistency of approach. The fact that the issue raised by the present appeal has come before us by way of an appeal from an English ET is a matter of chance; as the case-law makes clear, this is an issue that has arisen (not infrequently) in cases both north and south of the England/Scotland border. In these circumstances, we consider that the appropriate course is to approach this appeal on the basis that the decision in McMenemy is binding upon us.	J Mireku v London Underground Limited	33. Thus, while the individual must be or have been a “worker” within the meaning of section 230 ERA and so have a contractual relationship to bring a claim in the first place, the source of the payment itself need not be contractual. In New Century Cleaning v Church [2000] IRLR 27 , a majority of the Court of Appeal (Morritt LJ and Beldam LJ) held that words “payable” in section 27, and “properly payable” in section 13 connoted a legal entitlement to the payment but were not restricted to contractual entitlements (Morritt LJ at [43], Beldam LJ at [62]). An example in this category are the sums due as payments for annual leave under the Working Time Regulations 1998 , which arise by virtue of the regulations rather than contract, and which were held in Stringer to fall within the definition of wages in s.27. In New Century , Beldam LJ at [62] gave the examples of a minimum wage ordered by a wage council or customary payments due under collective agreements. With respect, it is not clear he was correct on this. Under the Wage Council Act 1979 , for example, a wage council order had the effect of modifying the worker’s contract if it provided for payment of less than the statutory minimum (see section 15); and a collective agreement is generally not enforceable between the collective parties, so that the only means of payments giving rise to a legal entitlement is via the conduit of the individual contract of employment.	Abellio East Midland Trains Ltd v K Thomas	29. Sections 39 and 18 of the Equality Act provide so far as is relevant: 39 Employees and applicants … (2) An employer (A) must not discriminate against an employee of A's (B)— … (c) by dismissing B; … 18 Pregnancy and maternity discrimination: work cases (1) This section has effect for the purposes of the application of Part 5 (work) to the protected characteristic of pregnancy and maternity. (2) A person (A) discriminates against a woman if, in the protected period in relation to a pregnancy of hers, A treats her unfavourably — (a) because of the pregnancy, or (b) because of illness suffered by her as a result of it. … (6) The protected period, in relation to a woman's pregnancy, begins when the pregnancy begins, and ends— (a) if she has the right to ordinary and additional maternity leave, at the end of the additional maternity leave period or (if earlier) when she returns to work after the pregnancy; (b) if she does not have that right, at the end of the period of 2 weeks beginning with the end of the pregnancy. …	Alcedo Orange Limited v G FerridgeGunn	27. She noted that the £1,000 maximum leaves open the possibility of a total sum greater than £1,000, because an award may be made under Rule 39(1) in respect of “any specific allegation or argument”, and there may be more than one of those ( Wright v Nipponkoa Insurance at para 77). She therefore suggested that, in addition to the check based on affordability, there should be a final check based on proportionality (which is not a check required by the words of Rule 39 itself). See Wright v Nipponkoa Insurance at para 78:- “It is right that (…) the Employment Tribunal Rules 2013 may well result in separate awards being made in relation to different allegations and that this might give rise to a total level of award of some significantly higher value than the individual orders. When making such deposit orders Employment Tribunals should indeed stand back and look at the total sum awarded and consider the question of proportionality before finalising the orders made.”	Addison Lee v H Afshar  Ors	46. I return to the cases of Rothwell and Cartledge . Although other authorities were cited, including some relating to claims for damage to property, I have found them of little direct, or even indirect, assistance and therefore, like Jay J and the Court of Appeal, my focus has been upon these two central cases.	Dryden and others v Johnson Matthey Plc	28. However, she was not thereby writing additional words into Rule 39, or giving anything more than guidance. Standing back and looking at the total sum awarded is a matter of good sense and good judgment, consistent with the making of a deposit order being the exercise of a discretion. This is clear from the remainder of the passage in which Judge Eady both accepted the Employment Judge’s reference to what was “appropriate” rather than what was “proportionate”, and emphasised, also, the importance of the Employment Judge’s discretion. She said (at para 78 of Wright v Nipponkoa Insurance ):- “In this case, however, I am satisfied that the Employment Judge did. He expressly had regard to what he described as “appropriate”. In this case, it is clear that this was a reference to what was proportionate. The Employment Judge expressly had regard to the totality of the award made as comprised of each deposit order, allowing for the maximum that could be awarded under the Rules. He did not make the maximum awards that he could have done but made orders which gave rise to a total sum that seemed to be proportionate – “appropriate” – when taking into account the number of allegations to which the orders related and the Claimant’s means. That was a proportionate view on the totality of the award and a conclusion that was entirely open to the Employment Judge as an exercise of his discretion.”	Addison Lee v H Afshar  Ors

Ground (a) complains that the tribunal erred because it failed to determine the claimant’s complaint that the failure to respond at all to the third SAR (raised in May 2022) amounted to detrimental treatment on grounds of protected disclosures.  As I have recorded, the claimant was permitted to add that complaint, by amendment, in the Beyzade reconsideration decision.  However, the Gidney tribunal did not address it in their decision.  The claimant raised this omission in his reconsideration application, but the Gidney reconsideration decision also failed to address it.  I conclude that the Gidney tribunal did err by failing to determine this complaint, an error which was not remedied upon reconsideration.  I therefore uphold this ground.

The fourth chapter in the history was a reserved judgment and reasons sent to the parties on 14 June 2023 (EJ Goodman and members). It followed the Claimant’s successful appeal to the EAT against the judgment of the EJ Gordon tribunal, the protected disclosure claims being remitted to a new tribunal, and a later tribunal decision holding that the Claimant had made two protected disclosures. Although the issue for the EJ Goodman tribunal was whether the Claimant had been subject to a detriment because of those disclosures, the tribunal made some further findings of fact about the billing of client A: see reasons at §§40-52. Some of these findings were referred to in the judgment subject to this appeal. (Alastair Dobbie v Paula Felton ta Feltons Solicitors)	22.

Section 48(1) gives a worker the right not to be subject to a detriment by any act, or any deliberate failure to act, by his employer, done on the ground that the worker has made a protected disclosure. Section 48(2) provides that, on such a complaint, it is for the employer to show the ground on which any act, or deliberate failure to act was done. As noted, it was common ground that any qualifying disclosure made by the claimant to the first respondent would be a protected disclosure, and any detrimental treatment of her by the first respondent would be within scope of section 48(1).	A McDermott v Sellafield Ltd  Ors	39. In this case, submitted Professor Sarooshi, the Claimants are at liberty to advance such factual case as they choose, without first needing to set it out, meaning that there is also no pleaded response to that case, which might narrow the issues to which disclosure and the evidence need go. Despite that, orders had been made for disclosure of sensitive material. When considering whether the Tribunal had erred in its approach, the test to be applied was that set out in Noorani v Merseyside TEC Ltd [1999] IRLR 184, CA [32]: ‘Such decisions are, essentially, challengeable only on what loosely may be called Wednesbury grounds, when the court at first instance exercised the discretion under a mistake of law, or disregard of principle, or under a misapprehension as to the facts, where they took into account irrelevant matters or failed to take into account relevant matters, or where the conclusion reached was “outside the generous and it within which a reasonable disagreement is possible”…’ Applying that test, submitted Professor Sarooshi, the Tribunal’s decision had been flawed, in particular given the need to give proper effect to immunities, and the EAT ought to consider the application afresh and grant it.	Kuwait Investment Office v Simon Hard	7. The procedural issue is concerned with the way the tribunal dealt with the disclosure of V’s representations.	AM v Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust  Anor	2. There are two issues in this appeal. The first relates to disclosure of information to AM and others. That is a matter of procedure, although it may have had an impact on the tribunal’s decision. The second relates to the tribunal’s decision on the conditions of AM’s discharge. That is a matter of substance.	AM v Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust  Anor	22. Disclosure 4 related to an employee, CL, who had been on long-term sick leave since May 2018 with mental health issues, and who had previously had lengthy absences because of certain physical ailments, and who the tribunal said would almost certainly have met the definition of someone with a disability. The disclosure was said to arise from a colleague expressing a concern to the claimant about his well-being, leading to the claimant speaking to a member of the HR team, L Bowen, about him. The tribunal said of this: “122. The Claimant has alleged that she urged L Bowen “to take prompt and meaningful action to investigate how the HR team had allowed the situation to develop.” In her oral evidence she now puts the case no higher than that she urged L Bowen to “explore” whether all that could be done to assist CL was being done. 123. L Bowen was not CL’s line manager and so was not directly responsible for managing his absence, that would have been CB. The Claimant said that she nonetheless approached L Bowen about the issue because she was the person with whom she had an existing relationship, not CB. She acknowledged that she believed L Bowen did care about CL, and that she believed her when she said she was aware of the problem already and that she would look into it. 124. The Claimant has originally maintained that she spoke to L Bowen on 2nd October 2018. She has now amended that account to say that it was raised in the course of the one-to-one that she conducted with L Bowen on 1st October 2018, as part of the “Facilitated Feedback Sessions”. There is again, of course, no note of that discussion and it is somewhat implausible that the Claimant should have used that time for an entirely different purpose to that for which the meeting was scheduled. 125. On balance we prefer the recollection of L Bowen, as now expressed in the course of her oral evidence, that there was a very brief encounter in the corridor where the Claimant mentioned the situation with CL.”	A McDermott v Sellafield Ltd  Ors	122. Professor Sarooshi did not advance ground 3 with any force. Mr Laddie is right to observe that the EAT should not lightly overturn an employment tribunal’s assessment of the relevance of disclosure sought and ordered, assuming that it has directed itself in accordance with the applicable legal principles.	Kuwait Investment Office v Simon Hard	100. However, a complicating factor is that much of the detail of the claimant’s case in this regard came not in her amended particulars of claim, but in the July correspondence and application; and I note that this drew further detail from the respondents’ solicitors in their reply to it. However, I consider that the tribunal should, rather than entirely rejecting these requests, have given further consideration, in light of the correspondence, to what was now factually agreed and where the area of factual dispute about the foregoing aspects now lay, or any further steps needed to clarify that, and to whether the making of some disclosure order, in some more limited version of requests 1, 5 and/or 6, was appropriate.	A Dodd v UK Direct Solutions Limited  Anor	119. In my judgment, these grounds of appeal lack merit, for the following reasons: 119.1. State immunity was pleaded by the Respondent as a defence to the Claimants’ substantive claims. There is no suggestion that the Claimants’ response to that defence ought to have been anticipated in the claim forms, as originally pleaded; 119.2. It is routine in employment tribunal litigation for a claimant to advance a positive case in response to a pleaded defence without the prior need to amend his/her claim form, or to serve subsequent pleadings or particulars. The Claimants have noted certain commonplace examples; 119.3. Consistent with that fact, there is no express provision in the 2013 Rules for the service of pleadings subsequent to the response form; 119.4. This is not a case in which amendment of the claim form would have been appropriate; there was no change to the claims being advanced by the Claimants, or the bases upon which they were being advanced. Chandhok v Tirkey was a case relating to the bases upon which a claim of discrimination had been advanced. Unsurprisingly, the EAT observed that the function of the form ET1 is to set out a claimant’s essential case, to which the Respondent must respond in its form ET3, and which would be of significance, in particular, to the applicable limitation period. That is not this case. In relation to an application made for disclosure in civil proceedings, the Court of Appeal in Harrods Ltd v Times Newspapers [12] stated that it was essential that a court, first, identify the factual issues which would arise for decision at trial and that disclosure must be limited to documents relevant to those issues. As a proposition, that is uncontroversial, but it does not advance the Respondent’s position in this case, in which it is clear that the plea of state immunity is contested and the Respondent is put to proof of each matter on which it relies for its plea, including the facts which were said to be common ground in Sarrio . That was made clear by the First Claimant’s solicitors’ letter, dated 23 October 2019, and the Second Claimant’s solicitors’ letter, dated 19 December 2019. In so far as the specific disclosure sought related to particular factual matters in issue, those matters were identified in the Claimant’s respective application letters and in the inter partes correspondence which preceded them. 119.5. The pleaded averment appearing in the First (though not the former Second) Claimant’s case which is said to be inconsistent with the position adopted by the Claimants in relation to disclosure, is at paragraph 11 of his grounds of complaint: ‘The [Respondent] manages funds which are beneficially and wholly owned by the State of Kuwait’ . That is hardly determinative of the position, nor, on its face, advanced as an exhaustive or exclusive description of the Respondent’s activities. 119.6. The Respondent can derive no assistance, for current purposes, from the asserted burden of proof in relation to state immunity, which is contested, and, thus, an issue for determination by the tribunal at the substantive preliminary hearing. In such circumstances, the Respondent’s position on that issue in connection with its application to debar (as recorded in shorthand by the Tribunal at paragraph 15 of its decision, and clarified at paragraph 3 of the reasons for its orders dated 22 July 2020, in response to the Respondent’s application for reconsideration) was correct. 119.7. As no amendment to the Claimants’ pleaded case, or service of a further pleading, was required, the Tribunal made no error of law in proceeding to consider the Claimants’ application for specific disclosure in their absence. Furthermore, the Tribunal went on to give perfectly sensible case management directions which will ensure that, so far as its objection extends beyond the forensic, the Respondent will not be prejudiced in the manner said to underpin that objection. Put simply, the Noorani test is not satisfied.	Kuwait Investment Office v Simon Hard	3. This is the claimant’s appeal against the decision of EJ Aspden, at a case management hearing on 5 August 2021, refusing her application for a specific disclosure order. The claimant was represented at that hearing by Mr Powell of counsel through direct access. The respondents were represented by Mr Bromige of counsel. Both appeared again at the hearing of this appeal. At the time of the 5 August tribunal hearing the full merits hearing was due to open in September 2021.

On 28 December 2018, and in response to the rejection of her grievance, the claimant resigned. She said in her email to the respondent that she considered herself to have been constructively dismissed because of a “ unilateral and major change ” to her contract of employment. This was the change implemented by the letter dated 13 November 2018, and which took effect on 3 December 2018. The ET said that, by resigning, the claimant accepted the respondent’s repudiation (paragraph 51). The claimant’s resignation did not say when her notice would end, but the ET concluded – and it recorded that it did so with the respondent’s agreement – that she was giving four weeks’ notice. That would take her to 25 January 2019. (Clare Jackson v The University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust)	18. On 28 December 2018, and in response to the rejection of her grievance, the claimant resigned. She said in her email to the respondent that she considered herself to have been constructively dismissed because of a “ unilateral and major change ” to her contract of employment.

That would take her to 25 January 2019.	Clare Jackson v The University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust	14. The ET found that this letter was not a letter of dismissal, by which I think it meant it was not a letter of express dismissal. It noted: “ There was not an intention on the part of the respondent to terminate the employment of the claimant; it wished to continue to employ the claimant having downgraded her (with two years pay protection). The respondent now accepts that this was in repudiatory breach of contract ” (paragraph 35). I should add that the respondent did not accept at the time that this was a repudiatory breach; it was a concession it only made before the ET at the hearing. The ET adopted that concession (paragraph 81).	Clare Jackson v The University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust	3. The ET erred in its approach to constructive dismissal notwithstanding that the ET already found as a fact that the Claimant was going to resign at para 87 of the judgment; the Claimant did so as a result of the victimising conduct complained of above that he was subjected to.	A Achi v GMB  Anor	14. The ET’s reasons for rejecting the Claimant’s claims are set out at para. 59 and following: 60. It is clear that as early as 30 March 2016, when the Claimant met Professor Gathercole, both had substantial concerns about the relationships within the Unit where the Claimant was working. She had a meeting with the Claimant on 29 March 2016 and the following day confirmed the terms of the meeting in writing to the Claimant. She described the situation within the department as “close to unworkable due to lack of trust” and recorded the Claimant as having agreed to this. ... 61. … between April 2016 and the Employment Tribunal Hearing in February 2017, the Respondent took a decision to simply leave matters until the Tribunal process was concluded. We can understand that. Dr Thompson was in the unenviable position of having to cope with the day-to-day running of a department where one of his three members of staff had accused him of treating him unfavourably on racial grounds. In those circumstances, even the most reasonable management instruction can be misinterpreted, particularly as the Claimant was wont, in the words of the Tribunal Judgment of February 2017, to cast about for allegations of discrimination and pursue them regardless of their lack of merit.	H Fullah v The Medical Research Council  Ors	5. The ET applied the wrong test, viewed as a whole, in the context of victimising (and/or unreasonable conduct), the last incident where the Claimant’s sick pay was stopped and was enough to constitute a constructive dismissal, LB of Waltham Forest v Omilaju [2005] IRLR 35 CA, Nottinghamshire CC v Meikle [2002] IRLR 703 CA and Mruke v Khan [2018] IRLR 526 CA.”	A Achi v GMB  Anor	14. The Grounds of Resistance, 23 rd July 2019, defended all claims on the merits and alleged that the Claimant had been dismissed for gross misconduct and fairly so. At para. 3.10 the Respondent contended that any treatment of the Claimant’s entitlement to time off in lieu was fair and correct and in accordance with the Respondent’s written policy.	A Thomas v St Mungo Housing Association	31. The allegations of less favourable treatment were limited to those in the ET1. The ET identified five matters that were to be considered: • The respondent’s reaction to the claimant’s complaint of harassment (the “father’s day comment” ) at the meeting with Ms Murphy on 21 August 2017 where Ms Murphy was said to have received the complaint by “making an ugly face over her raised shoulder and a “ppff” comment” • The failure to investigate the claimant’s complaint. This was described as raising concerns and complaints about Ms Milton’s conduct and ineffective management of the finance department • The refusal to release details of the complaints against the claimant. • The conduct of Ms Murphy. • The claimant’s dismissal.	A v Carers Trust South East Wales	25. On 12 December 2018, the claimant resigned, relying on the complaints about her treatment she had raised in her grievance and asserting that there had been a failure to make reasonable adjustments.	A Field v Steve Pye and Co KL Limited  Ors	9. When the Appellant then proceeded to raise a formal grievance, the Appellant's UK Managing Director indicated that he was very surprised and disappointed that she wished to do so. The ET was critical of the Managing Director’s response (para 108).	A Wainwright v Cennox PLC	28. On the other hand, Ms Cullen returns to the ET’s findings at para. 200, (which I bear in mind must be read in context), which are that the Appellant was misled; and that she reasonably concluded that her colleague’s appointment was only a temporary one. It was only on 30 th August 2019, a short period before the Appellant’s resignation on 27 th September 2019, that the Appellant discovered the truth, not from the Respondent, but from her colleague, as reflected in the Appellant’s chronology. The ET had also referred in critical terms to the Respondent’s UK Managing Director’s email expressing disappointment, dated 2 nd September 2019, one again only a short period before the Appellant’s resignation. Ms White says that the ET considered and rejected those as reasons for why the Appellant resigned, when the ET stated at para 200: “…However, we do not conclude that the Claimant resigned because of these matters We conclude that she resigned because she was unable to ‘negotiate’ a Director title and status in the new structure…”	A Wainwright v Cennox PLC

Judge Warren, however, considered that there were two absence policies – short-term absence and long-term absence. The policies were applied in accordance with their terms and whilst the employer did take all of the absences into consideration, they also exercised discretion at preventing the claimant from reaching a stage 4 dismissal on at least three earlier occasions.	Edge Hill University v E Glasby	8. Following a number of occasions when the claimant was late for meetings or appointments there was a disciplinary hearing on 24 February 2017 arising from which Ms Gearing issued the claimant with a written warning. There were also exchanges in which she refused him leave to attend two events, in one case because two other members were on leave the same day, in the other because he had a full diary that day. Ms Gearing indicated that she would reconsider if he obtained cover. On 9 March Mr Morgan heard the claimant’s appeal against the written warning, which he dismissed.	A Achi v GMB  Anor	30. Generally, the starting point will be to consider whether the alleged harasser was at work, in working hours carrying out work activities. The Employment Tribunal was right to consider “whether the impugned act was done at work or outside of work”: Forbes . The Employment Tribunal was entitled to hold that the act of harassment was not done while CD was at work and that he was not at the time carrying out his work duties. The findings that CD was not due to work at Hereford, was not required to drive the claimant to Hereford, there was no expectation of informal lifts and that CD’s offer to drive the claimant to Hereford was not arranged or sanctioned by the Respondent were relevant to that conclusion.

Mr Haastrup has also identified the areas of public, as well as private, concern about which he wishes to speak. These include: (1) the negligence of King’s staff during Isaiah’s birth; (2) the alleged financial motivation for taking the end-of-life route, in the context of the Trust’s liability in damages for medical negligence; and (3) the circumstances surrounding Isaiah’s last day of life.	Abbasi and another v Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust	3. The Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (“the Trust”) was established on 1 January 2005 as an NHS Foundation Trust and acquired the rights and liabilities of its predecessor, the Chesterfield and North Derbyshire Royal Hospital NHS Trust. Mr Edwards had been employed by the Trust’s predecessor as a consultant trauma and orthopaedic surgeon pursuant to a contract which incorporated the terms of its letter to Mr Edwards dated 2 June 1998. Para 2 of the letter referred to the Trust terms and conditions of employment copies of which could be seen at the Medical Personnel Office. Para 8 stated that the employment was subject to three months’ notice on either side. Para 13 stated that in matters of professional misconduct, Mr Edwards would be subject to a separate procedure which had been negotiated and agreed by the Local Negotiating Committee.	Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust	31. The Trusts made cross-applications that new injunctions be granted in substantially the same terms, should the parents’ applications succeed. The Trusts relied on statements from a registrar for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, a consultant in intensive care medicine on behalf of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the paediatric adviser to the NHS Practitioner Health Programme, the head of legal services at the Royal College of Nursing, the medical director and deputy chief executive of the Newcastle Trust, the clinical director of child health at King’s, and the president of the Paediatric Critical Care Society. There was no focus on, or evidence relating to, any individual clinicians or health care providers.	Abbasi and another v Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust	8. Notwithstanding that, in view of Mr Y’s death, the proceedings could no longer serve any purpose for him and his family, this court determined that the appeal should go ahead, because of the general importance of the issues raised by the case. Accordingly, the court has received full argument from Mr Gordon QC and Ms Paterson for the Official Solicitor, and Mr Sachdeva QC and Ms Dobson for the first two respondents (the NHS Trust which manages the regional hyper-acute rehabilitation unit at which Mr Y was a patient until he was discharged to a nursing home and the Clinical Commissioning Group which funded the nursing home). Written submissions were permitted from the four intervenors. Mrs Y understandably felt unable to participate in the proceedings at what is an exceptionally sad and difficult time for her and her family.	An NHS Trust and others v Y by his litigation friend the Official Solicitor and another	192. Clearly the child, and those acting for them, have no standing to act on behalf of the clinicians to seek to vindicate the clinicians’ rights, nor to make submissions on their behalf. The question, arises, however, whether the hospital trust has standing to do these things in the pressurised circumstances of the initial phase.	Abbasi and another v Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust	13. Zainab’s parents remain critical of the care received by their daughter, which they regard as symptomatic of a wider dysfunctionality affecting the Trust’s paediatric intensive care unit. They wish to publicise their account of the treatment which she received, naming the relevant clinicians, so that they may bring about a more general investigation of the unit in the public interest. (2) The Haastrup case	Abbasi and another v Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust	11. The Trust then applied for a continuation of the injunction, relying on a statement from two of Zainab’s doctors to the effect that without anonymisation it would be possible for the hospital, the treating team, Zainab and her family to be identified. It based its application on article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (“the Convention”), which protects the right to respect for private and family life, the home and correspondence. In that regard, the Trust relied on the article 8 rights of the persons in relation to whom the order was sought. On 12 September 2019 Lieven J issued an injunction, the main terms of which we set out below. The order was made without opposition following a public hearing at which the Trust, Zainab’s CAFCASS guardian and the Press Association were represented.	Abbasi and another v Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust	39. There is therefore not a claimant and one or more defendants in the usual sense, each pursuing their own interests in competition with each other. But there are of course parties to the proceedings. They are commenced because someone (usually the hospital entity, here two NHS trusts) has brought the need for a decision as to the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment to the attention of the court. The respondents are normally the parents or guardian of the child, any other person who has an interest in or relationship to the child, and the child, represented by a guardian who is independent of both the trust and the parents with whom the trust may be in dispute.	Abbasi and another v Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust	114. If, on the other hand, the child remains alive after the proceedings have ended, then the trust will retain standing to apply to the court under the parens patriae jurisdiction provided it is continuing to care for the child. It will also have standing to invoke the Broadmoor jurisdiction. The parties with standing to seek the protection of the clinicians’ rights will be the clinicians themselves.

Tribunal	Dissenting	Declan Durey v South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust.xml	Middle	Disclosure 9: The claimant contends that on the 25 September 2018 he informed Ms Jann about a number of matters during her investigation. The claimant relies on a list of seventeen acts or omissions by the respondent in the way it had dealt with the investigation into events around the matters giving rise to the disciplinary proceedings against Colleague X. The claimant states that these matters tended to show that the health or safety of service users of the respondent had been or was being endangered.	154. The Tribunal is satisfied that in respect of the claimant’s assertion that “an audit of a 999-call revealed that the call handler did not manage the clinical situation safely to reach a safe and appropriate outcome” the claimant made a disclosure of facts that in the reasonable belief of the claimant tended to show that the health or safety of service users of the respondent had been or was being endangered. We are satisfied that such a disclosure was in the public interest.”	The Tribunal is satisfied that in respect of the claimant’s assertion that “an audit of a 999-call revealed that the call handler did not manage the clinical situation safely to reach a safe and appropriate outcome” the claimant made a disclosure of facts that in the reasonable belief of the claimant tended to show that the health or safety of service users of the respondent had been or was being endangered.

Having explored with the claimant why she reasonably believed the disclosure to be in the public interest, Judge Moore notes “she relies on the disclosure not being related to her own contract and that other members of staff were concerned about Mr Davies “going over the edge” as being sufficient to make the disclosure in the public interest”. (A v Carers Trust South East Wales)	36. Having explored with the claimant why she reasonably believed the disclosure to be in the public interest, Judge Moore notes “she relies on the disclosure not being related to her own contract and that other members of staff were concerned about Mr Davies “going over the edge” as being sufficient to make the disclosure in the public interest”.	A v Carers Trust South East Wales	66. In paragraph 126c, the ET find that the claimant did hold the belief that the disclosure was in the public interest as other members of staff were also concerned. However, the ET concluded that this belief was not a reasonable belief based on the facts and circumstances at the time. “The belief was not supported by anyone even Mr Davies”.	A v Carers Trust South East Wales	23. Whether a belief that the disclosure tends to show wrongdoing or is made in the public interest is reasonably held is an objective question to be determined by the tribunal in light of all the circumstances of the particular case: Chesterton at [37] and [40]. Determination of the factual accuracy of the disclosure will in many cases be an important tool in determining whether the worker had a reasonable belief that it tended to show wrongdoing: Darnton at [29]. Documents which may support the reasonableness of the worker’s belief are not limited to those of which they were aware when they made the disclosure: Santander at [12]. A disclosure may be considered to be reasonably viewed as being in the public interest for reasons that the worker did not have in mind at the time when they made it: Chesterton at [29].	A Dodd v UK Direct Solutions Limited  Anor	47. Mr Howells accepted that claimant was upset. Had the ET correctly identified the utterance, they would have concluded the words were sufficiently precise and that they identified that the behaviour was having a detrimental effect on claimant’s health and others. This was clearly capable of being a disclosure of information that the health and safety of any individual was being or was likely to be endangered.	A v Carers Trust South East Wales	85. I add that it does appear to me in any event that the main plank of the claimant’s case that she reasonably believed her claimed PDs to be made in the public interest, is the proposition that the disclosures were of serious unlawful conduct by way of fraud on HMRC, and mis-selling, including the making of secret commissions, contrary to the regulatory regime. In other words, in this case the public interest dimension is said to derive from the inherent nature of the alleged conduct. This reinforces my conclusion that the tribunal was not wrong not to consider that the wide-ranging disclosure sought was necessary to the resolution of this particular aspect.	A Dodd v UK Direct Solutions Limited  Anor	78. However, the ET did go on to consider other aspects of the Kilraine test. They consider that a disclosure that an employee is in a “desperate state” due to stress “could have a tendency to show that his employer is breaching his obligation of duty of care to protect his well-being” but that what was fatal to the claim was the public interest element. The ET concluded that, the claimant did believe that Mr Davies was “going over the edge” and that she believed that, because other members of staff believed the same, this made it a public interest disclosure. The ET concluded this was not a reasonable belief. They further concluded that this was a “workplace dispute” in terms of Chesterton and was not protected as there was only one employee affected (Mr Davies) and Mr Davies was not affected as the claimant believed he was. These two factors overrode the potential for public interest that arose because of the nature of the respondent’s business.	A v Carers Trust South East Wales	65. The words “is made in the public interest and” were inserted into the preamble of section 43B(1) in 2013. They have the effect of imposing an additional requirement that the disclosure must be one which, in the reasonable belief of the worker making it, is made in the public interest. Once again this requires the tribunal, first, to consider whether the worker who made the disclosure subjectively did believe, at the time when they made it, that it was made in the public interest. If so, the tribunal must also consider whether that belief was objectively reasonable.	A Dodd v UK Direct Solutions Limited  Anor	65. Ground 2 asserts that the tribunal erred by not addressing whether the claimant believed, and did so reasonably, that her disclosures were made in the public interest. Mr Allen KC submitted that there was simply no reference to these strands of the test at all. He acknowledged, however, that whether this ground had any traction depended on the fate of other grounds.	A McDermott v Sellafield Ltd  Ors	67. Underhill LJ was, there, I think, simply making a point which flows from the fact that the test of reasonableness turns on the tribunal’s own assessment, not on why the worker, at the time when they made the disclosure, thought that it was made in the public interest. Nor do I think that this passage affects the insight offered by Korashi . In relation to belief in public interest, as with belief that the disclosure tends to show wrongdoing, the worker must in fact hold the belief at the time of the disclosure. It would not be enough for the tribunal to conclude that, had they held belief, it would have been reasonable. While, again, the reasonableness test is objective, and may be satisfied by considerations that the worker did not have in mind at the time, the test is still whether their belief was reasonable when they formed it. As Underhill LJ put it in Chesterton at [27]: “The tribunal thus has to ask (a) whether the worker believed, at the time that he was making it, that the disclosure was in the public interest and (b) whether, if so, that belief was reasonable.”	A Dodd v UK Direct Solutions Limited  Anor	66. In Chesterton , in the course of some preliminary remarks about the general architecture of the section, Underhill LJ said, at [29]: “T hird, the necessary belief is simply that the disclosure is in the public interest. The particular reasons why the worker believes that to be so are not of the essence. That means that a disclosure does not cease to qualify simply because the worker seeks, as not uncommonly happens, to justify it after the event by reference to specific matters which the tribunal finds were not in his head at the time he made it. Of course, if he cannot give credible reasons for why he thought at the time that the disclosure was in the public interest, that may cast doubt on whether he really thought so at all; but the significance is evidential not substantive. Likewise, in principle a tribunal might find that the particular reasons why the worker believed the disclosure to be in the public interest did not reasonably justify his belief, but nevertheless find it to have been reasonable for different reasons which he had not articulated to himself at the time: all that matters is that his (subjective) belief was (objectively) reasonable.”	A Dodd v UK Direct Solutions Limited  Anor
Tribunal	Dissenting	Declan Durey v South Central Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust.xml	End	73. These two strands of this ground face the following difficulties.  First, as to (a) the tribunal made a finding, in terms, at [167] that Mrs Gregory’s intention was to be supportive.  The respondent’s case was that, in light of the claimant, in his reply to her initial email, expressing concerns about how colleagues had been treating him, she felt that a meeting, rather than more emails, was needed; and it was her usual practice to relieve such an employee of their duties in order to facilitate such a meeting.  The tribunal heard Mrs Gregory give evidence, and it was entitled to accept the respondent’s case as to her motivation.  The high hurdle for a perversity challenge described by Mummery LJ in Yeboah v Crofton [2002] EWCA Civ 794; [2002] IRLR 634 is not surpassed.

In relation to Ms Saunders, as framed in the list of issues, the complaint was that she failed to prevent a recurrence of the conduct of which the claimant had complained in his grievance of 4 December 2018, when, by an email of 13 December, Mrs Gregory reiterated her intention to stand him down from his duties in order to meet her.  However, it appears that the emails showed that Mrs Gregory had first proposed to meet in early December, but later put forward revised dates, and, specifically, proposed 13 December in an email of 10 December.  The claimant then complained of that to Ms Saunders.  She then emailed him on 12 December informing him that Mrs Gregory would not be involved in line managing him until the grievance was resolved, and also asked him to provide suitable dates for a meeting with Ludlow Johnson (who was to investigate the grievance).  It was the respondent’s case that when, on 10 December, Mrs Gregory had emailed the claimant suggesting 13 December as a revised date for their meeting, she had not yet been told of the grievance.	0.5667	0.4794	0.5667, 0.5641, 0.5337, 0.5207, 0.5181, 0.4875, 0.4776, 0.4634, 0.4503, 0.4452	59. Having regard to all of that, and placing this finding in the context of the tribunal’s overall reasoning and the other shortcomings of it that I have described, I have concluded that this ground also succeeds in relation to this aspect of the conduct complained of, as the tribunal’s decision in relation to it is at best inadequately reasoned and explained. (Blackdown Hill Management Limited  Anor v Anastasia Tuchkova)	59. Having regard to all of that, and placing this finding in the context of the tribunal’s overall reasoning and the other shortcomings of it that I have described, I have concluded that this ground also succeeds in relation to this aspect of the conduct complained of, as the tribunal’s decision in relation to it is at best inadequately reasoned and explained.	Blackdown Hill Management Limited  Anor v Anastasia Tuchkova	10. The employment tribunal recorded at paragraph 19: It is accepted what Mrs Pye said in a meeting on 29 November 2018, with the independent investigator looking into the claimant’s grievance letter, that the email to the claimant of 24 August 2018 was prompted because Mrs Pye was irritated and annoyed by the claimant’s attendance, “ …she was winding me up something chronic … And yeah – lost my rag ”. (Page 267 of the Hearing Bundle) Mrs Pye admitted in another interview with her advisers (page 405) reference to her email to the claimant of 24 August 2018, “ I am not proud of it ” [emphasis added]	A Field v Steve Pye and Co KL Limited  Ors	42. The judge’s observations at [35] and [36] about the need for focus on the issues that the tribunal actually had to decide were in point. She rightly identified that the respondents were not advancing a positive case that they did not commit wrongdoing in order to support their case that they did not subject the claimant to detriment because of the claimed PDs . Rather, the specific detailed section of the grounds of resistance responding to the allegations of detrimental treatment, took issue with much of what the claimant said factually had occurred, advanced the respondents’ case as to the true facts of what occurred, and denied that such conduct as did occur was because of the claimed PDs, and/or simply advanced positive explanations for it. In any event, the judge was entitled to weigh in the balance the degree of potential relevance of this aspect, and to conclude that it was, at its highest, of limited relevance.	A Dodd v UK Direct Solutions Limited  Anor	55. Fourthly, I was referred to evidence of a transcript of exchanges during the claimant’s internal grievance hearing, in the course of which she had said that at first her feeling was that this had been done intentionally, but that now her feeling was that it was because of what was put as being a lack of structure – the sentiment being that this was not a deliberate act, but that the slowness in dealing with the matter was the result of disorganisation.	Blackdown Hill Management Limited  Anor v Anastasia Tuchkova	44. Ms Egan confirmed in oral argument that the premise of these grounds is that the conduct that the tribunal was referring to at [63] was the drafting of the witness statement for Ms Fox, which Mr Mayall had sent to her. Ms Egan contended that it was not inherently wrong for a party to prepare a draft statement for a proposed witness to consider. The tribunal erred by regarding that as unreasonable conduct. The text messages supported the respondent’s case that Ms Fox had indicated, at one point, that she would be prepared to act as a witness for the respondent.	Edenbeck Limited v E Stevenson	iii) Her true view was that the claimant had been evasive rather than deceptive;	Jones v Kaney	15. Objectively, and read as a whole, the correspondence did not amount to a discussion about fabricating a false position or acting in an underhand or iniquitous way amounting to a sham. Rather, it was consistent with a solicitor encouraging his client to bring in a senior manager as, “a fresh pair of eyes” (an expression which features in the chain albeit not directly from Mr Mutch) to look at the case again before any decision to dismiss became final by its intimation to the appellant. It was clearly anticipated by both Mr Mutch and by Ms White that the final decision would be that of the more senior manager. This is clear from the reference in Mr Mutch’s email of 25 April at 12.49 to “his decision” and to Ms White’s description of Mr Cooper as “the decision maker” in her email of 16.45 on 26 April.	C Shawcross v SMG Europe Holdings Limited  Ors	56. In relation to this matter, I consider this ground to be close to the margin. I cannot go behind the tribunal’s finding that what the second respondent and Ms Stenina had to say about this was “speculative”; and the specific email in the tribunal’s bundle that I was shown does not entirely settle the point, because that seems to be addressed to copying of the files for the use of someone else, rather than the reason why the claimant’s laptop was also wiped once that was done. I need to be mindful of the fact that I do not have before me all of the evidence that the tribunal had on this subject, and I am not remaking the tribunal’s findings of fact.	Blackdown Hill Management Limited  Anor v Anastasia Tuchkova	74. In the present case, this ground was originally ground 7. But the EAT judge who directed five grounds to proceed, directed that amended grounds of appeal be lodged in which this ground was to appear as ground 1. He also directed that the employment judge should then be asked to comment on “ground 7 (to be renumbered ground 1).” The amended grounds were then lodged and sealed on 6 September 2024. The EAT judge then made a further order, inviting the employment judge’s comments on “renumbered Ground 1 (as issued on 6 September 2024)”. The EAT emailed the employment judge the amended grounds, together with the EAT judge’s order sealed on 24 October 2024. The covering email drew the employment judge’s attention to paragraph 1.	A  Anor v C Limited  Ors	123. L Bowen was not CL’s line manager and so was not directly responsible for managing his absence, that would have been CB. The Claimant said that she nonetheless approached L Bowen about the issue because she was the person with whom she had an existing relationship, not CB. She acknowledged that she believed L Bowen did care about CL, and that she believed her when she said she was aware of the problem already and that she would look into it.

Tribunal	Concurring	Commerzbank AG v J Rajput.xml	Middle	17. However, far from that prompting decisions on these matters of fundamental importance, the judge sent a decision to the parties on 8th September 2021 refusing the respondent’s application for a preliminary hearing.  This time the judge’s reasoning was that this was a matter for the fulltribunal, i.e. with judge and lay members, and that it would not be appropriate for him to deal with the matter in advance, sitting alone:   “25. The order sought at paragraph 14 envisages that I make a ruling, by myself, as a process of case management, on what findings of fact contained in the Tayler judgment, as remitted, are binding on a tribunal which hears that remitted claim. Such a ruling would fundamentally affect the rights of both parties to rely on findings of fact. It is common ground that at least some of the findings of fact are binding. To the extent that there is a dispute, it concerns which findings of fact are binding, and which are not. 26. To resolve what facts remain binding, it is necessary, first, to finally determine what matters have been remitted. Whilst I have sought, at some length, to assist the parties with this, and whilst I have set out my understanding, that provisional ruling remains subject to any submissions by the parties. The determination of the scope of remission is for the tribunal that hears the remitted claim. It is for that tribunal, as a tribunal, to determine what claims have been remitted. When that process has been undertaken, it will be necessary for the tribunal to understand, having regard to the reason for remission, what effect it has, if any, on all or any of the findings of fact of the Tayler tribunal. Put simply, the tribunal that hears the remitted claim must decide which of the findings of fact are disturbed, and which are not. 27. It is possible that all of the findings of fact remain binding. I have previously noted that the remission appears to revolve around matters treated as facts by the Tayler tribunal, but for which there was no evidence, or at least there was a failure to properly identify the contention that stereotypes exist and put the contention to any witness. It appears the EAT found that the Tayler tribunal either directly relied on those erroneous facts or drew impermissible secondary inferences. However, none of that, necessarily, undermines the findings of fact made by the Tayler Tribunal legitimately based on the evidence presented. … 30. I have considered whether determining what facts are binding could be some form of the preliminary issue. I find that preliminary issues can incorporate matters of evidence and findings of fact. For example, there may be a dispute as to whether certain evidence is admissible. It may be appropriate for a ruling on admissibility to be made prior to a hearing. The effect may be, ultimately, to determine the claim. That would be a preliminary issue. 31. Specific discrete facts are often found by way preliminary issue, for example, the date of dismissal. Whilst those facts may be disputed, they can be resolved at a preliminary hearing, by way of a preliminary issue, by a judge sitting alone. However, the more ingrained the disputed facts are with the issues in the case, the less suitable is the matter for resolution as a preliminary issue. In this case, what facts remain binding at the remitted hearing cannot be excised, as some form of preliminary issue, from the main determination of the claim. What facts remain binding is fundamental to the resolution of this claim and should not be dealt with as a preliminary issue. 32. It follows from what I have said that the order sought at paragraph 14 of the application is not one which can be determined as a matter of case management, and it is not one which should be determined as a preliminary issue. It must be determined by the final tribunal.”	However, far from that prompting decisions on these matters of fundamental importance, the judge sent a decision to the parties on 8th September 2021 refusing the respondent’s application for a preliminary hearing.

A witness order was issued for Ms Murphy, however she applied to set aside that order and the respondent applied to adjourn the hearing until Ms Murphy could attend. This was opposed by the claimant and the ET decided to set aside the witness order and proceed with the hearing without Ms Murphy’s evidence. There was a bundle of 591 pages.	A v Carers Trust South East Wales	60. We would add that it is unfortunate that, now approaching five years since the claimant’s employment was terminated, this matter, at least in relation to these complaints, remains unresolved and will have to return to the tribunal, unless the parties are able to reach some other resolution. Directing a completely new panel will also have an additional benefit that the tribunal will not be constrained in convening a panel for a further hearing, by the availability of the members who sat previously on the matter.	Edge Hill University v E Glasby	88. It follows from this that the present case does not fall within the ambit of Article 6 ECHR for the purposes of the Article 14 analysis. As noted above, this was the conclusion which the Employment Judge TR Smith reached in Mr L’s case and it is challenged under Ground 3. Mr Hirst, for Mr Dunn, appears to have come to the same conclusion in not pursuing the Article 14 argument on this particular basis. The, with respect, obvious flaw in Ms Braganza’s argument under Ground 3 is that Article 6 presupposes the existence of a civil right and then requires that it be determined at a fair and public hearing etc. It is directed at procedural rules or practices which prevent this from occurring. In the present case, the problem is that Parliament has not conferred a civil right on Mr L not to be subjected to disability discrimination, rather than that Mr L enjoys such a right but has been denied a fair and public hearing of the question whether it has been breached.	L  Anor v Ministry of Defence	18. The Bank then appealed to this Court. Before the hearing of the appeal, it was clear that the Treasury would ask this Court to look at the closed judgment of Mitting J. Therefore, it was agreed between the parties that the first day of the three day appeal should be given over to the question of whether the Supreme Court could conduct a closed hearing. At the end of that day’s argument, we announced that, by a majority, we had decided that we could do so and that we would give our reasons later.	Bank Mellat v Her Majestys Treasury No 1	23. The Chancellor wanted to ensure that the court’s decision was not overridden by “an unaccountable membership” (Judgment, para 38). The Chancellor noted that the position of Dr Lehtimäki, a Harvard and Stanford-trained economist, was one of “studied neutrality” and that it was “perhaps” more likely than not that he would vote against any section 217 resolution but the Chancellor stated that he would not take any suspicion on that point into account as Dr Lehtimäki had not been cross-examined (para 121). Dr Lehtimäki did not consider that he was bound to vote in favour of the section 217 resolution (para 132).	Lehtimäki and others v Cooper	19. In light of the conclusion I have reached on the first limb of the argument I will sustain decision of the Employment Judge and refuse the appeal.	C Shawcross v SMG Europe Holdings Limited  Ors	364. In the meantime, the courts will have to deal with any individual cases which may come before them. But, in the present proceedings, there is no need for this court to pre-empt democratic debate on changes to the law or to the arrangements for the provision of health services, or, by determining the requirements of the Convention in advance of that debate, to take the matter out of the hands of democratically accountable institutions.	In the matter of an application by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for Judicial Review
Tribunal	Concurring	Commerzbank AG v J Rajput.xml	End	I agree with the submissions made by Mr Craig and Mr Waseem (who appear for the respondent), that a fresh hearing (if directed) will, generally, mean just that; a hearing that considers the matters afresh with no limitation imposed by the findings of the previous tribunal.  I emphasise the word “generally” because that will not always be the case: there can be instances in which a fresh hearing could be directed in respect of a certain aspect of a claim, or in respect of a limited number of issues relatingto that claim.  However, if that is the case, the terms of the order and/or the judgment would, ordinarily, make that clear.  There is no such limitation here and, in fact, the terms of the judgment to which I have just referred make it clear that the stereotypical assumptions aspect of the decision is not something that can simply be hived off for another judge to determine, relying on the facts (or the primary facts) found by the Tayler Tribunal.	27. I was referred to various authorities by Mr Craig.  These include ILEA v Gravett [1988] IRLR 497, Heritage Homecare Ltd v Mason UKEAT/0273/14 and Elliott v Dorset CountyCouncil [2021] IRLR 880.  Whilst passages in those judgments to which my attention was drawn support the submission that, in those cases, a direction that there be a fresh hearing meant starting the hearing from scratch, I do not consider that any general rule can be laid down that, whenever the term “fresh hearings” is used, it must have that effect.  Each case will depend on its own facts and on the specific terms of the EAT’s judgment.  But, as I have said, in this case the terms of the judgment and the order are clear that the direction that there be a fresh re-hearing meant that the tribunal hearing the remitted matter would have to start from scratch.

Having regard to my overall conclusions, including on ground 1, I think it better that these matters be remitted to a differently constituted tribunal.

There may be a future case arising from facts occurring post-Brexit where a party wishes to put forward an argument that the effect of section 29 is to modify the wording of some existing domestic law on which that party relies. If such a submission is made, that court or tribunal should consider submissions as to the meaning and effect of section 29 afresh. They should not have regard to what has been said by the Court of Appeal in this case. Certainly, no court or tribunal should consider itself required, as Deputy High Court Judge Webb thought he was required, to conduct its own assessment as to whether any “automatic” modification has taken place when the parties are not inviting the court to recognise any such modification.	Lipton and another v BA Cityflyer Ltd	56. Further, in any event, I do not consider that the judgment in Blackwood is capable of forming the basis of a per incuriam argument; Fletcher cannot form the basis as it was a decision of a more junior tribunal than the Court of Appeal. In Blackwood , Underhill LJ (giving the judgment, which was agreed with by Patten and Lewison LJJ) referred to Fletcher at [29]. In that case, Cox J held that “working conditions for vocational trainees” (in that case, student midwives) fell within Directive 76/207, and this meant that they could complain of sex discrimination if they were deprived of financial support during pregnancy. Having referred to Fletcher , Underhill LJ stated that: “That decision is not binding on us, but Mr Milsom submitted that it was correct and that Cox J’s reasoning applied equally to the Equal Treatment Directive in its current form. Mr Pepperall did not seek to argue otherwise. I find Cox J’s reasoning persuasive and I am content to proceed on the basis that Fletcher’s case was correctly decided.” This statement by Underhill LJ, referring to the Equal Treatment Directive, is not a statement of principle and did not form part of the ratio decidendi of Blackwood . Accordingly, that statement would not have been binding on the Court of Appeal in Royal Parks subject to the principles for departure in Young v Bristol Aeroplane Co Ltd [1944] KB 718 , aff’d [1946] AC 163 . Moreover, that statement did not refer to the Race Equality Directive.	Alpha Anne and Ors v Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust	33. The second ground of appeal is that the employment judge erred in concluding that the application to amend did not involve “re-labelling”. The employment judge concluded that the application to amend did not amount to relabelling because the “types of complaint” were “different to those originally pleaded”. With respect to the employment judge, that is the nature of relabelling. Relabelling generally involves seeking to amend to assert a new cause of action resulting from the factual allegations that have already been pleaded. I conclude that ground 2 is made out.	A Chaudhry v Cerberus Security and Monitoring Services Limited	6. If either party has any evidence or submissions to put before the First-tier Tribunal (different to, or in addition to, that before the First-tier Tribunal when it made the decision of 14 September 2023) this should be sent to the regional office of His Majesty's Courts and Tribunals Service within one month of the date on which this decision is issued. For the avoidance of doubt, submissions and/or evidence provided by a party in the course of the Upper Tribunal proceedings, which are disposed of by this decision, will not be before the First-tier Tribunal, unless the party chooses to send them to the First-tier Tribunal under the terms of this direction.	ABH v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions  Anor	34. For all those reasons, I uphold this part of ground 2. Fresh consideration will need to be given to whether there were, in these respects, breaches of the Code , and, if so, the other statutory questions.	A  Anor v C Limited  Ors	38. Maurice Kay LJ pointed out (at para 18) that neither the Cotswold “integration” test nor the Redcats “dominant purpose” test purported to lay down a test of general application. In his view they were wise “not to lay down a more prescriptive approach which would gloss the words of the statute”. Judge Peter Clark in the EAT had taken the view that Dr Westwood was a limb (b) worker because he had agreed to provide his services as a hair restoration surgeon exclusively to HMG, he did not offer that service to the world in general, and he was recruited by HMG to work as an integral part of its operations. That was the right approach. The fact that Dr Westwood was in business on his own account was not conclusive because the definition also required that the other party to the contract was not his client or customer and HMG was neither. Maurice Kay LJ concluded, at para 19, by declining the suggestion that the Court might give some guidance as to a more uniform approach: “I do not consider that there is a single key with which to unlock the words of the statute in every case. On the other hand, I agree with Langstaff J that his “integration” test will often be appropriate as it is here”. For what it is worth, the Supreme Court refused permission to appeal in that case.	Clyde  Co LLP and another v Bates van Winkelhof	190. The first question that arises is whether section 29(1) applies in this class of case. Lord Mance discusses this question in detail. He asks three questions. They are whether section 29(1) applies to activities carried on in the workplace, whether it applies to risks of noise-induced hearing loss arising from such activities in relation to long-term employees working in the workplace and what is the meaning of safe. He answers the first two questions in the affirmative. Both Lord Kerr and Lord Dyson agree with him, essentially for the reasons he gives. So do I. In particular, I agree with Lord Kerr and Lord Dyson that, for the reasons they give, the language of the section is “always speaking”.	Baker v Quantum Clothing Group Limited and others	35. Mr Walsh states that consideration of Ancean’s application for authorisation, and the regulatory process arising from its refusal, was conducted by the Authorisations Division (“Authorisations team”), which is separate to EMO, with his assistance and that of another lawyer from Enforcement Legal who is not part of the team conducting the Enforcement References. As a result, the teams conducting the Ancean Reference and the Enforcement References are separate and distinct.	Ancean Limited v The Financial Conduct Authority
