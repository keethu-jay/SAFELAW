In its decision the CAC noted that some of the earlier contracts were still in force but Deliveroo was encouraging Riders on the earlier contract to change to the new contract and newly recruited Riders were required to sign the new contract. The parties before the CAC agreed that it should consider the question of worker status by reference to the new contract and not the earlier contract. The CAC, therefore, at the request of the parties, considered the position as at May 2017 and ongoing under the new contract and the position in practice. It noted that both the contractual terms and the position in practice under the earlier contract were markedly different from the new contract. The earlier contract involved much more control and direction by Deliveroo, including strict uniform requirements, a different attitude to substitutes and in other significant respects. It found, however, that both the written contractual terms and how the parties conducted themselves had changed with the introduction of the new contract. The CAC appears to have accepted Deliveroo&#8217;s submission that the new terms were permissible even if they had been introduced by Deliveroo to defeat this claim and to prevent the Riders from being classified as workers: see para 99.

If the Rider did not want to accept a job or be available for work they did not need to log on to the App, or if they were logged on they did not need to make themselves available. If they were logged on and marked themselves as available they were not under any obligation to accept any jobs offered.

Given that Deliveroo stressed the total flexibility of its Riders&#8217; ability to log in, as and when they wished, and to decline offers of a delivery, even when logged on, and even to abandon a delivery midway, why would the question of substitution ever arise? Furthermore, why would Deliveroo spend so much time, money and energy in selecting and training Riders when the Riders could then sub-contract the right to use the App as they chose? On behalf of the Union it had been submitted that there was, in reality, no substitution right. The &#8220;bland&#8221; response on behalf of Deliveroo had been that it was a matter for Deliveroo if it was willing to invest in training for its Riders, knowing that they could sub-contract whenever they chose.

In light of its central finding on substitution, it could not be said that the Riders undertook to perform personally any work or services for another party for the purposes of section 296(1)(b) TULRCA (set out at para 19 above). That was fatal to the Union&#8217;s claim. A Rider would not be penalised by Deliveroo for not personally making the delivery herself or himself, provided the substitute complied with the contractual terms that applied to the Rider. The CAC noted that a high level of trust in the substitute was required in the Rider, because the substitute had to have the Rider&#8217;s phone or password to download the Rider&#8217;s App and because of the contractual obligations of the Rider in respect of the substitute.

Orthodox priests and lay employees of the Archdiocese of Craiova in Romania formed a trade union called &#8220;The Good Shepherd&#8221;. Its elected president applied to a court for the union to be granted legal personality and entered in the register of trade unions. This was opposed by the Archdiocese. At first instance the application succeeded but the decision was reversed and the trade union&#8217;s registration was revoked. The union then brought proceedings against Romania before the Strasbourg Court alleging that the refusal of its application for registration as a trade union had infringed its members&#8217; right to form a trade union under article 11 ECHR. A chamber of the Third Section of the Court found a violation of article 11. At a further hearing before a Grand Chamber the Archdiocese argued that the emergence of such a body would imperil the freedom of religious denominations to organise themselves in accordance with their own traditions and would undermine the church&#8217;s traditional structure. It submitted that it was therefore necessary to limit the freedom to form and participate in a trade union. The Grand Chamber held that members of the clergy, notwithstanding their special circumstances, fulfilled their mission in the context of an employment relationship falling within the scope of article 11. It further held, however, that the Romanian court&#8217;s refusal to register the union was justified: there had been no violation of its members&#8217; rights to form a trade union under article 11 because the interference had been prescribed by law, pursued legitimate aims and was necessary in a democratic society.",

That Recommendation makes the point that the determination of such a relationship should be guided primarily by the facts relating to the performance of work and the remuneration of the worker, notwithstanding how the relationship is characterised in any contrary arrangement, contractual or otherwise, that may have been agreed between the parties. The Grand Chamber observed that the duties performed by the members of the trade union in question entailed many of the characteristic features of an employment relationship. It acknowledged that a particular feature of the work of members of the clergy was that it also pursued a spiritual purpose and was carried out within a church enjoying a certain degree of autonomy, and that members of the clergy were bound by a heightened personal duty of loyalty.

Sigurj&#972;nsson   v Iceland    (1993) 16 EHRR 462  concerned the refusal of a taxi driver to join an automobile association which, inter alia, protected taxi drivers&#8217; rights. The decision of the Court that there had been a violation of his right under article 11 not to be forced to join the association does not cast any light on the present issue as it was not necessary to decide whether the association could be regarded as a trade union within article 11. The case was decided on the basis that it fell within the wider right to freedom of association. Similarly,   &#211;lafsson v Iceland    (2010) 56 EHRR 21 , where a master builder complained of a statutory levy payable to an association of which he was not a member which was required to use it for the promotion of industrial development, was decided on the basis of a violation of his right to freedom of association under article 11. Neither case lends any support for the proposition that the article 11 right to join or to refuse to join a trade union extends to persons who are outside an employment relationship.",

The claimants decided to form an association named &#8220;Agricultural trade union Romanian Farmers Direct&#8221; and applied for its registration with a view to conferring legal personality on it. Its main purpose was to defend the interests of its members, namely farmers and persons providing services for farmers, including transport facilities, to move on from subsistence farming to agriculture which was more directed to the market. To that end it aimed to organise local centres with a view to providing legal information, accountancy advice and judicial assistance to individual farmers. The application for registration was rejected on the ground that only employees holding a contract of employment and civil servants could set up trade unions, to the exclusion of farmers and other self-employed persons who could only join pre-existing trade unions.",

Although the ECHR did not precisely define the concept of a trade union beyond a general indication that it is an association formed for the purpose of defending the interests of its members, most of the cases had concerned employees and, more broadly, persons in an employment relationship. Nevertheless, the Contracting States enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation as to how the freedom of trade unions to protect the occupational interests of their members may be secured (paras 59, 60). The Court held that the refusal of &#8220;the right to be registered as a trade union-type association&#8221; was an interference by Romania with the exercise of the rights guaranteed by article 11 (para 62). The Court went on, however, to conclude that the interference was justified under article 11(2) (para 65).",

There are, however, several unusual features to this decision. First, the association in question does not appear to have had the attributes of a trade union as opposed to that of a trade association. Its purposes, described above, seem to have been those of a trade association. The Court (at para 62) described it as &#8220;a trade union-type association&#8221;. Secondly, the decision is entirely explicable as an application of the more general freedom of association conferred by article 11. Thirdly, the reasoning of the Court in concluding that there had been no violation of article 11 might equally have been presented in support of the proposition that the trade union right was not in play here because it does not extend to such bodies. The Court referred (at para 71) to various observations of the ILO but &#8220;discerns no sufficient reasons to deduce from those general observations that the exclusion of self-employed farmers from the right to form trade unions amounts to a breach of Article 11 of the Convention&#8221;.

The national court was required to base its classification on objective criteria and make an overall assessment of all the circumstances of the case, having regard to the nature of the activities concerned and the relationship of the parties (para 27). The essential feature of an employment relationship was that for a certain period of time a person performed services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he received remuneration (para 29, citing   Fenoll v Centre D&#8217;Aide par le Travail &#8220;La Jouvene&#8221;   ( Case C-316/13 )  [2016] IRLR 67 ). It noted that B appeared to have a great deal of latitude in relation to his putative employer. It was therefore necessary for the referring court to consider whether that independence was merely notional and whether there existed a subordinate relationship (paras 35-37). The classification was a matter for the referring court.

Section 230(3)  defined a &#8220;worker&#8221; as including not only, at (a), an employee under a contract of service but also, at (b), an individual who has entered into or works under &#8220;any other contract &#8230; whereby the individual undertakes to &#8230; perform personally any work or services for another party to the contract whose status is not by virtue of the contract that of a client or customer of any profession or business undertaking carried on by the individual &#8230;&#8221;.

On the facts of the case, he considered that the right to substitute had been regarded as so insignificant as not to be worthy of recognition in the terms deployed in 2009. Furthermore, Pimlico had accepted that it would not be usual for an operative to take responsibility for performing a job by estimating for it and then to substitute another operative to effect performance.

Lord Leggatt added that what was not, however, fully spelt out in   Autoclenz   was the theoretical justification for this approach. While it had been emphasised in   Autoclenz   that in an employment context the parties were frequently of very unequal bargaining power, this was not in general a reason for disapplying or disregarding ordinary principles of contract law, save where Parliament had so provided.

Thus, the task for the tribunals and the courts was not, unless the legislation required it, to identify whether, under the terms of their contracts, Autoclenz had agreed that the claimants should be paid at least the national minimum wage or receive paid annual leave. It was to determine whether the claimants fell within the definition of a &#8220;worker&#8221; in the relevant statutory provisions so as to qualify for these rights irrespective of what had been contractually agreed.

Although Lord Hendy initially argued on this appeal, as he had argued in the courts below, that the right to form and join a trade union was enjoyed by everyone, he did not pursue this submission and accepted that the rights on which the Union is seeking to rely are conferred on persons in the context of an employment relationship. This concession was, in our view, correctly made and compelled by the Strasbourg authorities considered above. We will refer to the class of people on whom article 11 trade union rights are conferred as &#8220;article 11 workers&#8221;.  \n\t\t \n\t       \n\t       \n\t\t (2) \n\t\t \n\t\t    The concept of an employment relationship within article 11 is an autonomous concept that must apply across all the members of the Council of Europe and does not depend on the definitions of workers or employees used in domestic law.  \n\t\t \n\t       \n\t       \n\t\t (3) \n\t\t \n\t\t    In determining whether there is an employment relationship within article 11, the court should consider, inter alia, the factors set out in ILO Recommendation No 198 as referred to in   The Good Shepherd   (at paras 57 and 142). (See paras 41, 57 to 59 above.) This approach is not inconsistent with the strictures in   R (SC) v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions    [2021] UKSC 26 ,  [2022] AC 223  (at paras 2(7)(i), 74-96) against reliance on the provisions of international treaties and instruments which have not been implemented into domestic law. Although the ILO made recommendations to Member States in relation to the identification of an employment relationship in any particular case, in   The Good Shepherd   the Strasbourg court expressly adopted and applied the criteria. They are, as a result, incorporated into the Convention test for the identification of an employment relationship under article 11.   \n\t\t \n\t       \n\t       \n\t\t (4) \n\t\t \n\t\t    The correct approach requires the application of a multifactorial test, focusing on the practicalities of the relationship and how it operates in reality.",

People in such a position, he submitted, needed collective bargaining so as to be able to establish fair working conditions. They should, therefore, be included within the scope of those on whom article 11 trade union rights are conferred. Lord Hendy sought to draw support for this approach from the observation of Underhill LJ in the Court of Appeal that it might at first sight seem counter-intuitive that the Riders were not able to insist that Deliveroo negotiate with the Union:  \n\t\t  \n\t\t     \n\t\t       \n\t\t\t  &#8220;It is easy to see that riders might benefit from organising collectively to represent their interests as against Deliveroo, and it might seem to follow that they should have the right &#8220;to join and form a trade union for the protection of [those] interests.&#8221; (at para 86)   \n\t\t       \n\t\t     \n\t\t    \n\t\t  In this regard Lord Hendy also drew our attention to the decision of the European Committee of Social Rights in   Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) v Ireland   (2018) 68 EHRR SE6.",

However, Supperstone J concluded that the Strasbourg case law did not support the submission that the Riders were workers in the particular circumstances found by the CAC to exist. They were not under the new contract in an employment relationship with Deliveroo: (para 33). The judge was not persuaded that any of the authorities referred to extended the right to bargain collectively beyond an employment relationship: (para 36). He did not consider that, on the findings made by the CAC, the Riders had the right for which the Union contended under article 11. Neither domestic nor Strasbourg case law supported this contention.

      "content_text": "On appeal to the Court of Appeal, Underhill LJ (with whom Coulson and Phillips LJJ agreed)  [2022] ICR 84  came to the same conclusion.  \n\t       \n\t       \n\t\t (1) \n\t\t \n\t\t    Underhill LJ noted that the reasoning of the CAC on this issue, at para 104, was extremely summary. The article 11 point had only been taken in written closing submissions and the short appendix which was said to address the relevant law on article 11 did not refer to materials of central importance, namely the decisions of the Strasbourg court in   The Good Shepherd   or   Manole   or to ILO Recommendation No 198 (para 75).  \n\t\t \n\t       \n\t       \n\t\t (2) \n\t\t \n\t\t    The CAC had, nevertheless, concluded that the Riders were not in an employment relationship with Deliveroo for the purposes of article 11, that being the only issue to which its reference to &#8220;the unfettered and genuine right of substitution that operates both in the written contract and in practice&#8221; was material (para 76).  \n\t\t \n\t       \n\t       \n\t\t (3) \n\t\t \n\t\t    That was a conclusion to which the CAC was entitled to come. The particular feature on which it had relied was its finding that Riders were genuinely not under an obligation to provide their services personally and had a virtually unlimited right of substitution. This, Underhill LJ considered, was on any view a material factor in the decision. Paragraph 13 of ILO Recommendation No 198 referred to the fact that the work &#8220;must be carried out personally by the worker&#8221; as an indicator of an employment relationship and it followed that the absence of such an obligation must be a contra-indicator of worker status. However, in the opinion of Underhill LJ, the CAC was entitled to regard this as decisive. The position taken by English law that (subject to limited exceptions acknowledged in   Pimlico Plumbers  ) an obligation of personal service was an indispensable feature of the relationship of employer and worker was not a parochial peculiarity but was a central feature of such a relationship as ordinarily understood. There was no reason why its importance should be any the less in the context of article 11 (para 77).  \n\t\t \n\t       \n\t       \n\t\t (4) \n\t\t \n\t\t    A submission which relied on the CAC&#8217;s finding that the Riders only rarely took advantage of the right of substitution was rejected. While that might be relevant to the question whether the right was genuine, the challenge was concerned with legal relationships and any test other than what the parties&#8217; genuine rights and obligations were would be unacceptably uncertain. The right to use a substitute would carry no weight if it disguised the reality of the situation, but the CAC had addressed that and the Union had no permission to challenge its conclusion (paras 78-79).  \n\t\t \n\t       \n\t       \n\t\t (5) \n\t\t \n\t\t    There were other features of the relationship between Deliveroo and the Riders which might reinforce the conclusion that they were not in an employment relationship for the purposes of article 11. However, Underhill LJ was reluctant to decide the case on that basis, even by way of alternative, in circumstances where there had been no such assessment by the CAC (para 83).",

As the CAC emphasised, it applies both before and after a Rider has agreed to make a delivery. Such a broad power of substitution is, on its face, totally inconsistent with the existence of an obligation to provide personal service which is essential to the existence of an employment relationship within article 11.

Its detailed examination of how the new contract, and in particular the substitution provisions, operated in practice closely scrutinised whether the contractual provisions genuinely reflected the true relationship. Particularly significant, in this regard, were the following findings of the CAC. It found that there was no policing by Deliveroo of a Rider&#8217;s use of a substitute and Riders would not be criticised or sanctioned for using a substitute despite the purported freedom to do so. It found that, despite Deliveroo&#8217;s right of termination on one week&#8217;s notice for any reason, it did not terminate FPD contracts for a Rider&#8217;s failure to accept a certain percentage of orders or failure to make themselves sufficiently available. It found that Deliveroo did not object to the practice of substitution by a Rider for profit or to Riders working simultaneously for competitors of Deliveroo.

That does not, in our judgment, prevent the procedure from being compulsory at each stage short of that. The compulsory nature of the procedure is apparent from at least the following features. First, at the recognition stage, recognition of the union as entitled to bargain collectively on behalf of the workers can be imposed on the employer if the conditions for an application under paragraph 11 of Schedule A1 are met. Even if the bargaining unit proposed by the union is unsatisfactory, that does not enable the employer to avoid recognising the union since the CAC must identify a bargaining unit which is appropriate: paragraph 19(3). Similarly, if there is uncertainty about whether a significant number of workers in the unit want the union to conduct collective bargaining on their behalf or if the CAC is not satisfied that a majority of the workers in the unit are members of the union, there are elaborate provisions in the Schedule for the holding of a ballot by the CAC: see paragraphs 22 onwards.",

Thirdly, at each stage of the process, there are strict deadlines set for the employer to respond to applications and offers from the union, with the CAC able to step in to break any foot-dragging by the employer either before or after the method of collective bargaining has been established. For example, the employer cannot simply resile from the bargaining process on the grounds that it no longer believes that the unit is appropriate: paragraph 66 of Schedule A1. One can see that the drafter of the Method Order has tried to anticipate all obstructive tactics that an employer might try to use. Paragraphs 24 and 25 of the Schedule to the Method Order provides that the employer must make available to the union side of the JNB &#8220;such typing, copying and word-processing facilities as it needs to conduct its business in private&#8221; and must set aside a room for the exclusive use of the union side of the JNB complete with a secure cabinet and a telephone.",

From the end of the nineteenth century until the 1980s it was the policy of all governments to promote collective bargaining. The Conciliation Act 1896 (following a Royal Commission in 1891) aimed to promote negotiated settlement of industrial disputes which occurred when collective bargaining failed to reach agreement. The  Trade Boards Act 1909  imposed mandatory collective bargaining in specified industries. The sectors covered by these bodies, subsequently called Wages Councils, were progressively extended, particularly after the First World War, culminating in the Wages Councils Act 1976. Policy changed following the election of a Conservative government in 1979 and in 2013 the last of the Wages Councils, the Agricultural Wages Board, was abolished.

Other mechanisms stimulated collective bargaining such as the Fair Wages Resolutions of the House of Commons, and the extension of collective agreements to non-parties under the Industrial Disputes Order 1951 (SI 1951/1305) re-enacted in later legislation. Obligations were placed on nationalised industries to bargain collectively in the legislation establishing those industries.

That case law should therefore be reconsidered because the interests of legal certainty should not prevent the Court from taking a dynamic and evolutive approach or operate as a bar to reform or improvement: para 153. In taking this step, the Court referred to ILO Conventions No 98 of 1949 concerning the Right to Organise and to Bargain Collectively and No 151 of 1978 concerning Protection of the Right to Organise and Procedures for Determining Conditions of Employment in the Public Service, to the European Social Charter, the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights and the practice in the vast majority of European States (para 151).

But, at the risk of spelling out the obvious, it does not follow from that that article 11 confers a universal right on any trade union to be recognised in all circumstances. It is self-evident that any right to be recognised conferred by domestic law will have to be defined by rules which identify which unions should be recognised by which employers in respect of which workers and for what purposes.

That appeal concerned the dismissal by way of collective redundancy of parks constables who policed the borough&#8217;s parks and open spaces. One issue in the case was whether they were employed in the &#8220;police service&#8221; and hence excluded from the protections afforded to employees by sections 188 &#8211; 192 TULRCA. Those provisions impose a duty on an employer in certain circumstances to consult an appropriate representative; confer a right on a trade union to bring proceedings for breach of that duty; and provide for the making of a &#8220;protective award&#8221; to employees in respect of whom the union had been entitled to be consulted. The claimants argued that such exclusion would be in breach of their article 11 rights. The Court noted at para 60 that the Secretary of State had not offered any justification for the exclusion of parks police from the scope of the provisions but had put his case squarely on there being no interference with article 11 rights which would require justification. The Court said:   \n\t        \n\t\t   \n\t\t     &#8220;61. \n\t\t     \n\t\t        As to that, the starting point is that since the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in   Demir v Turkey   48 EHRR 54 it has been established that &#8216;the right to bargain collectively with the employer has, in principle, become one of the essential elements&#8217; of the rights afforded by article 11, and that those rights are enjoyed by employees of public authorities as well as by employees in the private sector (subject to article 11.2, as to which see para 64 below): see para 154 of the judgment of the Grand Chamber.&#8221;",

This case raised the issue of whether foster carers engaged by foster service providers were &#8220;workers&#8221; and hence whether the applicant union was a &#8220;trade union&#8221; entitled to be entered on the list of trade unions under  section 3  TULRCA. The Court of Appeal held that they were and that the Certification Officer&#8217;s refusal to list the union had wrongfully deprived it of the right to invoke the Schedule A1 process. This was a significant interference with its article 11 rights. Section 296 was therefore read down to include the foster carers for this purpose. Underhill LJ (with whom Bean and Green LJJ agreed) discussed whether the inability of an unlisted union to invoke the procedure for compulsory recognition was an interference with an article 11 right.

There is no such evolution described. On the contrary, where the Court describes (paras 32 to 38) the scope of Article 6 of the European Social Charter 1961 (ratified by the UK) and how it has been interpreted in successive reports of the European Committee of Social Rights, it notes that this has always fallen short of interpreting it as requiring compulsory collective bargaining. The Court also refers to para 28 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (para 39) and the ILO Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention No 98 of 1949 and to the ILO Collective Bargaining Convention No 154 of 1981 (see paras 40 to 43). In its later discussion of these international norms at paras 61 to 63, the Court confirms that all the international instruments still stopped short of this step.

All he or she has to show, in this regard, is that the discriminatory conduct falls within the scope or ambit of article 8.

Certainly, if the legislation purported to limit Schedule A1 to trade unions the majority of whose members belonged to a certain national or ethnic group, an article 11 worker from an excluded group could well argue that the rights concerned fell within the ambit of article 11 so that article 14 was engaged.
