(Markus was born on 30 September 2002. He began High School (non-advanced) education in Slovakia on 1 September 2018 and completed it in June 2022.) On 1 September 2017 the SSWP decided that Ms Simkova was entitled to UC from 26 July 2017. She was paid the standard allowance and housing costs element with the child element still to be determined. On 8 September 2017 the SSWP accepted that she had a permanent right to reside in the United Kingdom. On 25 September 2017 the SSWP, who was aware that Markus was being schooled in Slovakia, decided to award the child element and arrears of child element were paid to Ms Simkova. On 17 October 2019, however, the SSWP revised the decision that Ms Simkova was entitled to the child element. This is the decision challenged in these proceedings.",

Ms Simkova appealed to the First-tier Tribunal which on 19 August 2020 allowed the appeal and awarded the child element from 12 September 2017. The SSWP appealed to the Upper Tribunal. In her response to the appeal, Ms Simkova accepted that the First-tier Tribunal misapplied the UC Regulations 2013 but submitted that the child element was a family benefit for the purposes of the Coordination Regulation with the result that she was entitled to the child element for different reasons. On 21 February 2023 the Upper Tribunal allowed the SSWP&#8217;s appeal and remade the First-tier Tribunal&#8217;s decision, with the result that from 26 July 2017 entitlement to UC was to be calculated without the child element. Ms Simkova appealed to the Court of Appeal (Lewison, Green and Laing LJJ) which on 26 April 2024 dismissed the appeal. On 9 October 2024 the Supreme Court (Lord Reed, Lord Leggatt and Lady Rose) granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. \n\t   \n\t \n\t \n\t   \n\t     Statutory provisions \n\t     Coordination Regulation (EC) No 883/2004",

As its title suggests, it is a coordinating and not a harmonising measure. The preamble makes this clear. Recital 4 refers to the necessity of respecting the special characteristics of national social security legislation and of drawing up only a system of coordination. Recital 15 states that it is necessary to subject persons moving within the Community to the social security scheme of only one single Member State in order to avoid overlapping of the applicable provisions of national legislation and the complications which could result therefrom. Similarly, recital 17a states that once the legislation of a Member State becomes applicable to a person under the Coordination Regulation, the conditions for affiliation and entitlement to benefits should be defined by the legislation of the competent Member State while respecting Community law. The Coordination Regulation is intended, therefore, to provide conflict of laws rules which determine which Member State is responsible for providing which social security benefits.

It also referred to the consideration of DLA in its decision in  Commission of the European Communities v Parliament and Council of the European Union  ( Case C-299/05 ) [2007] ECR I-8695 where it held that even though that allowance did not have the supplementing of sickness insurance benefits as its essential purpose, it had to be regarded, except so far as concerned its mobility component, as a sickness benefit for the purposes of Regulation No 1408/71.

Once again, the CJEU considered (at para 19) that family credit performed a dual function. First it encouraged workers who were poorly paid to continue working. Secondly, it was intended to meet family expenses.

This provision is now contained in article 70 of the current Coordination Regulation. The CJEU&#8217;s case law on SNCBs is considered further below. Neither party has suggested that UC or any element in it is an SNCB. At this point, it is sufficient to state that it allows Member States to declare certain allowances as SNCBs by listing them in what is now Annex X of the current Coordination Regulation (formerly Annex IIa of Regulation 1408/71). Listing of a benefit is permitted if a benefit provides supplementary, substitute or ancillary cover against the risks covered by the branches of social security referred to in article 3(1) and also guarantees minimum subsistence income having regard to the economic and social situation in the Member State concerned. SNCBs resemble social security in that they are coordinated but resemble social assistance in that they are not exportable. One advantage of such a listing from the point of view of a Member State is that Title III of the Coordination Regulation does not apply to an SNCB which can be subject to a residency test for eligibility. The United Kingdom has not listed UC or any component of it in Annex X. SNCBs are not directly relevant to the issues in this appeal.",

By contrast, it is clear from the scheme and detailed provisions of the  WRA 2012  that the child element of UC is not a free-standing, independent benefit. It is deeply integrated into a generalised, composite benefits scheme and it is UC which constitutes the benefit which must be characterised for the purposes of the Coordination Regulation. Different considerations might apply if the appellant were submitting that there was something abusive about the treatment of the child element as a part of UC.

It appears to have been uncontentious that the underlying family allowance fell within article 3 as a family benefit. It would have been a simple matter, he submitted, for the CJEU to say that the child bonus, as an element of that family allowance, must also be a family benefit covered by the Regulation. But the CJEU did not treat the matter as that straightforward. Instead, it examined the nature of the child bonus itself as a discrete benefit.

The child bonus was introduced in separate legislation.

But the questions referred by the Cour de cassation set out at para 25 of the judgment do not raise the issue of whether the characterisation of the child bonus followed that of the family allowance in those circumstances.

The question was whether the mobility allowance was an invalidity benefit (in which case it could not be withdrawn because of his non-residence) or social assistance (in which case it was not covered by the Regulation and so could be withdrawn when the residence requirement was no longer met). The Court held that the allowance had links with both those categories of schemes (para 12). The allowance had a two-fold function depending on whether or not the claimant was an employed or self-employed person who by reason of his previous occupational activity is already covered by the social security system of the State whose legislation is invoked. If, like Mr Newton, he was, then the benefit &#8220;must be deemed to fall within the field of social security&#8221; but if the person had been subject as an employed or self-employed person exclusively to the legislation of other Member States, it would not. That case did not therefore concern different elements within a single benefit but rather the characterisation of the same benefit as claimed by different classes of people.",
