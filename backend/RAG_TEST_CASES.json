      "text": "The Employment Tribunal erred in failing to consider the application for reconsideration of the correct application for anonymity which the Appellant had made. The Appellant had made two relevant applications for anonymity – the first, dated 14 July 2021, was rejected by the Tribunal in a judgment dated 26 July 2021. The Appellant then made a further application on 4 August 2021 supported by a disability impact statement and medical records. That application was considered by the ET on 9 September 2021, by which point the Appellants claims against her former employer had been compromised. The 4 August 2021 application was rejected by the Tribunal under the terms of a decision issued on 9 September 2021. The Appellant applied for reconsideration of that decision on 17 September 2021. However, when that application was considered by the Tribunal under the terms of a decision issued on 21 March 2022, it was treated not as an application in respect of the decision issued on 9 September 2021 but as one made by reference to the earlier decision of 26 July 2021. To that extent therefore, it appeared that the ET had fallen into error",

To the extent that there is a dispute, it concerns which findings of fact are binding, and which are not.\n\t\t  \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t  26.\n\t\t  \n\t\t    To resolve what facts remain binding, it is necessary, first, to finally determine what matters have been remitted. Whilst I have sought, at some length, to assist the parties with this, and whilst I have set out my understanding, that provisional ruling remains subject to any submissions by the parties. The determination of the scope of remission is for the tribunal that hears the remitted claim. It is for that tribunal, as a tribunal, to determine what claims have been remitted. When that process has been undertaken, it will be necessary for the tribunal to understand, having regard to the reason for remission, what effect it has, if any, on all or any of the findings of fact of the Tayler tribunal. Put simply, the tribunal that hears the remitted claim must decide which of the findings of fact are disturbed, and which are not.\n\t\t  \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t  27.\n\t\t  \n\t\t    It is possible that all of the findings of fact remain binding. I have previously noted that the remission appears to revolve around matters treated as facts by the Tayler tribunal, but for which there was no evidence, or at least there was a failure to properly identify the contention that stereotypes exist and put the contention to any witness. It appears the EAT found that the Tayler tribunal either directly relied on those erroneous facts or drew impermissible secondary inferences. However, none of that, necessarily, undermines the findings of fact made by the Tayler Tribunal legitimately based on the evidence presented.\n\t\t  \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t  \n\t\t    …\n\t\t  \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t  30.\n\t\t  \n\t\t    I have considered whether determining what facts are binding could be some form of the preliminary issue. I find that preliminary issues can incorporate matters of evidence and findings of fact. For example, there may be a dispute as to whether certain evidence is admissible. It may be appropriate for a ruling on admissibility to be made prior to a hearing. The effect may be, ultimately, to determine the claim. That would be a preliminary issue.\n\t\t  \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t  31.\n\t\t  \n\t\t    Specific discrete facts are often found by way preliminary issue, for example, the date of dismissal. Whilst those facts may be disputed, they can be resolved at a preliminary hearing, by way of a preliminary issue, by a judge sitting alone. However, the more ingrained the disputed facts are with the issues in the case, the less suitable is the matter for resolution as a preliminary issue. In this case, what facts remain binding at the remitted hearing cannot be excised, as some form of preliminary issue, from the main determination of the claim. What facts remain binding is fundamental to the resolution of this claim and should not be dealt with as a preliminary issue.\n\t\t  \n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t  32.\n\t\t  \n\t\t    It follows from what I have said that the order sought at paragraph 14 of the application is not one which can be determined as a matter of case management, and it is not one which should be determined as a preliminary issue. It must be determined by the final tribunal.”",

Such a ruling would fundamentally affect the rights of both parties to rely on findings of fact. It is common ground that at least some of the findings of fact are binding. To the extent that there is a dispute, it concerns which findings of fact are binding, and which are not.",

I emphasise the word “generally” because that will not always be the case: there can be instances in which a fresh hearing could be directed in respect of a certain aspect of a claim, or in respect of a limited number of issues relatingto that claim.  However, if that is the case, the terms of the order and/or the judgment would, ordinarily, make that clear.  There is no such limitation here and, in fact, the terms of the judgment to which I have just referred make it clear that the stereotypical assumptions aspect of the decision is not something that can simply be hived off for another judge to determine, relying on the facts (or the primary facts) found by the Tayler Tribunal.",
