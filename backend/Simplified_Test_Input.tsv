UKSC Majority	Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100.xml	You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who then in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.
UKSC Majority	Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100.xml	The grounds of action may be as various and manifold as human errancy and the conception of legal responsibility may develop in adaptation to altering social conditions and standards. The criterion of judgment must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life. The categories of negligence are never closed.
Tribunal Majority	Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3.xml	A right of privacy or, as it has been put, a right "to be let alone" can never be absolute. There are many acts done in private which the State is entitled to condemn, whether such be done by an individual on his own or with another.
Tribunal Majority	McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2.xml	The private morality of its citizens does not justify intervention by the State into the activities of those citizens unless and until the common good requires it.
UKSC Majority	McLoughlin v O'Brian [1982] UKHL 3.xml	My Lords, I have no doubt that this is an area of the law of negligence where we should resist the temptation to try yet once more to freeze the law in a rigid posture which would deny justice to some who, in the application of the classic principles of negligence derived from Donoghue v. Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562, ought to succeed, in the interests of certainty, where the very subject matter is uncertain and continuously developing, or in the interests of saving defendants and their insurers from the burden of having sometimes to resist doubtful claims.
UKSC Majority	McLoughlin v O'Brian [1982] UKHL 3.xml	"There remains, in my opinion, just because ""shock"" in its nature is capable of affecting so wide a range of people, a real need for the law to place some limitation upon the extent of admissible claims.
Tribunal Majority	Ann Kelly v Fergus Hennessy [1995] 3 IR 253.xml	The acts of negligence on the part of the defendant which occasioned the injuries to her husband and two daughters occurred out of sight and earshot of the plaintiff. However, the law permits of the recovery of damages for nervous shock and psychiatric illness induced thereby where a plaintiff comes on the immediate aftermath of the accident.
Tribunal Majority	Ann Kelly v Fergus Hennessy [1995] 3 IR 253.xml	"In this case, the learned trial judge used the legal term ""nervous shock"" which is recognised legal terminology for a medically recognised psychiatric illness resulting from shock. On the facts as found by the learned trial judge, on the evidence before the Court, in view of the concession (quite rightly ni my view) by counsel that the plaintiff did have post-traumatic stress disorder, ni view of her proximity in relationship, space and time, and in view of the principles in Hay v. O'Grady [1992] 1I.R. 210 it is not open to this Court to interfere with the decision.
