This is an approach which one can see very clearly from the way in which Lord Atkin stated the neighbour principle in Donoghue v. Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562. 580: “ persons who are so closely and directly a8ected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them"	"McLoughlin v O'Brian [1982] UKHL 3"	"[p137] in contemplation as being so affected.... ” This is saying that foresee- ability must be accompanied and limited by the law's judgment as to persons who ought. according to its standards of value or justice, to have been in contemplation. Foreseeability, which involves a hypothetical person, looking with hindsight at an event which has occurred, is a formula adopted by English law, not merely for defining, but also for limiting, the persons to whom duty may be owed, and the consequences for which an actor may be held responsible. It is not merely an issue of fact to be left"	"McLoughlin v O'Brian [1982] UKHL 3"	"[p162] Finally, and by way of reinforcement of “ aftermath ” cases. I would accept. by analogy with “ rescue ” situations, that a person of whom it could be said that one could expect nothing else than that he or she would come immediately to the scene—normally a parent or a spous ould be regarded as being within the scope of foresight and duty. Where there is not immediate presence, account must be taken of the possibility of alterations in the circumstances, for which the defendant should not be responsible. Subject only to these qualifications, I think that a strict test of proximity by sight or hearing should be applied by the courts."	"McLoughlin v O'Brian [1982] UKHL 3"	"[p177] L.J. at p. 623, to those “ on the road or near to it who may be directly affected by the bad driving. It is not owed to those who are nowhere near the scene.” The most striking feature in the present case is that such limits on the duty of care were imposed notwithstanding the unanimous conclusion of the Court of Appeal that it was reasonably foreseeable (and even “ readily ” so in the judgment of Griffiths L.J.) that injury by shock could be caused to a person in the position of the appellant."	"McLoughlin v O'Brian [1982] UKHL 3"	"[p336] will aid in the resolution of such an issue as the instant one. We note, first, that we deal here with a case in which plainti8 su8ered a shock which resulted in physical injury and we confine our ruling to that case. In determining, in such a case. whether defendant should reasonably foresee the injury to plainti8, or, in other terminology. whether defendant owes plaintiff a duty of due care, the courts will take into account such factors as the following: (1) Whether plainti8 was located near the scene of the accident as contrasted with one who was a distance away from it. (2) Whether the shock resulted from a direct emotional impact upon plainti8 from the sensory and contemporaneous observance of the accident, as contrasted with learning of the accident from others after its occurrence. (3) Whether plainti8 and the victim were closely related, as contrasted with an absence of any relationship or the presence of only a distant relation-ship. The evaluation of these factors will indicate the degree of the defendant's foreseeability: obviously defendant is more likely to fore-see that a mother who observes an accident a8ecting her child will su8er harm than to foretell that a stranger witness will do so. Similarly. the degree of foreseeability of the third person's injury is far greater in the case of his contemporaneous observance of the accident than that in which he subsequently learns of it. The defendant is more likely to foresee that shock to the nearby, witnessing mother will cause physical harm than to anticipate that someone distant from the accident will suffer more than a temporary emotional reaction. All these elements, of course, shade into each other: the fixing of obligation, intimately tied into the facts, depends upon each case. In light of these factors the court will determine whether the accident and harm was reasonably foreseeable. Such reasonable foreseeability does not turn on whether the particular plaintiff as an individual would have in actuality foreseen the exact accident and loss: it contemplates that"	"McLoughlin v O'Brian [1982] UKHL 3"	"[p248] v.

In Poe v. Ullman (1961) 367 U.S. 497 at p. 552 of the report Harlan J. said: -""The family ... is not beyond regulation,' Prince v. Massachusetts (1944) 321 U.S. 158 supra, and it would be an absurdity to suggest either that offenses may not be committed in the bosom of the family or that the home can be made a sanctuary for crime. The right of privacy most manifestly is not an absolute. (McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2)"	"McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2"	"[p136] Thus, I would not suggest that adultery, homosexuality, fornication and incest are immune from criminal enquiry, however privately practiced. So much has been explicitly recognized in acknowledging the State's rightful concern for its people's moral welfare ... Adultery, homosexuality and the like are sexual intimacies which the State forbids altogether, but the intimacy of husband and wife is necessarily an essential and accepted feature of the institution of marriage, an institution which the State not only must allow, but which always and in every age it has fostered and protected."	"McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2"	"[p54] But when this is a code governing private morality and where the breach of it is not one which injures the common good then it is not the State’s business to intervene. It is outside the authority of the State to endeavour to intrude into the privacy of the husband and wife relationship for the sake of imposing a code of private morality upon that husband and wife which they do not desire."	"McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2"	"[p49] What may be permissible to the husband and wife is not necessarily permissible to the State. For example, the husband and wife may mutually agree to practice either total or partial abstinence in their sexual relations. If the State were to attempt to intervene to compel such abstinence, it would be an intolerable and unjustifiable intrusion into the privacy of the matrimonial bedroom. On the other hand, any action on the part of either the husband and wife or of the State to limit family sizes by endangering or destroying human life must necessarily not only be an offence against the common good but also against the guaranteed personal rights of the human life in question."	"McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2"	"[p108]  At p. 499 Goldberg J. cites with approval the words of Harlan J. in Poe v. Ullman (1961) 367 U.S. 497, at 553:‑ “… the intimacy of husband and wife is necessarily an essential and accepted feature of the institution of marriage, an institution which the State not only must allow, but which always and in every age it has fostered and protected. It is one thing when the State exerts its power either to forbid extra-marital sexuality altogether, or to say who may marry, but it is quite another when, having acknowledged a marriage and the intimacies inherent in it, it undertakes to regulate by means of the criminal law the details of that intimacy."""	"McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2"	"[p105] Section 17, in my judgment, so far from respecting the plaintiff's personal rights, violates them. If she observes this prohibition (which in practice she can scarcely avoid doing and which in law she is bound under penalty of fine and imprisonment to do), she will endanger the security and happiness of her marriage, she will imperil her health to the point of hazarding her life, and she will subject her family to the risk of distress and disruption. These are intrusions which she is entitled to say are incompatible with the safety of her life, the preservation of her health, her responsibility to her conscience, and the security and well being of her marriage and family. If she fails to obey the prohibition in s. 17, the law, by prosecuting her, will reach into the privacy of her marital life in seeking to prove her guilt."	"McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2"	"[p50] The sexual life of a husband and wife is of necessity and by its nature an area of particular privacy. If the husband and wife decide to limit their family or to avoid having children by use of contraceptives, it is a matter peculiarly within the joint decision of the husband and wife and one into which the State cannot intrude unless its intrusion e justified by the exigencies of the common good. The question of whether the use of contraceptives by married couples within their marriage is or is not contrary to the moral code or codes to which they profess to subscribe, or is or is not regarded by them as being against their conscience, could not justify State intervention."	"McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2"	"[p139] Does a law which - effectively prevents the plaintiff and her husband in their particular circumstances from resorting to the use of contraceptives for the purpose of ensuring that the plaintiff will not have another pregnancy ""respect"" or ""not interfere with"" the right of family privacy of the plaintiff and her husband?"" In this context, I wish to emphasise that this judgment is confined to contraceptives as such; it is not intended to apply to abortifacients, though called contraceptives, as in the case of abortifacients entirely different considerations may arise. In my opinion, a statute which makes it a criminal offence for the plaintiff or her husband to import or to acquire possession of contraceptives for use within their marriage is an unjustifiable invasion of privacy in the conduct of the most intimate of all their personal relationships."	"McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2"	"[p51] Similarly the fact that the use of contraceptives may offend against the moral code of the majority of the citizens of the State would not per se justify an intervention by the State to prohibit their use within marriage. The private morality of its citizens does not justify intervention by the State into the activities of those citizens unless and until the common good requires it counsel for the Attorney General did not seek to argue that the State would have any right to seek to prevent the use of contraceptives within marriage."	"McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2"	"[p137] It is one thing when the State exerts its power either to forbid extra-marital sexuality altogether, or to say who may marry, but it is quite another when, having acknowledged a marriage and the intimacies inherent in it, it undertakes to regulate by means of the criminal law the details of that intimacy.""

Here, in so far as the law and the State are concerned, he asserts a “no go area” in the field of private morality. I do not accept this view either as a general philosophical proposition concerning the purpose of law or as having particular reference to a right of privacy under our Constitution. I regard the State as having an interest in the general moral well being of the community and as being entitled, where it is practicable to do so, to discourage conduct which is morally wrong and harmful to a way of life and to values which the State wishes to protect (Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3)"	"Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3"	"[p36] “There remains one additional counter argument which we believe to be decisive, namely, the importance which society and the law ought to give to individual freedom of choice in action in matters of private morality. Unless a deliberate attempt is to be made by society, acting through the agency of the law, to equate the sphere of crime with that of sin, there must remain a realm of private morality and immorality, which is, in brief and crude terms not the law’s business. To say this is not to condone or encourage private immorality.”"	"Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3"	"[p35] I now turn to what I have described as the core of the plaintiff’s case. This is the claim that the impugned legislation constitutes an unwarranted interference with his private life and thereby infringes his right to privacy. This claim is based on the philosophical view, attributed to John Stuart Mill, that the law should not concern itself in the realm of private morality except to the extent necessary for the protection of public order and the guarding of citizens against injury or exploitation. It is a view which received significant endorsement in the report of the Wolfenden Committee on Homosexual Offences and Prostitution. That committee’s report, furnished to the British Parliament in 1957, contained the following statement in support of its recommendation for limited decriminalisation:-"	"Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3"	"[p54] A right of privacy or, as it has been put, a right “to be let alone” can never be absolute. There are many acts done in private which the State is entitled to condemn, whether such be done by an individual on his own or with another. The law has always condemned abortion, incest, suicide attempts, suicide pacts, euthanasia or mercy killing. These are prohibited simply because they are morally wrong and regardless of the fact, which may exist in some instances, that no harm or injury to others is involved. With homosexual conduct, the matter is not so simple or clear. Such conduct is, of course, morally wrong, and has been so regarded by mankind through the centuries. It cannot be said of it, however, as the plaintiff seeks to say, that no harm is done if it is conducted in private by consenting males. Very serious harm may in fact he involved. Such conduct, although carried on with full consent, may lead a mildly homosexually orientated person into a way of life from which he may never recover. As already indicated, known consequences are frustration, loneliness arid even suicide. In addition, it is clearly established that an increase in the practice of homosexuality amongst males increases the incidence of all forms of venereal disease, including the incapacitating and often fatal disease of syphilis. Surely, in the light of such possible consequences, no one could regard with equanimity the freeing of such conduct from all legal restraints with the certain result that it would increase and its known devotees multiply. These, however, are not the only considerations."	"Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3"	"[p31] The plaintiff’s case examined At the core of the plaintiff’s challenge to the impugned legislation is the assertion that the State has no business in the field of private morality and has no right to legislate in relation to the private sexual conduct of consenting adults. It is the plaintiff’s case that to attempt to do so is to exceed the limits of permissible interference and to shatter that area of privacy which the dignity and liberty of human persons require to be kept apart as a haven for each citizen. Accordingly, the plaintiff says that any legislation which purports to do so is de facto inconsistent with the Constitution. Apart from this, however, the plaintiff has advanced other grounds of alleged inconsistency which must be considered. I propose in the first place to deal with these other grounds and then to return to what appears to be the plaintiff’s main submission."	"Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3"	"[p111] The learned judge (who dealt with this difficult case with commendable thoroughness), in substituting his own conclusions on the personal and societal effects of the questioned provisions, seems to have laid undue stress on the fact that the prohibited acts, especially sodomy, are contrary to the standards of morality advocated by the Christian Churches in this State. With respect, I do not think that should be treated as a guiding consideration. What are known as the seven deadly sins are anathematised as immoral by all the Christian Churches, and it would have to be conceded that they are capable, in different degrees and in certain contexts, of undermining vital aspects of the common good. Yet it would be neither constitutionally permissible nor otherwise desirable to seek by criminal sanctions to legislate their commission out of existence in all possible circumstances. To do so would upset the necessary balance which the Constitution posits between the common good and the dignity and freedom of the individual. What is deemed necessary to his dignity and freedom by one man may be abhorred by another as an exercise in immorality. The pluralism necessary for the preservation of constitutional requirements in the Christian, democratic State envisaged by the Constitution means that the sanctions of the criminal law may be attached to immoral acts only when the common good requires their proscription as crimes. As the most eminent theologians have conceded, the removal of the sanction of the criminal law from an immoral act does not necessarily imply an approval or condonation of that act. Here the consensus of the evidence was that the sweep of the criminal prohibition contained in the questioned provisions goes beyond the requirements of the common good; indeed, in the opinion of most of the witnesses it is inimical to the common good. Consequently, a finding of unconstitutionality was inescapable on the evidence."	"Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3"	"[p56] On the ground of the Christian nature of our State and on the grounds that the deliberate practice of homosexuality is morally wrong, that it is damaging to the health both of individuals and the public and, finally, that it is potentially harmful to the institution of marriage, I can find no inconsistency with the Constitution in the laws which make such conduct criminal. It follows, in my view, that no right of privacy, as claimed by the plaintiff, can prevail against the operation of such criminal sanctions."	"Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3"	"[p21] In so far as the impugned legislation seeks to control the sexual conduct of the plaintiff and like-minded citizens, carried on in private, the plaintiff claims that it constitutes an unwarranted intrusion into his private life, and is inconsistent with the State’s duty to defend and vindicate his right to privacy which is one of his personal rights as a citizen."	"Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3"	"[p182] I refer to these particular examples to seek to illustrate the problem that arises if a testis related to what may be generalised as compelling State interest. The term “compelling State interest” is commonly used, particularly in the United States, in cases depending on the claim to privacy. It is self evident that such interest is overwhelming in the protection of minors, persons under incapacity of one kind or another, public decency, discipline in the armed forces or the security forces and so on. But what is the test in circumstances where none of these obvious instances of compelling State interest apply? The Chief Justice has touched upon the alleged greater spread of venereal diseases but I do not accept that the State has discharged in any way a burden of proof of establishing that such a circumstance amounts to a compelling State interest. I join with Mr. Justice Henchy in the observations he has made in his judgment on the failure of the Attorney General, with all the resources at his disposal, to call any evidence whatever to displace the impressive body of evidence called on behalf of the plaintiff. Subject to the matters that I have already instanced, in my opinion a very great burden lies upon those who would question personal rights in order to justify State interference of a most grievous kind (the policeman in the bedroom) in a claim to the right to perform sexual acts or to give expression to sexual desires or needs in private between consenting adults, male or female."	"Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3"	"[p59] 2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”"	"Norris v A.G.

The liability for negligence, whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a species of “culpa,” is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay. But acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot in a practical world be treated so as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief."	"Ann Kelly v Fergus Hennessy [1995] 3 IR 253"	"[p32] A.C. 410 Lord Bridge of Harwich stated:- “The judges, in all the decisions we have been referred to, have assumed that it lay within their own competence to determine whether the plaintiff s ‘nervous shock’ (as lawyers quaintly persist in calling it) was in any given circumstances a sufficiently foreseeable consequence of the defendant's act or omission relied on as negligent to bring the plaintiff within the scope of those to whom the defendant owed a duty of care.”"	"Ann Kelly v Fergus Hennessy [1995] 3 IR 253"	"[p124] Lord Ormidale thus finds himself constrained to reach a conclusion which appears to him to be contrary to reason and equity by his reading of what he describes as an ""unbroken and consistent current of decisions beginning with Winterbottom v. Wright ."" In view of the deference thus paid to English precedents it is a singular fact that the case of Winterbottom v. Wright is one in which no negligence in the sense of breach of a duty owed by the defendant to the plaintiff was alleged on the part of the defendant. The truth, as I hope to show, is that there is in the English reports no such ""unbroken and consistent current of decisions"" as would justify the aspersion that the law of England has committed itself irrevocably to what is neither reasonable nor equitable, or require a Scottish judge in following them to do violence to his conscience. ""In my opinion,"" said Lord Esher in Emmens v. Pottle, 1885, 16 Q.B.D., 354 at pp. 357-8, ""any proposition the result of which would be to show that the common law of England is wholly unreasonable and unjust cannot be part of the common law of England."""	"Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100"	"[p82] I have already pointed out that this distinction is unfounded in fact, for in Elliott v. Hall as in Hawkins v. Smith (the defective sack) the defendant exercised no control over the article and the accident did not occur on his premises. With all respect I think that the judgments in the case err by seeking to confine the law to rigid and exclusive categories: and by not giving sufficient attention to the general principle which governs the whole law of negligence in the duty owed to those who will be immediately injured by lack of care."	"Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100"	"[p85] My Lords, I do not find it necessary to discuss at length the cases dealing with duties where a thing is dangerous, or in the narrower category belongs to a class of things which are dangerous in themselves. I regard the distinction as an unnatural one so far as it is used to serve as a logical differentiation by which to distinguish the existence or non-existence of a legal right. In this respect I agree with what was said by Scrutton, L. J., in Hope & Son v. Anglo American Oil Co. (1922), 12 Lloyds List 183 at p. 187, a case which was ultimately decided on a question of fact: ""Personally I do not understand the difference between a thing dangerous in itself as poison, and a thing not dangerous as a class but by negligent construction dangerous as a particular thing. The latter if anything seems the more dangerous of the two : it is a wolf in sheep's clothing instead of an obvious wolf."""	"Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100"	"[p120] I desire to draw special attention to certain passages in the opinions of their Lordships. At p. 470 the learned Lord Justice Clerk states that he prefers "" to base his judgment on the proposition that the pursuer has failed to prove fault on the part of the defenders"" and feels "" absolved from expressing a concluded opinion on the thorny and difficult question of law whether, assuming fault to be proved on the part of the defenders, the pursuer has in law a right to sue them."""	"Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100"	"[p27] ""The recognised cases"" to which the Master of the Rolls refers are not definitely quoted, but they appear to refer to cases of collision and carriage and the cases of visitation to premises on which there is some hidden danger, cases far removed from the doctrine he enunciates. None the less this passage has been used as a tabula in naufragio for many litigants struggling in the seas of adverse authority. It cannot, however, be divorced from the fact that the case had nothing whatever to do"	"Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100"	"[p151] The law takes no cognisance of carelessness in the abstract. It concerns itself with carelessness only where there is a duty to take care and where failure in that duty has caused damage. In such circumstances carelessness assumes the legal quality of negligence and entails the consequences in law of negligence. What then are the circumstances which give rise to this duty to take care ? In the daily contacts of social and business life human beings are thrown into or place themselves in an infinite variety of relationships with their fellows and the law can refer only to the standards of the reasonable man in order to determine whether any particular relationship gives rise to a duty to take care as between those who stand in that relationship to each other. The grounds of action may be as various and manifold as human errancy and the conception of legal responsibility may develop in adaptation to altering social conditions and standards. The criterion of judgment must adjust and adapt itself to the changing circumstances of life. The categories of negligence are never closed."	"Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100"	"[p78] Mathew, L.J., appears to me to put the case on its proper footing when he says at p. 259 the argument of the Plaintiff was that the Defendant's servants had been negligent in the performance of the contract with the owners of the van and that it followed as a matter of law that any one in this employment had a cause of action against the Defendant. "" It is impossible to accept such a wide proposition and indeed it is difficult to see how if it were the law trade could be carried on."" I entirely agree. I have no doubt that in that case the Plaintiff failed to show that the repairer owed any duty to him. The question of law in that case seems very different to that raised in the present case. The case of Blacker v. Lake & Elliot Ltd. 1912 (104 L.T. 533) approaches more nearly the facts of this case. I have read and re-read it having unfeigned respect for the authority of the two learned judges, Hamilton and Lush, J.J., who decided it: and I am bound to say I have found difficulty in formulating the precise grounds upon which the judgment was given."

A plaintiff must establish that his or her recognisable psychiatric illness was “shock-induced”. This principle was enunciated in the Australian case of Jaensch v.Coffey (1984) 155 C.L.R. 549, by Brennan J. as follows:- “A plaintiff may recover only if the psychiatric illness is the result of physical injury inflicted on him by the defendant or if it is induced by shock. Psychiatric illness caused in other ways attracts no damages, though it is reasonably foreseeable that psychiatric illness might be a consequence of the defendant's carelessness.”"	"Ann Kelly v Fergus Hennessy [1995] 3 IR 253"	"[p71] “Nervous shock” is a mental injury, being a recognisable and distinct psychiatric illness: Hinz v.

"Ann Kelly v Fergus Hennessy [1995] 3 IR 253"	"[p43] In the last analysis any policy consideration seems to be rooted in a fear of floodgates opening - the tacit question “What next?” I am not impressed by that fear - certainly not sufficiently to deprive this plaintiff of just compensation for the reasonably foreseeable damage done to her. I do not consider that such deprivation is justified by trying to answer in advance the question posed “What next?” by a consideration of relationships of plaintiff to the sufferers or deceased, or other circumstances: to attempt in advance solutions, or even guidelines, in hypothetical cases may well, it seems to me, in this field, do more harm than good. I also would allow this appeal.”"	"Ann Kelly v Fergus Hennessy [1995] 3 IR 253"	"[p31] “It is not necessary for a plaintiff to prove that a reasonable man in the defendant's position could foresee that any particular psychiatric illness might be caused by his conduct: it suffices that he could have foreseen that his conduct might cause some recognised psychiatric illness by shock.”"	"Ann Kelly v Fergus Hennessy [1995] 3 IR 253"	"[p80] First, to take the common sense approach. The illness in question arises as a result of a shock, of exposure to a trauma far outside the usual range of experience. There is no doubt that the accident exposed the plaintiff to such a trauma."

The nervous shock sustained by a plaintiff must be by reason of actual or apprehended physical injury to the plaintiff or a person other than the plaintiff. This view was clearly expressed by Deane J. in Jaensch v. Coffey (1984) 115 C.L.R. 549 as being the present state of the law when he said that a duty of care (and hence liability for nervous shock) will not exist unless “the reasonably foreseeable psychiatric injury was sustained as a result of the death, injury or peril of someone other than the person whose carelessness caused the injury”.
