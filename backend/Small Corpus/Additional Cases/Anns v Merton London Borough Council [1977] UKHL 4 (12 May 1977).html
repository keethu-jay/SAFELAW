of 3' 0&quot; or deeper as shown on the deposited plans. On<BR>21st
February 1972 writs were issued against both defendants&mdash;the
separate<BR>proceedings were later consolidated. As against the first
defendants (the<BR>builders) the claims were for damages for breach
of contract and also for<BR>breach of the implied undertaking under
section 6 of the Housing Act 1957.<BR>As against the council the
claims were for damages for negligence by their<BR>servants or agents
in approving the foundations upon which the block was<BR>erected even
though (sic) they had not been taken down to a sufficient
depth<BR>and/or in failing to inspect the said foundations. This

the negligence of the Second Defandants in allowing the First
Defendants<BR>&quot; to construct the said dwelling house upon
foundations which were only<BR>&quot; 2' 6&quot; deep instead of 3
feet or deeper as required by the said plans,<BR>&quot; alternatively

Lane, L.JJ.) in<BR><I>Sparham-Souter v. Town and Country Developments
(Essex) Ltd. </I>[1976] 1 Q.B.<BR>858 decided that the cause of
action did not accrue before a person capable of<BR>suing discovered,
or ought to have discovered, the damage. Lord Denning,<BR>M.R. in his
judgment expressly disavowed his earlier dictum in <I>Button's

plaintiffs' claims would be<BR>statute barred. On the appeals in the
present case coming before the Court<BR>of Appeal on 1st March 1976,
that court, without further argument, following<BR><I>Sparham-Souter's
</I>case, allowed the plaintiffs' appeal and gave leave to appeal<BR>to
this House. That appeal would, of course, have been confined to a

of<BR>Appeal, because it was thought, rightly in my opinion, that it
was concluded by<BR><I>Button's </I>case. Thus the council wished to
challenge the correctness of the<BR>latter decision. In that case the
defendant Council of Bognor Regis was held<BR>liable for damages in
negligence (viz., negligent inspection by one of its
officers),<BR>consisting of a breach of a duty at common law to take
reasonable care to see<BR>that the byelaws were complied with. On
21st October 1976 this House<BR>acceded to the petition. The

been reached that in order to establish that a duty of care arises in
a<BR>particular situation, it is not necessary to bring the facts of
that situation<BR>within those of previous situations in which a duty
of care has been held to<BR>exist. Rather the question has to be
approached in two stages. First one<BR>has to ask whether, as between
the alleged wrongdoer and the person who has<BR>suffered damage there
is a sufficient relationship of proximity or neighbourhood<BR>such
that, in the reasonable contemplation of the former, carelessness on
his<BR>part may be likely to cause damage to the latter&mdash;in
which case a <I>prima facie<BR></I>duty of care arises. Secondly, if
the first question is answered affirmatively,<BR>it is necessary to
consider whether there are any considerations which ought<BR>to
negative, or to reduce or limit the scope of the duty or the class of
person<BR>to whom it is owed or the damages to which a breach of it
may give rise (see<BR><I>Dorset Yacht </I>case, <I>loc. </I>cit., p.
1027 per Lord Reid). Examples of this are<BR><I>Hedley Byrne </I>where

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">To
summarise the statutory position. The Public Health Act 1936,
in<BR>particular Part II, was enacted in order to provide for the
health and safety<BR>of owners and occupiers of buildings, including
dwelling houses, by <I>(inter<BR>alia) </I>setting standards to be
complied with in construction, and by enabling<BR>local authorities,
through building byelaws, to supervise and control the<BR>operations
of builders. One of the particular matters within the area of
local<BR>authority supervision is the foundations of
buildings&mdash;clearly a matter of<BR>vital importance, particularly
because this part of the building comes to be<BR>covered up as
building proceeds. Thus any weakness or inadequacy will<BR>create a
hidden defect which whoever acquires the building has no means
of<BR>discovering: in legal parlance there is no opportunity for
intermediate inspection.<BR>So, by the byelaws, a definite standard
is set for foundation work (see byelaw<BR>18(1)<I>(b)</I> referred to
above): the builder is under a statutory (sc. byelaw) duty<BR>to
notify the local authority before covering up the foundations: the
local<BR>authority has at this stage the right to inspect and to
insist on any correction<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

which in the future may cause damage<BR>to the building affecting the

is the extent of the local authority's duty towards these
persons?<BR>Although, as I have suggested, a situation of &quot;
proximity &quot; existed between<BR>the council and owners and
occupiers of the houses, I do not think that a<BR>description of the
council's duty can be based upon the &quot; neighbourhood &quot;<BR>principle
alone or upon merely any such factual relationship as &quot;
control&quot;<BR>as suggested by the Court of Appeal. So to base it
would be to neglect an<BR>essential factor which is that the local
authority is a public body, discharging<BR>functions under statute:
its powers and duties are definable in terms of public<BR>not private
law. The problem which this type of action creates, is to define<BR>the
circumstances in which the law should impose, over and above, or
perhaps<BR>alongside, these public law powers and duties, a duty in
private law towards<BR>individuals such that they may sue for damages
in a civil court. It is in this<BR>context that the distinction
sought to be drawn between duties and mere<BR>powers has to be
examined.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Most,
indeed probably all, statutes relating to public authorities or
public<BR>bodies, contain in them a large area of policy. The courts
call this &quot; discretion &quot;<BR>meaning that the decision is
one for the authority or body to make, and not<BR>for the courts.
Many statutes, also prescribe or at least presuppose the<BR>practical
execution of policy decisions: a convenient description of this is
to<BR>say that in addition to the area of policy or discretion, there
is an operational<BR>area. Although this distinction between the
policy area and the operational<BR>area is convenient, and
illuminating, it is probably a distinction of degree;<BR>many &quot;
operational&quot; powers or duties have in them some element of &quot;
dis-<BR>cretion &quot;. It can safely be said that the more &quot;
operational &quot; a power or duty<BR>may be, the easier it is to
superimpose upon it a common law duty of care.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I do not
think that it is right to limit this to a duty to avoid causing
extra<BR>or additional damage beyond what must be expected to arise
from the exercise<BR>of the power or duty. That may be correct when
the act done under the<BR>statute <I>inherently </I>must adversely
<I>affect </I>the interest of individuals. But many<BR>other acts can
be done without causing any harm to anyone&mdash;indeed may
be<BR>directed to preventing harm from occuring. In these cases the

likely to be affected.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Let us
examine the Public Health Act 1936 in the light of this.
Undoubtedly<BR>it lays out a wide area of policy. It is for the local
authority, a public and<BR>elected body, to decide upon the scale of
resources which it can make available<BR>in order to carry out its
functions under Part II of the Act&mdash;how many<BR>inspectors, with
what expert qualifications, it should recruit, how often<BR>inspections
are to be made, what tests are to be carried out, must be for
its<BR>decision. It is no accident that the Act is drafted in terms
of functions and<BR>powers rather than in terms of positive duty. As
was well said, public<BR>authorities have to strike a balance between
the claims of efficiency and thrift<BR>(du Parcq L.J. in <I>Kent v.
East Suffolk Rivera Catchment Board </I>[1940] 1 K.B.<BR>319, 338):
whether they get the balance right can only be decided through
the<BR>ballot box, not in the courts. It is said&mdash;there are
reflections of this in the<BR>judgments in <I>Buttons </I>case&mdash;that
the local authority is under no duty to<BR>inspect, and this is used
as the foundation for an argument, also found in<BR>some of the
cases, that if it need not inspect at all, it cannot be liable
for<BR>negligent inspection: if it were to be held so liable, so it
is said, councils<BR>would simply decide against inspection. I think
that this is too crude an<BR>argument. It overlooks the fact that
local authorities are public bodies<BR>operating under statute with a
clear responsibility for public health in their<BR>area. They must,
and in fact do, make their discretionary decisions responsibly<BR>and
for reasons which accord with the statutory purpose; c.f. <I>Ayr

under a duty to give proper<BR>consideration to the question whether
they should inspect or not. Their<BR>immunity from attack, in the
event of failure to inspect, in other words,<BR>though great is not
absolute. And because it is not absolute, the necessary<BR>premise

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Passing
then to the duty as regards inspection, if made. On principle
there<BR>must surely be a duty to exercise reasonable care. The
standard of care must<BR>be related to the duty to be
performed&mdash;namely to ensure compliance with<BR>the byelaws. It
must be related to the fact that the person responsible
for<BR>construction in accordance with the byelaws is the builder,
and that the<BR>inspector's function is supervisory. It must be
related to the fact that once<BR>the inspector has passed the
foundations they will be covered up, with no<BR>subsequent
opportunity for inspection. But this duty, heavily operational<BR>though
it may be, is still a duty arising under the statute. There may be
a<BR>discretionary element in its exercise&mdash;discretionary as to
the time and manner<BR>of inspection, and the techniques to be used.
A plaintiff complaining of<BR>negligence must prove, the burden being
on him, that action taken was not<BR>within the limits of a
discretion <I>bona fide </I>exercised, before he can begin to<BR>rely
upon a common law duty of care. But if he can do this, he should,

did so with an allocation of manpower and resources<BR>(graphically

K.B. 132. That<BR>concerned a power to light streets and the
corporation decided, for economy<BR>reasons, to extinguish the
lighting on Christmas night. Clearly this was<BR>within the
discretion of the authority but Scrutton L. J. in the Court of
Appeal<BR>contrasted this situation with one where &quot; an option
is given by statute to an<BR>&quot; authority to do or not to do a
thing and it elects to do the thing and does<BR>&quot; it negligently
&quot; (ibid. 145-6). (Compare <I>Indian Towing Co. v. United
States<BR></I>350 U.S. 61, which makes just this distinction between
a discretion to provide<BR>a lighthouse, and at operational level, a
duty, if one is provided, to use due<BR>care to keep the light in
working order). Other illustrations are given.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">My Lords,
a number of reasons were suggested for distinguishing the
<I>East<BR>Suffolk </I>case&mdash;apart from the relevant fact that
it was concerned with a different<BR>Act, indeed type of Act. It was
said to be a decision on causation: I think<BR>that this is true of
at least two of their Lordships (Viscount Simon and Lord<BR>Thankerton).
It was said that the damage was already there before the<BR>Board
came on the scene: so it was but the Board's action or inaction
un-<BR>doubtedly prolonged it, and the action was in respect of the
prolongation. I<BR>should not think it right to put the case aside on
such arguments. To me the<BR>two significant points about the case
are, first, that it is an example, and a<BR>good one, where
operational activity&mdash;at the breach in the wall&mdash;was still
well<BR>within a discretionary area, so that the plaintiff's task in
contending for a duty<BR>of care was a difficult one. This is clearly
the basis on which Lord Romer,<BR>whose speech is often quoted as a
proposition of law, proceeded. Secondly,<BR>although the case was
decided in 1941, only one of their Lordships considered<BR>it in
relation to a duty of care at common law. It need cause no surprise
that<BR>this was Lord Atkin. His speech starts with this passage:</FONT></FONT></P>

the first point &quot; [sc. whether there was a duty owed to the

that the argument<BR>&quot; did not sufficiently distinguish between
two kinds of duties: (1) A<BR>&quot; statutory duty to do or abstain
from doing something, (2) A common<BR>&quot; law duty to conduct
yourself with reasonable care so as not to injure<BR>&quot; persons

of the duty must have been thinking<BR>in terms of that case. My
Lords, I believe that the conception of a general<BR>duty of care,
not limited to particular accepted situations, but
extending<BR>generally over all relations of sufficient proximity,
and even pervading the<BR>sphere of statutory functions of public

may well be that full recognition of the impact<BR>of <I>Donog/nie v.

they were under a duty of care as<BR>regards persons who might suffer

this topic extended consideration<BR>with a view to relating the
officers' responsibility under public law to their<BR>liability in
damages to members of the public under private, civil law. (See<BR>pp.
1064 ff). My noble and learned friend points out that the
accepted<BR>principles which are applicable to powers conferred by a
private Act of<BR>Parliament, as laid down in <I>Geddis v.
Proprietors of Bann Reservoirs, </I>cannot<BR>automatically be
applied to public statutes which confer a large measure of<BR>discretion
upon public authorities. As regards the latter, for a civil
action<BR>based on negligence at common law to succeed, there must be
acts or omissions<BR>taken outside the limits of the delegated
discretion: in such a case &quot;its<BR>&quot; actionability falls to

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">It is for
this reason that the law, as stated in some of the speeches in
the<BR><I>East Suffolk </I>case, but not in those of Lord Atkin or
Lord Thankerton, requires<BR>at the present time to be understood and
applied with the recognition that,<BR>quite apart from such
consequences as may flow from an examination of the<BR>duties laid
down by the particular statute, there may be room, once one
is<BR>outside the area of legitimate discretion or policy, for a duty
of care, at common<BR>law. It is irrelevant to the existence of this
duty of care whether what is<BR>created by the statute is a duty or a
power: the duty of care may exist in<BR>cither case. The difference
between the two lies in this, that, in the case of a<BR>power,
liability cannot exist unless the act complained of lies outside the
ambit<BR>of the power. In the <I>Dorset Yacht Co. </I>case the
officers may (on the assumed<BR>facts) have acted outside any
discretion delegated to them and having dis-<BR>regarded their
instructions as to the precautions which they should take to<BR>prevent
the trainees from escaping (see per Lord Diplock, I.c. p. 1069). So
in<BR>the present case, the allegations made are consistent with the
council or its<BR>inspector having acted outside any delegated
discretion either as to the making<BR>of an inspection, or as to the
manner in which an inspection was made.<BR>Whether they did so must
be determined at the trial. In the event of a positive<BR>determination,
and only so, can a duty of care arise. I respectfully think that<BR>Lord
Denning, M.R. in <I>Duttons </I>case (p. 392) puts the duty too high.</FONT></FONT></P>

can only be conferred upon an owner,<BR>or occupier, who is such when
the damage occurs (see below). This disposes of<BR>the possible

damage to the dwelling-house<BR>itself; for the whole purpose of the

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The seven
maisonettes which comprise the building were to be let on 999 year<BR>
leases at nominal rents and acquired for substantial capital sums.  
The building<BR>inspector and the council who sent him to inspect the
foundations must have<BR>realised that the inspection was of great
importance for the protection of<BR>future occupants of the
maisonettes who indeed might suffer serious damage<BR>if the
inspection was carried out negligently.    The inspection should
have<BR>revealed that this block of maisonettes was about to be
erected on insecure<BR>foundations, that is to say, foundations which
failed to comply with the<BR>approved plans and the byelaws, and that
therefore there was a serious risk<BR>that within a decade the whole
structure would suffer damage and might<BR>indeed collapse.   Nor was
there any likelihood that any survey on behalf of<BR>the original
tenants or their assignees would include an inspection of
the<BR>foundations since they would be concealed by the building.  
The whole<BR>purpose of the inspection on behalf of the council
before the foundations<BR>were covered up was to discover whether the
foundations were secure and to<BR>ensure that if they were not, they
should be made so for the protection of<BR>future tenants before the
building was erected.    It is impossible to think of<BR>anyone more
closely and directly affected by the inspection than the
original<BR>tenants of the maisonettes and their assignees.   I have
therefore come to the<BR>clear conclusion that the council acting
through their building inspector when<BR>he inspected the foundations
owed a duty to the plaintiffs to carry out the<BR>inspection with
reasonable care and skill.   There can, I think, be no doubt<BR>but
that the building inspector failed to use reasonable care and skill
because<BR>the underside of the concrete foundations was only 2' 6&quot;
below ground level,<BR>whereas the plans delivered to the Council
showed the foundations as being<BR>3 feet below ground level or
deeper if required.   A surveyor's report on page<BR>106 of the
Record states that &quot; 3 feet is the accepted minimum depth for<BR>&quot;
foundation excavations, always provided a reasonable bottom is found
at<BR>&quot; that level and in this case we have found the sub-soil
beneath the concrete<BR>&quot; to be of very doubtful and variable
quality, consisting of a mixture of sand<BR>&quot; and gravel with
traces of soft clay.   We are therefore of the opinion that<BR>&quot;
the defects in this property arise from inadequate foundation depth
having<BR>&quot; regard to the site conditions,  and that movement
has probably been<BR>&quot; accentuated by all or any of the
following factors &quot;.   These factors are then<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">It has,
however, been argued on the council's behalf that, since it was
under<BR>no obligation to inspect the foundations, had it failed to
do so, it could not<BR>be liable for the damage caused by the
inadequacy of the foundations.<BR>Accordingly, so the argument runs,
if the council decided to inspect the<BR>foundations in the exercise
of its statutory powers, it owed the prospective<BR>tenants and their
assignees no duty to inspect carefully because, even if
the<BR>inspection was carried out negligently, the prospective
tenants and their<BR>assignees would be no worse off than if there
had been no inspection. I<BR>reject this argument and confess that I
cannot detect that it has even any<BR>superficial attraction. The
council is given these statutory powers to inspect<BR>the foundations
and furnished with public funds to enable the powers to be<BR>used
for the protection of prospective purchasers of the buildings which
are to<BR>be built upon them. If, when the council exercises these
powers, it does so<BR>negligently, it must be obvious that those
members of the public in the position<BR>of the present plaintiffs
are likely to suffer serious damage. The exercise of<BR>power without
responsibility is not encouraged by the law. I recognize that<BR>it
may not be practical to inspect the foundations of every new
building.<BR>This, however, is no excuse for a negligent inspection
of such foundations as<BR>are inspected. When a council exercises its
powers of inspection, it should be<BR>and I believe is responsible in
law to those who suffer damage as a result of<BR>that negligence.</FONT></FONT></P>

way, nor for their inspection<BR>to be negligently carried out. If
the foundations do give way, there is no<BR>warranty by the council
which has inspected them that they are sound. The<BR>council is
responsible only if it has exercised its powers to inspect and
the<BR>defects in the foundations, should have been detected by
reasonable care and<BR>skill. It seems to me to be manifestly fair

of the six years (amended<BR>by the Law Reform (Limitation of
Actions, etc.) Act 1954 to three years in<BR>actions for damages for
personal injuries) from the date when the cause of<BR>action accrued.
Every member of this House in <I>Jopling v</I>. <I>Cartledge
</I>expressed<BR>the view that it was unreasonable and unjust that a
cause of action should be<BR>held to accrue before it is possible to
discover any injury, and therefore before it is<BR>possible to raise
any action. A strong recommendation was made for the<BR>Legislature
to remedy this injustice and that recommendation was accepted<BR>and
carried into effect by the Limitation Act 1963: but that Act was
confined<BR>to actions for damages for personal injury. I do not
think that if and when<BR>this action comes to be tried, the
defendants should be prevented from<BR>attempting to prove that the
claim by Mrs. O'Shea is statute barred. A<BR>building may be able to
stand undamaged on defective foundations for years<BR>and then
perhaps eight years or so later damage may occur. Whether it
is<BR>possible to prove that damage to the building had occurred four
years before<BR>it manifested itself is another matter, but it can
only be decided by evidence.</FONT></FONT></P>
