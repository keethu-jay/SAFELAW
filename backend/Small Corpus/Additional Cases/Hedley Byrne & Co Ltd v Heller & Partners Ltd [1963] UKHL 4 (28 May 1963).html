This case raised certain interesting questions of law as to the
liability<BR>&quot; of bankers giving references as to the
credit-worthiness of their<BR>&quot; customers. The plaintiffs are a
firm of advertising agents. The<BR>&quot; defendants are merchant
bankers. In outline, the plaintiffs' case<BR>&quot; against the
defendants is that, having placed on behalf of a client,<BR>&quot;
Easipower Limited, on credit terms substantial orders for
advertising<BR>&quot; time on television programmes and for
advertising space in certain<BR>&quot; newspapers on terms under
which they, the plaintiffs, became per-<BR>&quot; sonally liable to
the television and newspaper companies, they<BR>&quot; caused
inquiries to be made through their own bank of the defendants<BR>&quot;
as to the credit-worthiness of Easipower Limited who were customers
of<BR>&quot; the defendants and were given by the defendants
satisfactory<BR>&quot; references. These references turned out not to
be justified, and the<BR>&quot; plaintiffs claim that in reliance on
the references, which they had<BR>&quot; no reason to question, they
refrained from cancelling the orders so<BR>&quot; as to relieve
themselves of their current liabilities.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
National Provincial Bank communicated these replies to
their<BR>customers the Appellants, and it is not suggested that this
was improper<BR>or not warranted by modern custom. The Appellants
relied on these<BR>statements and as a result they lost over &pound;17,000

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
Appellants now seek to recover this loss from the Respondents
as<BR>damages on the ground that these replies were given negligently
and in<BR>breach of the Respondents' duty to exercise care in giving
them. In his<BR>judgment McNair, J. said:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.84cm; margin-right: 0.02cm; text-indent: 0.41cm; margin-top: 0.14cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot; On
the assumption stated above as to the existence of the duty,<BR>&quot;
I have no hesitation in holding (1) that Mr. Heller was guilty of<BR>&quot;
negligence in giving such a reference without making plain&mdash;as
he<BR>&quot; did not&mdash;that it was intended to be a very guarded
reference, and<BR>&quot; (2) that properly understood according to
its ordinary and natural<BR>&quot; meaning the reference was not
justified by facts known to Mr.<BR>&quot;  Heller.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.02cm; text-indent: 0.44cm; margin-top: 0.09cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.45cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Before
your Lordships the Respondents were anxious to contest this<BR>finding,
but your Lordships found it unnecessary to hear argument on
this<BR>matter, being of opinion that the appeal must fail even if
Mr. Heller was<BR>negligent. Accordingly I cannot and do not express
any opinion on the<BR>question whether Mr. Heller was in fact
negligent But I should make it<BR>plain that the Appellants'
complaint is not that Mr. Heller gave his reply<BR>without adequate
knowledge of the position, nor that he intended to create<BR>a false
impression, but that what he said was in fact calculated to create
a<BR>false impression and that he ought to have realised that. And
the same<BR>applies to the Respondents' letter of 11th November.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">McNair, J.
gave judgment for the Respondents on the ground that they<BR>owed no
duty of care to the Appellants. He said:</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">&quot; I
am accordingly driven to the conclusion by authority binding<BR>&quot;
upon me that no such action lies in the absence of contract or<BR>&quot;
fiduciary relationship. On the facts before me there is clearly no<BR>&quot;
contract, nor can I find a fiduciary relationship. It was urged on<BR>&quot;
behalf of the Plaintiff that the fact that Easipower Limited were<BR>&quot;
heavily indebted to the Defendants and that the Defendants might<BR>&quot;
benefit from the advertising campaign financed by the Plaintiffs,<BR>&quot;
were facts from which a special duty to exercise care might be<BR>&quot;
inferred. In my judgment, however, these facts, though clearly<BR>&quot;
relevant on the question of honesty if this had been in issue, are
not<BR>&quot; sufficient to establish any special relationship
involving a duty of<BR>&quot; care even if it was open to me to
extend the sphere of special relation-<BR>&quot; ship beyond that of
contract and fiduciary relationship.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.03cm; margin-right: 0.02cm; text-indent: 0.41cm; margin-top: 0.21cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.45cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">This
judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeal both because they<BR>were
bound by authority and because they were not satisfied that it
would<BR>be reasonable to impose upon a banker the obligation
suggested.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.03cm; text-indent: 0.45cm; margin-top: 0.16cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Before
coming to the main question of law, it may be well to dispose<BR>of
an argument that there was no sufficiently close relationship
between<BR>these parties to give rise to any duty. It is said that
the Respondents did<BR>not know the precise purpose of the enquiries
and did not even know<BR>whether the National Provincial Bank wanted
the information for its own<BR>use or for the use of a customer: they
knew nothing of the Appellants.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-left: 0.15cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">3</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-right: 0.02cm; margin-top: 0.41cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I would
reject that argument. They knew that the enquiry was in
connection<BR>with an advertising contract, and it was at least
probable that the infor-<BR>mation was wanted by the advertising
contractors. It seems to me quite<BR>immaterial that they did not
know who these contractors were: there is no<BR>suggestion of any
speciality which could have influenced them in deciding<BR>whether to
give information or in what form to give it. I shall therefore<BR>treat
this as if it were a case where a negligent misrepresentation is
made<BR>directly to the person seeking information, opinion or
advice, and I shall<BR>not attempt to decide what kind or degree of
proximity is necessary before<BR>there can be a duty owed by the
defendant to the plaintiff.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.01cm; text-indent: 0.47cm; margin-top: 0.1cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The
Appellants' first argument was based on <I>Donoghue </I>v. <I>Stevenson
</I>[1932]<BR>A.C. 562. That is a very important decision, but I do
not think that it has<BR>any direct bearing on this case. That
decision may encourage us to develop<BR>existing lines of authority
but it cannot entitle us to disregard them. Apart<BR>altogether from
authority, I would think that the law must treat negligent<BR>words
differently from negligent acts. The law ought so far as possible<BR>to
reflect the standards of the reasonable man, and that is what
<I>Donoghue<BR></I>v. <I>Stevenson </I>sets out to do. The most
obvious difference between negligent<BR>words and negligent acts is
this. Quite careful people often express definite<BR>opinions on
social or informal occasions even when they see that others<BR>are
likely to be influenced by them ; and they often do that without
taking<BR>that care which they would take if asked for their opinion
professionally<BR>or in a business connection. The Appellant agrees
that there can be no<BR>duty of care on such occasions, and we were
referred to American and South<BR>African authorities where that is
recognised although their law appears to<BR>have gone much further
than ours has yet done. But it is at least unusual<BR>casually to put
into circulation negligently-made articles which are dan-<BR>gerous.
A man might give a friend a negligently-prepared bottle of home-<BR>made
wine and his friend's guests might drink it with dire results. But<BR>it
is by no means clear that those guests would have no action against
the<BR>negligent manufacturer.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.01cm; margin-right: 0.02cm; text-indent: 0.44cm; margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Another
obvious difference is that a negligently-made article will only<BR>cause
one accident and so it is not very difficult to find the necessary
degree<BR>of proximity or neighbourhood between the negligent
manufacturer and<BR>the person injured. But words can be broadcast
with or without the consent<BR>or the foresight of the speaker or
writer. It would be one thing to say that<BR>the speaker owes a duty
to a limited class, but it would be going very<BR>far to say that he
owes a duty to every ultimate &quot; consumer &quot; who acts
on<BR>those words to his detriment. It would be no use to say that a
speaker<BR>or writer owes a duty but can disclaim responsibility if
he wants to. He,<BR>like the manufacturer, could make it part of a
contract that he is not to be<BR>liable for his negligence: but that
contract would not protect him in a<BR>question with a third party,
at least if the third party was unaware of it.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 0.02cm; text-indent: 0.44cm; margin-top: 0.11cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">So it
seems to me that there is good sense behind our present law that<BR>in
general an innocent but negligent misrepresentation gives no cause
of<BR>action. There must be something more than the mere
misstatement. I<BR>therefore turn to the authorities to see what more
is required. The most<BR>natural requirement would be that expressly
or by implication from the<BR>circumstances the speaker or writer has
undertaken some responsibility,<BR>and that appears to me not to
conflict with any authority which is binding<BR>on this House. Where
there is a contract there is no difficulty as regards<BR>the
contracting parties: the question is whether there is a warranty.
The<BR>refusal of English law to recognise any <I>jus quaesitum
tertio </I>causes some<BR>difficulties, but they are not relevant
here. Then there are cases where a<BR>person does not merely make a
statement but performs a gratuitous service.<BR>I do not intend to
examine the cases about that, but at least they show that<BR>in some
cases that person owes a duty of care apart from any contract,<BR>and
to that extent they pave the way to holding that there can be a
duty<BR>of care in making a statement of fact or opinion which is
independent of<BR>contract.</FONT></FONT></P>

Haldane, L.C.<BR>dealt with <I>Derry </I>v. <I>Peek </I>and pointed
out (at p. 947) that while the relation-<BR>ship of the parties in
that case was not enough, the case did not decide<BR>&quot; that,
where a different sort of relationship ought to be inferred from
the<BR>&quot; circumstances, the case is to be concluded by asking
whether an action<BR>&quot; for deceit will lie ... There are other
obligations besides that of honesty<BR>&quot; the breach of which may
give a right to damages. These obligations<BR>&quot; depend on
principles which the judges have worked out in the fashion<BR>&quot;
that is characteristic of a system where much of the law has always
been<BR>&quot; judge-made and unwritten.&quot; It hardly needed
<I>Donoghue v. Stevenson<BR></I>to show that that process can still
operate. Then (at p. 950) Lord Haldane<BR>quoted a passage from the
speech of Lord Herschell in <I>Derry v. Peek<BR></I>where he excluded
from the principle of that case &quot; those cases where a<BR>&quot;
person within whose special province it lay to know a particular
fact<BR>&quot; has given an erroneous answer to an inquiry made with
regard to it by<BR>&quot; a person desirous of ascertaining the fact
for the purpose of determining<BR>&quot; his course &quot;. Then (at
p. 954) he explained the expression &quot; constructive<BR>&quot;
fraud &quot; and said: &quot; What it really means in this connection
is, not moral<BR>&quot; fraud in the ordinary sense, but breach of
the sort of obligation which is<BR>&quot; enforced by a court which
from the beginning regarded itself as a court<BR>&quot; of conscience

and<BR>said (at p. 955): &quot;If such a duty can be inferred in a
particular case of a<BR>&quot; person issuing a prospectus, as, for
instance, in the case of directors<BR>&quot; issuing to the
shareholders of the company which they direct a prospectus<BR>&quot;
inviting the subscription by them of further capital, I do not find

maintained when there is no fraud &quot; (p. 498). Bowen, L.J.<BR>gave
a similar reason: he said: &quot; Then <I>Derry </I>v. <I>Peek
</I>decided this further<BR>&quot; point&mdash;viz. that in cases
like the present (of which <I>Derry </I>v. <I>Peek </I>was<BR>&quot;
itself an instance) there is no duty enforceable in law to be careful
&quot;<BR>(p. 501); and he added that the law of England &quot; does
not consider that<BR>&quot; what a man writes on paper is like a gun
or other dangerous instrument;<BR>&quot; and, unless he intended to
deceive, the law does not, in the absence of<BR>&quot; contract, hold
him responsible for drawing his certificate carelessly&quot;<BR>(p.

of the Inglis<BR>brothers Harley got his London bank to write to
M'Arthur, a branch agent<BR>of the National Bank of Scotland, and
M'Arthur on 28th July, 1910, sent a<BR>reply which was ultimately

After Counsel<BR>&quot; for the respondents had been heard for a
short time. Earl Loreburn informed<BR>&quot; him that their
Lordships, as at present advised, thought that there was no<BR>&quot;
special duty on M'Arthur toward the pursuer; that the respondents
were<BR>&quot; not liable unless M'Arthur's representations were
dishonest; and that their<BR>&quot; Lordships had not been satisfied
as yet that the representations were dis-<BR>&quot; honest . . . that
under the circumstances the House was prepared to<BR>&quot; dismiss
the appeal, but that they considered the pursuer had been badly<BR>&quot;
treated though he had not any cause of action at law, and that,
therefore,<BR>&quot; their Lordships were disposed to direct that
there should be no costs of the<BR>&quot; action on either side. Earl
Loreburn said that Mr. Blackburn might prefer<BR>&quot; to argue the
case further and endeavour to alter these views, but of course<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

is very nearly indistinguishable from the present case. Lord<BR>Loreburn
regarded the fact that M'Arthur knew that his letter might be<BR>used
to influence others besides the immediate enquirer as entitling
Robinson<BR>to found on it if fraud had been proved. But it is not
clear to me that he<BR>intended to decide that there would have been
sufficient proximity between<BR>Robinson and M'Arthur to enable him
to maintain that there was a special<BR>relationship involving a duty
of care if the other facts had been sufficient to<BR>create such a
relationship. I would not regard this as a binding decision on<BR>that

regard to the bank's duty Lord Haldane said: &quot; There is only
one<BR>'' other point about which I wish to say anything, and that is
the question<BR>&quot; which was argued by the appellant, as to there
being a special duty of<BR>&quot; care under the circumstances here.
I think the case of <I>Deny </I>v. <I>Peek </I>in<BR>&quot; this
House has finally settled in Scotland, as well as in England and
Ireland,<BR>&quot; the conclusion that in a case like this no duty to
be careful is established.<BR>&quot; There is the general duty of
common honesty, and that duty, of course<BR>&quot; applies to the
circumstances of this case as it applies to all other circum-<BR>&quot;
stances. But when a mere inquiry is made by one banker of another,
who<BR>&quot; stands in no special relation to him, then, in the
absence of special circum-<BR>&quot; stances from which a contract to

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">I think
that by &quot; a contract to be careful &quot; Lord Haldane must have
meant<BR>an agreement or undertaking to be careful. This was a Scots
case and by<BR>Scots law there can be a contract without
consideration: Lord Haldane<BR>cannot have meant that similar cases
in Scotland and England would be<BR>decided differently on the matter
of special relationship for that reason. I<BR>am, I think, entitled
to note that this was an extempore judgment. So<BR>Lord Haldane was
contrasting a &quot; mere inquiry &quot; with a case where there<BR>are
special circumstances from which an undertaking to be careful can
be<BR>inferred. In <I>Robinson's </I>case any such undertaking was
excluded by the<BR>sentence in M'Arthur's letter which I have quoted
and in which he said<BR>that the information was given &quot; on the
express understanding that we incur<BR>&quot; no responsibility
whatever in furnishing it.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

to me that the only possible distinction in the present case is<BR>that
here there was no adequate disclaimer of responsibility. But here
the<BR>Appellants' bank, who were their agents in making the enquiry,
began by<BR>saying that &quot; they wanted to know in confidence and
without responsibility<BR>&quot; on our part &quot;, that is, on the
part of the Respondents. So I cannot see how<BR>the Appellants can

Appellants founded on a number of cases in contract where very<BR>clear
words were required to exclude the duty of care which would
otherwise<BR>have flowed from the contract. To that argument there
are, I think, two<BR>answers. In the case of a contract it is
necessary to exclude liability for<BR>negligence, but in this case
the question is whether an undertaking to assume<BR>a duty to take
care can be inferred: and that is a very different matter.
And,<BR>secondly, even in cases of contract general words may be
sufficient if there<BR>was no other kind of liability to be excluded
except liability for negligence:<BR>the general rule is that a party
is not exempted from liability for negligence<BR>&quot; unless
adequate words are used &quot;&mdash;per Scrutton, L.J., in <I>Rutter
v. Palmer<BR></I>[1922] 2 K.B. 87. It being admitted that there was
here a duty to give an<BR>honest reply, I do not see what further
liability there could be to exclude<BR>except liability for

agreed with the<BR>learned Judge that no such duty was owed and it
was therefore not necessary<BR>for them to consider whether the
finding of negligence ought or ought not<BR>be upheld. In your

not become necessary to consider whether the finding of negli-<BR>gence

were doing business with a company called Easipower Ltd. In<BR>August,
1958, Hedleys wanted a banker's report concerning that company<BR>who
then had an account with the bank. [In November, 1957, Hedleys
had<BR>received a report about the company which had been given by
another bank<BR>though not by direct communication.] Hedleys banked
at a Piccadilly<BR>branch of the National Provincial Bank Limited.
Hedleys asked that a<BR>report concerning Easipower Ltd. should be
obtained. The Piccadilly<BR>branch communicated with the City office
of their bank, the National<BR>Provincial. The National Provincial
City office telephoned the bank on the<BR>18th August, 1958, and it
is common ground that the representative of the<BR>National
Provincial said that &quot; they wanted to know in confidence &quot;
and<BR>&quot; without responsibility &quot; on the part of the bank
as to the respectability<BR>and standing of Easipower Ltd. and
whether Easipower Ltd. &quot; would be<BR>&quot; good for an
advertising contract for &pound;8/9,000.&quot; To that oral inquiry
the<BR>bank then gave an oral answer. In due course the answer then
given was<BR>communicated by the Piccadilly branch of the National
Provincial to Hedleys.<BR>It was communicated orally and a letter of
confirmation from that branch<BR>(dated the 21st August, 1958) was

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">It is, I
think, a reasonable and proper inference that the bank must
have<BR>known that the National Provincial were making their enquiry
because some<BR>customer of theirs was or might be entering into some
advertising contract<BR>in respect of which Easipower Ltd. might
become under a liability to such<BR>customer to the extent of the
figures mentioned. The enquiries were from<BR>one bank to another.
The name of the customer (Hedleys) was not men-<BR>tioned by the
enquiring bank (National Provincial) to the answering bank<BR>(the
bank): nor did the enquiring bank (National Provincial) give to
the<BR>customer (Hedleys) the name of the answering bank (the bank).
These<BR>circumstances do not seem to me to be material. The bank
must have<BR>known that the enquiry was being made by someone who was
contemplating<BR>doing business with Easipower Ltd. and that their
answer or the substance<BR>of it would in fact be passed on to such
person. The conditions subject<BR>to which the bank gave their
answers are important but the fact that the<BR>person to whom the
answers would in all probability be passed on was<BR>unnamed and
unknown to the bank is not important for the purposes of
a<BR>consideration of the legal issue which now arises. It is
inherently unlikely<BR>that the bank would have entertained a direct
application from Hedleys<BR>asking for a report or would have
answered an enquiry made by Hedleys<BR>themselves: even if they had
they would certainly have stipulated that their<BR>answer was without
responsibility. The present appeal does not raise any<BR>question as
to the circumstances under which a banker is entitled (apart<BR>from
direct authorisation) to answer an enquiry. I leave that question
as<BR>it was left by Atkin, L.J. in <I>Tournier </I>v. <I>National
Provincial &amp; Union Bank<BR>of England </I>[1924] 1 K.B. 461, when
(at p. 486) he said: &quot; I do not desire to<BR>&quot; express any
final opinion on the practice of bankers to give one another<BR>&quot;
information as to the affairs of their respective customers, except
to say<BR>&quot; it appears to me that if it is justified it must be
upon the basis of an<BR>&quot; implied consent of the customer.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

issue which arises is, therefore, whether the bank would have<BR>been
under a liability to Hedleys if they had failed to exercise care.
This<BR>involves the questions whether the circumstances were such
that the bank<BR>owed a duty of care to Hedleys, or would have owed
such a duty but for<BR>the words &quot; Without Responsibility &quot;,
or whether they owed such a duty<BR>but were given a defence by the

it seems to me that if A assumes a responsibility to B to<BR>tender
him deliberate advice there could be a liability if the advice
is<BR>negligently given. I say &quot; could be &quot; because the
ordinary courtesies and<BR>exchanges of life would become impossible
if it were sought to attach<BR>legal obligation to every kindly and
friendly act. But the principle of the<BR>matter would not appear to
be in doubt. If A employs B (who might<BR>for example be a
professional man such as an accountant or a solicitor<BR>or a doctor)
for reward to give advice and if the advice is negligently
given<BR>there could be a liability in B to pay damages. The fact
that the advice<BR>is given in words would not, in my view, prevent
liability from arising.<BR>Quite apart, however, from employment or
contract there may be circum-<BR>stances in which a duty to exercise
care will arise if a service is voluntarily<BR>undertaken. A medical
man may unexpectedly come across an unconscious<BR>man, who is a
complete stranger to him, and who is in urgent need of<BR>skilled
attention: if the medical man, following the fine traditions of
his<BR>profession, proceeds to treat the unconscious man he must
exercise reason-<BR>able skill and care in doing so. In his speech in
<I>Banbury v. Bank of<BR>Montreal </I>[1918] A.C. 626 Lord Atkinson
(at p. 689) said: &quot;It is well<BR>&quot; established that if a
doctor proceeded to treat a patient gratuitously, even<BR>&quot; in a
case where the patient was insensible at the time and incapable of<BR>&quot;
employing him, the doctor would be bound to exercise all the

bank with a definite request that the<BR>bank would give him
deliberate advice as to certain financial matters of<BR>a nature with
which the bank ordinarily dealt the bank would be under<BR>no
obligation to accede to the request: if however they undertook,
though<BR>gratuitously, to give deliberate advice (I exclude what I

contractual or<BR>fiduciary relationship and irrespective of any
direct dealing, a duty may be<BR>owed by one person to another. It is

maker of them unless there is either some contractual or
fiduciary<BR>relationship with a person adversely affected by the
making of them or<BR>unless through the making of them something is
created or circulated or some<BR>situation is created which is

a<BR>reliance upon words from injury which is caused by a reliance

safety for use of<BR>the contents of a bottle of hair wash or a

if A claims that he has suffered injury or<BR>loss as a result of

further enquiry<BR>is raised as to the nature of the duty. There may
be circumstances under<BR>which the only duty owed by B to A is the
duty of being honest: there<BR>may be circumstances under which B

aside cases where there is some contractual or fiduciary
relation-<BR>ship, there may be many situations in which one person
voluntarily or<BR>gratuitously undertakes to do something for another
person and becomes<BR>under a duty to exercise reasonable care. I
have given illustrations. But<BR>apart from cases where there is some
direct dealing there may be cases<BR>where one person issues a
document which should be the result of an<BR>exercise of the skill
and judgment required by him in his calling and where<BR>he knows and
intends that its accuracy will be relied upon by another. In<BR>this

Willson<BR></I>L.R. <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpCh/1888/108.html">39 ChD 39</a>. The owner of some property wished to
obtain an<BR>advance of money on mortgage of the property and applied
to a firm of<BR>solicitors for the purpose of their finding a
mortgagee. Being informed<BR>by the solicitors that for the purpose
of finding a mortgagee he should<BR>have a valuation made of the
property he consulted the defendants and<BR>asked them to make a
valuation. They surveyed and inspected the property<BR>and then made
a valuation which they sent to the solicitors. The solicitors<BR>then
particularly called the defendants' attention to the purpose for
which<BR>the valuation was wanted and to the responsibility they were
undertaking.<BR>The defendants staled that their valuation was a
moderate one and certainly<BR>was not made in favour of the borrower.
The valuation and representations<BR>so made by the defendants to the
solicitors were communicated to the<BR>plaintiff (and a co-trustee of
his) by the solicitors. The plaintiff (and his<BR>co-trustee, who
died before the commencement of the action) then advanced<BR>money to
the owner upon the security of a mortgage of his property.<BR>Chitty,
J., held on the evidence (1) that the defendants were aware of<BR>the
purpose for which the valuation was made, and (2) that the &quot;
valuation<BR>&quot; was sent by the Defendants direct to the agents
of the Plaintiff for the<BR>&quot; purpose of inducing the Plaintiff
and his co-trustee to lay out the trust<BR>&quot; money on mortgage&quot;.
The owner made default in payment and the<BR>property proved
insufficient to answer the mortgage. The plaintiff alleged<BR>that
the value of the property was not anything like the value given
by<BR>the defendants in their valuation. Chitty, J., held that &quot;
the valuation as<BR>&quot; made was, in fact, no valuation at all.&quot;
In those circumstances the claim<BR>made was on the basis that the
plaintiff has sustained loss through the<BR>negligence, want of
skill, breach of duty and misrepresentation of the<BR>defendants.
Chilly, J., held the defendants liable. His decision was<BR>principally
based upon his finding that the defendants owed a duty of<BR>care to
the plaintiff. It had been argued that there was also liability
in<BR>the defendants in contract (referred to in the judgment as the
first ground)<BR>and on the ground of fraud (referred to as the third
ground). At the end<BR>of his judgment Chitty, J., said: &quot;I have
entirely passed by the question<BR>&quot; of contract. It is
unnecessary to decide that point. I consider on these<BR>&quot; two
last grounds&mdash;and if I were to prefer one to the other it would
be<BR>&quot; the second ground&mdash;that the Defendant is liable for
the negligence.&quot; In<BR>the course of his judgment he said: &quot;
It is not necessary, in my opinion,<BR>&quot; to decide the case with
reference to the third point, but even on the third<BR>&quot; point I
think the Defendants are liable&mdash;and that is what may be
termed<BR>&quot; fraudulent misrepresentation.&quot; He then (that
is, on the 7th June, 1888) re-<BR>ferred to the judgment in the Court
of Appeal in <I>Peek </I>v. <I>Derry </I>(37 Ch. D.<BR>541). That
judgment was reversed in the House of Lords on the 1st July,<BR>1889.
Chitty, J., compared the situation with that which arose in <I>Heaven
</I>v.<BR><I>Pender (supra). </I>He pointed out that in that case
there was &quot; no contractual<BR>&quot; relation between the
Plaintiff and the dock owner, and there was no<BR>&quot; personal
direct invitation to the Plaintiff to come and do the work on<BR>&quot;
that ship, yet it was held that the dock owner had undertaken an
obliga-<BR>&quot; tion towards the Plaintiff, who was one of the
persons likely to come<BR>&quot; and do the work to the vessel, and
that he was liable to him and was<BR>&quot; under an obligation to
him to use due diligence in the construction of<BR>&quot; the
staging.&quot; Chitty, J., went on, therefore, to hold that as the
defendants<BR>had &quot;knowingly placed themselves&quot; in the
position of sending their<BR>valuation &quot; direct to the agents of
the Plaintiff for the purpose of inducing<BR>&quot; the Plaintiff &quot;
then they &quot; in point of law incurred a duty towards him<BR>&quot;
to use reasonable care in the preparation of the document.&quot; He

<I>Cann </I>v <I>Willson </I>is not now law. Chitty, J., in deciding
that<BR>&quot; case, acted upon an erroneous proposition of law,
which has been since<BR>&quot; overruled by the House of Lords in
<I>Deny </I>v. <I>Peek </I>when they restated<BR>&quot; the old law
that, in the absence of contract, an action for negligence cannot<BR>&quot;
be maintained when there is no fraud.&quot; Bowen, L.J., said (at p.

overruled <I>Cann </I>v. <I>Willson. </I>He<BR>considered that <I>Heaven
</I>v. <I>Pender </I>gave no support for that decision because<BR>it
was no more than an instance of the class of cases where one
who,<BR>having the conduct and control of premises which may injure
those whom<BR>he knows will have a right to and will use them, owes a
duty to protect<BR>them. He said (at p. 501): &quot; Then <I>Derry </I>v.
<I>Peek </I>decided this further point&mdash;<BR>&quot; viz., that in
cases like the present (of which <I>Derry </I>v. <I>Peek </I>was
itself<BR>&quot; an instance) there is no duty enforceable in law to
be careful.&quot; He<BR>followed the view expressed by Romer, J., in
<I>Scholes </I>v. <I>Brook, </I>63 L.T.<BR>(N.S.) 837, that the
decision of the House of Lords in <I>Derry </I>v. <I>Peek
</I>by<BR>implication negatived the existence of any such general
rule as laid down<BR>in <I>Cann </I>v. <I>Willson. </I>The reasoning

the case is to be concluded by asking whether an action for deceit
will<BR>&quot; lie. I think that the authorities subsequent to the
decision of the House<BR>&quot; of Lords shew a tendency to assume

system where much of the law has always<BR>&quot; been judge-made and

of the duty of universal obligation to be honest and the principle
which<BR>&quot; gave the right to rescission, the Courts, and
especially the Court of Chan-<BR>&quot; cery, had to deal with the
other cases to which I have referred, cases<BR>&quot; raising claims
of an essentially different character, which have often been<BR>&quot;
mistaken for actions of deceit. Such claims raise the question
whether<BR>&quot; the circumstances and relations of the parties are
such as to give rise to<BR>&quot; duties of particular obligation
which have not been fulfilled.&quot; Lord<BR>Haldane pointed out that
from the circumstances and relations of the parties<BR>a special duty
may arise: there may be an implied contract at law or a<BR>fiduciary
obligation in equity. What <I>Deny </I>v. <I>Peek </I>decided was

propose to examine the facts of particular situations or the facts<BR>of
recently decided cases in the light of this analysis, but I proceed
to apply<BR>it to the facts of the case now under review. As I have
stated, I approach<BR>the case on the footing that the bank knew that
what they said would in<BR>fact be passed on to some unnamed person
who was a customer of the<BR>National Provincial Bank. The fact that
it was said that &quot; they &quot;, that is,<BR>the National
Provincial Bank, &quot; wanted to know &quot; does not prevent
this<BR>conclusion. In these circumstances I think some duty towards
the unnamed<BR>person, whoever it was, was owed by the bank. There
was a duty of honesty.<BR>The great question, however, is whether
there was a duty of care. The<BR>bank need not have answered the
enquiry from the National Provincial<BR>Bank. It appears, however,
that it is a matter of banking convenience<BR>or courtesy and
presumably of mutual business advantage that enquiries<BR>as between
banks will be answered. The fact that it is most unlikely that<BR>the
bank would have answered a direct enquiry from Hedleys does
not<BR>affect the question as to what the bank must have known as to
the use that<BR>would be made of any answer that they gave but it
cannot be left out<BR>of account in considering what it was that the
bank undertook to do. It<BR>does not seem to me that they undertook
before answering an enquiry to<BR>expend time or trouble &quot; in
searching records, studying documents, weighing<BR>&quot; and
comparing the favourable and unfavourable features and producing<BR>&quot;
a well-balanced and well-worded report.&quot; (I quote the words of
Pearson,<BR>L.J.). Nor does it seem to me that the enquiring bank
(nor therefore<BR>their customer) would expect such a process. This
was, I think, what was<BR>denoted by Lord Haldane in his speech in
<I>Robinson </I>v. <I>National Bank of<BR>Scotland </I>when he spoke
of a &quot; mere inquiry &quot; being made by one banker<BR>of
another. In <I>Parsons v. Barclay &amp; Co. Ltd. </I>[1910] 26 T.L.R.
628, 103 L.T.<BR>196 C.A., Cozens-Hardy, M.R. expressed the view that
it was no part of a<BR>banker's duty, when asked for a reference, to
make inquiries outside as to<BR>the solvency or otherwise of the
person asked about or to do more than<BR>answer the question put to
him honestly from what he knew from the books<BR>and accounts before

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Mr. Foster
for the Respondents has given your Lordships three reasons<BR>why the
Appellants should not recover. The first is founded upon a
general<BR>statement of the law which, if true, is of immense effect.
Its hypothesis is<BR>that there is no general duty not to make
careless statements. No one<BR>challenges that hypothesis. There is
no duty to be careful in speech as there<BR>is a duty to be honest in
speech. Nor indeed is there any general duty<BR>to be careful in
action. The duty is limited to those who can establish<BR>some
relationship of proximity such as was found to exist in <I>Donoghue
</I>v.<BR><I>Stevenson </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/1931/3.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/100.html">[1932] AC 562</a></a>. A plaintiff cannot,
therefore, recover for financial<BR>loss caused by a careless
statement unless he can show that the maker of<BR>the statement was
under a special duty to him to be careful. Mr. Foster<BR>submits that
this special duty must be brought under one of three categories.<BR>It
must be contractual; or it must be fiduciary; or it must arise from
the<BR>relationship of proximity and the financial loss must flow
from physical<BR>damage done to the person or the property of the
plaintiff. The law is now<BR>settled, Mr. Foster submits, and these
three categories are exhaustive. It<BR>was so decided in <I>Candler
</I>v. <I>Crane, Christmas &amp; Co. </I>[1951] 2 K.B. 164, and<BR>that
decision, Mr. Foster submits, is right in principle and in accordance
with<BR>earlier authorities.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Mr.
Gardiner for the Appellants agrees that outside contractual
and<BR>fiduciary duty there must be a relationship of proximity&mdash;that
is <I>Donoghue<BR>v. Stevenson</I>&mdash;but he disputes that
recovery is then limited to loss flowing<BR>from physical damage. He
has not been able to cite a single case in which<BR>a defendant has
been held liable for a careless statement leading, otherwise<BR>than
through the channel of physical damage, to financial loss. But
he<BR>submits that in principle such loss ought to be recoverable and
that there is<BR>no authority which prevents your Lordships from
acting upon that principle.<BR>Unless Mr. Gardiner can persuade your
Lordships of this, his case fails<BR>at the outset. This, therefore,
is the first and the most fundamental of the<BR>issues which the

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Mr.
Foster's second reason is that, if it is open to your Lordships
to<BR>declare that there are or can be special or proximate
relationships outside<BR>the categories he has named, your Lordships
cannot formulate one to fit<BR>the case of a banker who gives a
reference to a third party who is not his<BR>customer; and he
contends that your Lordships have already decided that<BR>point in
<I>Robinson </I>v. <I>The National Bank of Scotland </I>(1916)<I>
</I>S.C. (H.L.) 154.<BR>His third reason is that if there can be
found in cases such as this a special<BR>relationship between bankers
and third parties, on the facts of the present<BR>case the Appellants
fall outside it; and here he relies particularly on the<BR>fact that
the reference was marked &quot; Strictly confidential and given on
the<BR>&quot; express understanding that we incur no responsibility
whatever in<BR>furnishing it.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

I approach the consideration of the first and fundamental<BR>question

of<BR>question&mdash;that is, in essence the same sort, though in
particulars very<BR>different&mdash;in <I>Donoghue </I>v. <I>Stevenson.
</I>If Mr. Foster's proposition is the<BR>result of the authorities,
then, as Lord Atkin said at page 582, &quot; I should<BR>&quot;
consider the result a grave defect in the law, and so contrary to
principle<BR>&quot; that I should hesitate long before following any
decision to that effect which<BR>&quot; had not the authority of this
House.&quot; So before I examine the authorities,<BR>I shall explain
why I think that the law, if settled as Mr. Foster says it is,<BR>would
be defective. As well as being defective in the sense that it
would<BR>leave a man without a remedy where he ought to have one and
where it is<BR>well within the scope of the law to give him one, it
would also be profoundly<BR>illogical. The common law is tolerant of

The<BR>interposition of the physical injury is said to make a

The main difficulty, I think, lies in discovering from the
state-<BR>ment of claim what the cause of action was. Lord Ashburton
sought<BR>relief from the consequences of having advanced money on
mortgage to<BR>several persons of whom the defendant Nocton was one.
The statement<BR>of claim consists of a long narrative of events
interspersed with complaints.<BR>Although in the end the vital fact
was that Nocton was Ashburton's solicitor,<BR>there is no allegation
of any retainer and nothing is pleaded in contract.<BR>The fact that
Nocton was a solicitor emerges only in the framing of the<BR>complaint
in paragraph 13 where it was said that Nocton's advice to make<BR>the
advance of &pound;65,000 &quot; was not that of a solicitor advising
his client in<BR>&quot; good faith but was given for his own private
ends &quot;. The relief asked for<BR>in respect of this transaction
is a declaration that the plaintiff &quot; was im-<BR>&quot; properly
advised and induced by the defendant Nocton whilst acting as<BR>&quot;
the plaintiff's confidential solicitor &quot; to advance &pound;65,000.
In paragraphs<BR>31 to 33 of the statement of claim it is related
that the plaintiff was asked<BR>to release part of his security for
the loan ; and it is said that &quot; The defendant<BR>&quot; Nocton
in advising the plaintiff to execute the said release allowed the<BR>&quot;'
plaintiff to believe that he was advising the plaintiff independently
and in<BR>&quot; good faith and in the plaintiff's interest&quot;. No
separate relief was sought<BR>in respect of this transaction.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">It can now
be understood why Lord Haldane regarded the question as<BR>one of
form rather than of substance. The first question which the House<BR>had
to consider was whether the statement of claim was wide enough
to<BR>cover negligence. Lord Parmoor thought that it was and at page
965 decided<BR>the appeal on that ground. So I think in the end did
Lord Dunedin at<BR>page 965, but he also expressed his agreement with
the opinion of Haldane,<BR>L.C. Lord Haldane, with whom Lord Atkinson
concurred, thought that<BR>possibly negligence was covered, but he
did not take the view that the<BR>statement of claim must be
interpreted either as an allegation of deceit or as<BR>an allegation
of negligence. He said at page 946: &quot; There is a third form of<BR>&quot;
procedure to which the statement of claim approximated very closely,
and<BR>&quot; that is the old bill in Chancery to enforce
compensation for breach of a<BR>&quot; fiduciary obligation. There
appears to have been an impression that the<BR>&quot; necessity which
recent authorities have established of proving moral fraud<BR>&quot;
in order to succeed in an action of deceit has narrowed the scope of
this<BR>&quot; remedy. For the reasons which I am about to offer to
your Lordships, I do<BR>&quot; not think that this is so.&quot; The

each other at the time of the transaction.&quot; He stated at page
969 that the<BR>defendant was Lord Ashburton's solicitor and so under
a duty to advise.<BR>He concluded at page 972 in the following terms:
&quot;Once the relations of<BR>&quot; parties have been ascertained
to be those in which a duty is laid upon one<BR>&quot; person of
giving information or advice to another upon which that other is<BR>&quot;
entitled to rely as the basis of a transaction, responsibility for
error<BR>&quot; amounting to misrepresentation in any statement made
will attach to the<BR>&quot; adviser or informer, although the
information and advice have been given<BR>&quot; not fraudulently but
in good faith. It is admitted in the present case<BR>&quot; that
misrepresentations were made; that they were material; that they<BR>&quot;
were the cause of the loss; that they were made by a solicitor to
his<BR>&quot; client in a situation in which the client was entitled
to rely, and did rely,<BR>&quot; upon the information received. I
accordingly think that that situation<BR>&quot; is plainly open for
the application of the principle of liability to which I<BR>&quot;
have referred, namely, liability for the consequences of a failure of
duty<BR>&quot; in circumstances in which it was a matter equivalent
to contract between<BR>&quot; the parties that that duty should be
fulfilled.&quot; Lord Shaw does not<BR>anywhere in his speech refer
to the relationship as being of a fiduciary<BR>character.</FONT></FONT></P>

from liability for<BR>&quot; negligence in act, it is none the less
true that a man may come under a<BR>&quot; special duty to exercise
care in giving information or advice. I should<BR>&quot; accordingly
be sorry to be thought to lend countenance to the idea that<BR>&quot;
recent decisions have been intended to stereotype the cases in which
people<BR>&quot; can be held to have assumed such a special duty.
Whether such a duty has<BR>&quot; been assumed must depend on the
relationship of the parties, and it is at<BR>&quot; least certain
that there are a good many cases in which that relationship may<BR>&quot;
be properly treated as giving rise to a special duty of care in
statement.&quot;<BR>It is quite true that Haldane, L.C. applied this

it should, but as it<BR>is only a general conception it does not get
them very far. Then they<BR>take the specific proposition laid down

Respondents in this case cannot deny that they were performing
a<BR>service. Their sheet anchor is that they were performing it
gratuitously<BR>and therefore no liability for its performance can
arise. My Lords, in<BR>my opinion this is not the law. A promise
given without consideration to<BR>perform a service cannot be
enforced as a contract by the promisee; but if<BR>the service is in
fact performed and done negligently, the promisee can<BR>recover in
an action in tort. This is the foundation of the liability of
a<BR>gratuitous bailee. In the famous case of <I>Coggs v. Bernard
</I>(1703) Smith's<BR>Leading Cases 13th Ed. Vol. 1 p. 175, where the
defendant had charge of<BR>brandy belonging to the plaintiff and had
spilt a quantity of it, there was<BR>a motion in arrest of judgment &quot;
for that it was not alleged in the declara-<BR>&quot; tion that the
defendant was a common porter, nor averred that he had<BR>&quot;
anything for his pains &quot;. The declaration was held to be good
notwith-<BR>standing that there was not any consideration laid.
Gould, J. said: &quot; The<BR>&quot; reason of the action is, the
particular trust reposed in the defendant,<BR>&quot; to which he has
concurred by his assumption, and in the executing which<BR>&quot; he
has miscarried by his neglect.&quot; This proposition is not limited
to the<BR>law of bailment. In <I>Skelton </I>v. <I>London &amp; North
Western Railway Co. </I>[1867]<BR>L.R. 2 C.P. 631, Willes, J. at 636
applied it generally to the law of negli-<BR>gence. He said: &quot;
Actionable negligence must consist in the breach of<BR>'' some duty
... If a person undertakes to perform a voluntary act, he is<BR>&quot;
liable if he performs it improperly, but not if he neglects to
perform it.<BR>&quot; Such is the result of the decision in the case
of <I>Coggs </I>v. <I>Bernard.&quot; </I>Like-<BR>wise in <I>Banbury
</I>v. <I>Bank of Montreal </I>[1918] A.C. 626, where the bank
had<BR>advised a customer on his investments, Finlay, L.C. at 654

principle has been applied to cases where as a result of the

gratuitously to get a fire policy renewed for the<BR>plaintiff, but,
in doing so, neglected formalities, the omission of which<BR>rendered
the policy inoperative. It was held that an action would lie. In<BR>two
similar cases the defendants succeeded on the ground that
negligence<BR>was not proved in fact. Both cases were thus decided on
the basis that<BR>in law an action would He. In the first of them,
<I>Shiells </I>v. <I>Blackburne </I>[1789]<BR>1 H. Bl. 158, the

In <I>Dartnall<BR>v. Howard </I>(1825) B. &amp; C. 345 the defendants

both, nor whether it<BR>was obtained as a result of special inquiries

therefore, that there is ample authority to justify your Lordships<BR>in
saying now that the categories of special relationships which may
give<BR>rise to a duty to take care in word as well as in deed are
not limited to<BR>contractual relationships or to relationships of
fiduciary duty, but include<BR>also relationships which in the words
of Lord Shaw in <I>Nocton v. Ashburton<BR></I>at page 972 are &quot;
equivalent to contract&quot; that is, where there is an assump-<BR>tion
of responsibility in circumstances in which, but for the absence of
con-<BR>sideration, there would be a contract. Where there is an
express undertaking,<BR>an express warranty as distinct from mere
representation, there can be<BR>little difficulty. The difficulty
arises in discerning those cases in which the<BR>undertaking is to be
implied. In this respect the absence of consideration<BR>is not
irrelevant. Payment for information or advice is very good
evidence<BR>that it is being relied upon and that the informer or
adviser knows that it is.<BR>Where there is no consideration, it will
be necessary to exercise greater<BR>care in distinguishing between
social and professional relationships and<BR>between those which are
of a contractual character and those which are not.<BR>It may often
be material to consider whether the adviser is acting purely<BR>out
of good nature or whether he is getting his reward in some indirect
form.<BR>The service that a bank performs in giving a reference is
not done simply<BR>out of a desire to assist commerce. It would
discourage the customers of<BR>the bank if their deals fell through

of definition of the sort of relationship which gives rise to a

and so creates a<BR>duty of care towards them. I do not understand
any of your Lordships to<BR>hold that it is a responsibility imposed
by law upon certain types of persons<BR>or in certain sorts of
situations. It is a responsibility that is voluntarily<BR>accepted or
undertaken either generally where a general relationship, such<BR>as

specific-<BR>ally in relation to a particular transaction. In the

in the idea<BR>of a relationship that is equivalent to contract all
that is necessary to cover<BR>the situation that arises in this case.
Mr. Gardiner does not claim to<BR>succeed unless he can establish
that the reference was intended by the<BR>Respondents to be
communicated by the National Provincial Bank to some<BR>unnamed
customer of theirs, whose identity was immaterial to the

general<BR>relationship are those of solicitor and client and of
banker and customer.<BR>For the former <I>Nocton </I>v. <I>Ashburton
</I>has long stood as the authority and for<BR>the latter there is
the decision of Salmon, J. in <I>Woods </I>v. <I>Martins Bank<BR></I>which
I respectfully approve. There may well be others yet to be
established.<BR>Where there is a general relationship of this sort it
is unnecessary to do<BR>more than prove its existence and the duty
follows. Where, as in the present<BR>case, what is relied on is a

I have devoted much time and thought to considering the first<BR>reason
given by Mr. Foster for rejecting the Appellants' claim. I have<BR>done
so not only because his reason was based on a ground so
fundamental<BR>that it called for a full refutation, but also because
it is impossible to find<BR>the correct answer on the facts to the
Appellants' claim until the relevant<BR>criteria for ascertaining
whether or not there is a duty to take care have been<BR>clearly
established. Once that is done their application to the facts of

satisfied for the reasons I have given that a person for whose use<BR>a
banker's reference is furnished is not, simply because no
consideration<BR>has passed, prevented from contending that the
banker is responsible to<BR>him for what he has said. The question is
whether the Appellants can set<BR>up a claim equivalent to contract
and rely on an implied undertaking to<BR>accept responsibility. Mr.
Foster's second point is that in <I>Robinson </I>v.<BR><I>National
Bank of Scotland </I>this House has already laid it down as a
general<BR>rule that in the case of a banker furnishing a reference
that cannot be done.<BR>I do not agree. The facts in that case have
been stated by my noble and<BR>learned friend, Lord Reid, and I need
not repeat them. I think it is plain<BR>upon those facts that the
bank in that case was not furnishing the reference<BR>for the use of
the pursuer; he was not a person for whose use of the reference<BR>they
were undertaking any responsibility, and that quite apart from
their<BR>general disclaimer. Furthermore, the pursuer never saw the

I agree entirely with the<BR>reasoning and conclusion on this point

voluntarily to be undertaking a<BR>responsibility if at the very

he is not. The problem of reconciling words of exemption<BR>with the

would dismiss the appeal.</FONT></FONT></P>

arising out of<BR>&quot; that relationship other than the general
duty of honesty. But they do not<BR>&quot; say that where a different
sort of relationship ought to be inferred from<BR>&quot; the
circumstances the case is to be concluded by asking whether an
action<BR>&quot; for deceit will lie. I think that the authorities

it did. In reality the judgment covered only a part<BR>&quot; of the

besides that of honesty, the breach of which may give a right to
damages.<BR>&quot; These obligations depend on principles which the

Denning, L.J. in his dissenting judgment in <I>Candler </I>v. <I>Crane,
Christmas<BR>&amp; Co. </I>[1951] 2 K.B. 164 at page 179. He reached
the conclusion that in<BR>respect of reports and work that resulted
in such reports there was a duty of<BR>care laid on &quot;those
persons such as accountants, surveyors, valuers and<BR>&quot;
analysts, whose profession and occupation it is to examine books,
accounts<BR>&quot; and other things, and to make reports on which

whom they have heard nothing and to whom their employer<BR>without
their knowledge may choose to hand their accounts. &quot; The test
of<BR>&quot; proximity in these cases is : did the accountants know
that the accounts were<BR>&quot; required for submission to the
Plaintiff and use by him &quot;. (It is to be noted<BR>that these
expressions of opinion produce a result somewhat similar to
the<BR>Restatement para. 552.) I agree with those words. In my

argument. The true rule<BR>is that innocent misrepresentation <I>per
se </I>gives no right to damages. If the<BR>misrepresentation was
intended by the parties to form a warranty between<BR>two contracting
parties, it gives on that ground a right to damages <I>(Heilbutt,<BR>Symons
&amp; Co. </I>v. <I>Buckleton </I>[19131 A.C. 30). If an innocent
misrepresentation<BR>is made between parties in a fiduciary
relationship it may, on that ground,<BR>give a right to claim damages
for negligence. There is also, in my opinion,<BR>a duty of care
created by special relationships which though not fiduciary<BR>give
rise to an assumption that care as well as honesty is demanded.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Was there
such a special relationship in the present case as to impose on<BR>the
defendants a duty of care to the plaintiffs as the undisclosed
principals<BR>for whom the National Provincial Bank was making the
enquiry? The<BR>answer to that question depends on the circumstances
of the transaction.<BR>If, for instance, they disclosed a casual
social approach to the enquiry no<BR>such special relationship or
duty of care would be assumed (see <I>Fish </I>v.<BR><I>Kelly </I>144
E.R. 78, 83). To import such a duty the representation must<BR>normally,
I think, concern a business or professional transaction whose
nature<BR>makes clear the gravity of the enquiry and the importance
and influence<BR>attached to the answer. It is conceded that Salmon,
J., rightly found a duty<BR>of care in <I>Woods </I>v. <I>Martins
Bank, Ltd. </I>[1959] 1 Q.B. 55, but the facts in that<BR>case were
wholly different from those in the present case. A most
important<BR>circumstance is the form of the enquiry and of the
answer. Both were here<BR>plainly stated to be without liability. Mr.
Gardiner argues that those words<BR>are not sufficiently precise to
exclude liability for negligence. Nothing, how-<BR>ever, except
negligence could, in the facts of this case, create a liability
(apart<BR>from fraud to which they cannot have been intended to refer
and against<BR>which the words would be no protection since they
would be part of the<BR>fraud). I do not, therefore, accept that even
if the parties were already<BR>in contractual or other special
relationship the words would give no immunity<BR>to a negligent
answer. But in any event they clearly prevent a special<BR>relationship
from arising. They are part of the material from which one<BR>deduces
whether a duty of care and a liability for negligence was assumed.<BR>If
both parties say expressly (in a case where neither is deliberately
taking<BR>advantage of the other) that there shall be no liability, I
do not find it possible<BR>to say that a liability was assumed.</FONT></FONT></P>

But when a mere enquiry is made by<BR>&quot; one banker of another
who stands in no special relation to him, then, in<BR>&quot; the
absence of special circumstances from which a contract to be
careful<BR>&quot; can be inferred, I think there is no duty excepting
the duty of common<BR>&quot; honesty to which I have referred.&quot;
I appreciate Mr. Gardiner's emphasis<BR>on the general importance to
the business world of bankers' references and<BR>the desirability
that in an integrated banking system there should be a duty<BR>of
care with regard to them, but on the facts before us it is in my
