<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>I have had the advantage of
reading in draft the speech of my noble and<BR>learned friend, Lord
Roskill, and I am in full agreement with his conclusion<BR>and with
the reasons on which he bases it. I also gratefully adopt his<BR>summary
of the facts. It is enough for me to say that the
appellants<BR>(defenders) are specialist sub-contractors who laid
composition flooring in<BR>a factory that was built for the
respondents (pursuers) at Grangemouth<BR>between September 1969 and
May 1970. The respondents aver that the<BR>floor is defective, owing
to failure by the appellants to take reasonable<BR>care in laying it,
and that it will have to be replaced. There was no<BR>contractual
relationship between the appellants and the respondents, and<BR>for
some reason that has not been explained the respondents have
not<BR>taken legal proceedings against the main contractors with whom
they did<BR>have a contractual relationship. The respondents have
raised this action<BR>against the appellants, claiming damages which
consist mainly of the<BR>direct and indirect cost of replacing the
floor, the action being founded<BR>on averments that the appellants
were negligent in laying the floor. At<BR>the present stage of
relevancy these averments must be taken as true. The<BR>appeal raises
an important question on the law of delict or, strictly
speaking,<BR>quasi delict, which is not precisely covered by
authority. The question is<BR>whether the appellants having (as must
at this stage be assumed) negligently<BR>laid a floor which is
defective, but which has not caused danger to the<BR>health or safety
of any person nor risk of damage to any other property<BR>belonging
to the owner of the floor, may in the circumstances averred by<BR>the
respondents be liable for the economic loss caused to them by
having<BR>to replace the floor.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.29cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The Lord Ordinary (Lord Grieve)
and the Second Division answered<BR>that question in the affirmative,
and they have allowed to the respondents<BR>a proof before answer.
The appellants maintain that the question should<BR>be answered in
the negative and that the action should be dismissed as<BR>irrelevant.
As I agree with my noble and learned friend, Lord Roskill,<BR>that
the appeal fails I only add to his speech in order to deal in my
own<BR>words with two important matters that arise.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.31cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The first is the concern which has
been repeatedly expressed by judges<BR>in the United Kingdom and
elsewhere, that the effect of relaxing strict<BR>limitations upon the
area of liability for delict (tort) would be, in the<BR>words of
Cardozo J. to introduce &quot; liability in an indeterminate amount<BR>&quot;
for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class &quot;. This is
the flood-<BR>gates argument, if I may use the expression as a
convenient description,<BR>and not in any dismissive or
question-begging sense. The argument appears<BR>to me unattractive,
especially if it leads, as I think it would in this case,<BR>to
drawing an arbitrary and illogical line just because a line has to
be<BR>drawn somewhere. But it has to be considered, because it has
had a<BR>significant influence in leading judges to reject claims for
economic loss<BR>which were not consequent upon physical danger to
persons or other<BR>property of the pursuer/plaintiff. It was the
main reason for rejecting the<BR>claim in the Scottish case of

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>floodgates argument was much
discussed by the High Court of Australia<BR>in <I>Caltex Oil
(Australia) Pty. Ltd </I>v. <I>The Dredge &quot; Willemstad &quot;
</I>(1976) 136<BR>C.L.R. 529, where the majority of the court held
that there was sufficient<BR>proximity between the parties to justify
a claim for economic loss because<BR>the defendant knew (in the words
of the headnote) &quot; that a particular<BR>&quot; person, not
merely as a member of an unascertained class, [would] be<BR>&quot;
likely to suffer economic loss as a consequence of his
negligence&quot;.<BR>Whether the defenders' knowledge of the identity
of the person likely to<BR>suffer from his negligence is relevant for
the present purpose may with<BR>respect be doubted and it seems to be
contrary to the views expressed in<BR><I>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd.
</I>v. <I>Heller &amp; Partners Ltd. </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/4.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/4.html">[1964] AC 465</a></a> by<BR>Lord
Reid at 482 and by Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest at 494. But it is<BR>not
necessary to decide the question in this appeal because the
appellants<BR>certainly knew, or had the means of knowing, the
identity of the respon-<BR>dents for whom the factory was being
built. So if knowledge of the<BR>respondents' identity is a relevant
test, it is one that the appellants can<BR>satisfy. They can also
satisfy most, if not all, of the other tests that have<BR>been
suggested as safeguards against opening the floodgates. The
proximity<BR>between the parties is extremely close, falling only
just short of a direct<BR>contractual relationship. The injury to the
respondents was a direct and<BR>foreseeable result of negligence by
the appellants. The respondents, or<BR>their architects, nominated
the appellants as specialist sub-contractors and<BR>they must
therefore have relied upon their skill and knowledge. It would<BR>surely
be wrong to exclude from probation a claim which is so
strongly<BR>based, merely because of anxiety about the possible
effect of the decision<BR>upon other cases where the proximity may be
less strong. If and when<BR>such other cases arise they will have to
be decided by applying sound<BR>principles to their particular facts.
The present case seems to me to fall<BR>well within limits already
recognised in principle for this type of claim,<BR>and I would decide
this appeal strictly on its own facts. I rely particularly<BR>on the
very close proximity between the parties which in my view
disting-<BR>uishes this case from the case of producers of goods to
be offered for sale<BR>to the public.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.27cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.45cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The second matter which might be
thought to justify rejecting the<BR>respondents' claim as irrelevant
is the difficulty of ascertaining the standard<BR>of duty owed by the
appellants to the respondents. A manufacturer's duty<BR>to take care
not to make a product that is dangerous sets a standard which<BR>is,
in principle, easy to ascertain. The duty is owed to all who are
his<BR>&quot; neighbours&quot;. It is imposed upon him by the general
law and is in<BR>addition to his contractual duties to other parties
to the contract. It cannot<BR>be discharged or escaped by pleading
that it conflicts with his contractual<BR>duty. But a duty not to
produce a <I>defective </I>article sets a standard which<BR>is less
easily ascertained, because it has to be judged largely by
reference<BR>to the contract. As Windeyer J. said in <I>Voli </I>v.
<I>Inglewood Shire Council<BR></I>(1963) 110 C.L.R. 74, 85 if an
architect undertakes &quot;to design a stage<BR>&quot; to bear only
some specified weight, he would not be liable for the<BR>&quot;
consequences of someone thereafter negligently permitting a greater
weight<BR>to be put upon it.&quot; Similarly a building constructed
in fulfilment of a<BR>contract for a price of &pound;100,000 might
justly be regarded as defective,<BR>although the same building
constructed in fulfilment of a contract for a<BR>price of &pound;50,000
might not. Where a building is erected under a contract<BR>with a
purchaser, then provided the building, or part of it, is not
dangerous<BR>to persons or to other property and subject to the law
against misrepresenta-<BR>tion, I see no reason why the builder
should not be free to make with the<BR>purchaser whatever contractual
arrangements about the quality of the<BR>product the purchaser
wishes. However jerry-built the product, the<BR>purchaser would not
be entitled to damages from the builder if it came<BR>up to the
contractual standard. I do not think a subsequent owner could<BR>be
in any better position, but in most cases he would not know the
details<BR>of the contractual arrangements and, without such
knowledge, he might<BR>well be unable to judge whether the product
was defective or not. But in<BR>this case the respondents, although
not a party to the contract with the<BR>appellants, had full
knowledge of the appellants' contractual duties, and<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The respondents own and occupy a

a period in 1969 and 1970, under a contract<BR>between them and a
company called Ogilvie (Builders) Ltd. which I shall<BR>call &quot;
the main contractors &quot;. The respondents' architects nominated
the<BR>appellants as specialist sub-contractors for the purpose of
laying a floor in<BR>the main production area of the factory. The

the carrying out of this work.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>According to the respondents'
averments the appellants' workmanship was<BR>seriously defective in a
number of respects, with the result that after two<BR>years the floor
began to develop cracks over the whole of its surface. They<BR>say
that it requires replacement in order to avoid the necessity for
continual<BR>maintenance, which would be more expensive in the long
run. They claim<BR>against the appellants for the cost of such
replacement, together with certain<BR>consequential loss which they
say they will suffer while the work of<BR>replacement is being
carried out. The claim is founded in delict, the<BR>respondents
pleading that they have suffered loss through the
appellants'<BR>negligence and are entitled to reparation therefor.</FONT></FONT></P>

appellants now appeal to<BR>your Lordships' House.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.22cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>It is a notable feature of the
respondents' pleadings that they contain<BR>no averment that the
defective nature of flooring has led or is likely to lead<BR>to any
danger of physical injury to work people or of damage to
property,<BR>moveable or immoveable, other than the floor surface
itself, or even of<BR>economic loss through interruption of
production processes. The only type<BR>of pecuniary consequential
loss claimed for is that arising out of the need<BR>to replace the
flooring. Had there been an averment of any such<BR>apprehended
danger, I am of opinion that the respondents' case would have<BR>been
clearly relevant. There undoubtedly existed between the
appellants<BR>and the respondents such proximity of relationship,
within the well-known<BR>principle of <I>Donoghue </I>v. <I>Stevenson

standing in the requisite degree of proximity:<BR><I>Hedley Byrne &amp;
Co. Ltd </I>v. <I>Heller &amp; Partners Ltd </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/4.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1963/4.html">[1964] AC 465</a></a>.
That<BR>case was concerned with a negligent statement made in
response to an<BR>inquiry about the financial standing of a
particular company, in reliance on<BR>the accuracy of which the
plaintiffs had acted to their detriment. So the<BR>case is not in
point here except in so far as it established that
reasonable<BR>anticipation of physical injury to person or property
is not a <I>sine qua non<BR></I>for the existence of a duty of care.
It has also been established that where<BR>a duty of care exists
through the presence of such reasonable anticipation,<BR>and it is
breached, then even though no such injury has actually been
caused<BR>because the person to whom the duty is owed has incurred
expenditure in<BR>averting the danger, that person is entitled to
damages measured by the<BR>amount of that expenditure: <I>Anns v.
Merton London Borough Council<BR></I>[1968] A.C. 728, per Lord
Wilberforce at p.759. That is the principle which<BR>in my view
underlies <I>Dutton </I>v. <I>Bognor Regis U.D.C. </I>[1972] 1 Q.B.
373 and<BR><I>Batty </I>v. <I>Metropolitan Realisations Ltd </I>[1978]
1 Q.B. 554. So in the present<BR>case I am of opinion that the
appellants in the laying of the floor owed to<BR>the respondents a
duty to take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions<BR>which they
ought to have known would be likely to cause the respondents,<BR>not
only physical damage to person or property, but also pure economic
loss.<BR>Economic loss would be caused to the respondents if the
condition of the<BR>floor, in the course of its normal life, came to
be such as to prevent the<BR>respondents from carrying out ordinary
production processes on it, or,<BR>short of that, to cause the
production process to be more costly than it<BR>would otherwise have
been. In that situation the respondents would have<BR>been entitled
to recover from the appellants expenditure incurred in relaying<BR>the
floor so as to avert or mitigate their loss. The real question in
the<BR>appeal, as I see it, is whether the respondents' averments
reveal such a<BR>state of affairs as, under the principles I have
outlined, gives them a complete<BR>right of action. I am of opinion
that they have relevantly averred a duty<BR>of care owed to them by
the appellants, though I think their averments in<BR>this respect
might have been more precise and better related to the true<BR>legal
position. It is the averments of loss which cause me some trouble.<BR>On
the face of it, their averments might be read as meaning no more
than<BR>that the respondents have got a bad floor instead of a good
one and that<BR>their loss is represented by the cost of replacing
the floor. But they do also<BR>aver that the cost of maintaining the
floor which they have got is heavy,<BR>and that it would be cheaper
to take up the floor surface and lay a new one.<BR>If the cost of
maintaining the defective floor is substantially greater than
it<BR>would have been in respect of a sound one, it must necessarily
follow that<BR>their manufacturing operations are being carried on at
a less profitable level<BR>than would otherwise have been the case,
and that they are therefore<BR>suffering economic loss. That is the
sort of loss which the appellants,<BR>standing in the relationship to
the respondents which they did, ought<BR>reasonably to have
anticipated as likely to occur if their workmanship was<BR>faulty.
They must have been aware of the nature of the respondents'<BR>business,
the purpose for which the floor was required, and the part it was<BR>to
play in their operations. The appellants accordingly owed
the<BR>respondents a duty to take reasonable care to see that their
workmanship<BR>was not faulty, and are liable for the foreseeable
consequences, sounding in<BR>economic loss, of their failure to do
so. These consequences may properly<BR>be held to include less
profitable operation due to the heavy cost of<BR>maintenance. In so
far as the respondents, in order to avert or mitigate<BR>such loss,
incur expenditure on relaying the floor surface, that
expenditure<BR>becomes the measure of the appellants' liability. Upon
that analysis of<BR>the situation, I am of opinion that the
respondents have stated a proper<BR>case for inquiry into the facts,
and that the Lord Ordinary and the Second<BR>Division were therefore
right to allow a proof before answer. I would<BR>accordingly dismiss
the appeal.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>a number of reasons why such an
extension would, in my view, be wrong<BR>in principle. In the first
place, I am unable to regard the deterioration of<BR>the flooring
which is alleged in this case as being damage to the
respondents'<BR>property such as to give rise to a liability falling
directly within the<BR>principle of <I>Donoghue </I>v. <I>Stevenson
(supra). </I>The flooring had an inherent<BR>defect in it from the
start. The appellants did not, in any sense consistent<BR>with the
ordinary use of language or contemplated by the majority in<BR><I>Donoghue
</I>v. <I>Stevenson, </I>damage the respondents' property. They
supplied<BR>them with a defective floor. Such an act can, in
accordance with the views<BR>I have expressed above, give rise to
liability in negligence in certain<BR>circumstances. But it does not
do so merely because the flooring is defective<BR>or valueless or
useless and requires to be replaced. So to hold would raise<BR>very
difficult and delicate issues of principle having a wide
potential<BR>application. I think it would necessarily follow that
any manufacturer of<BR>products would become liable to the ultimate
purchaser if the product,<BR>owing to negligence in manufacture was,
without being harmful in any way<BR>useless or worthless or defective
in quality so that the purchaser wasted<BR>the money he spent on it.
One instance mentioned in argument and<BR>adverted to by Stamp L.J.
in <I>Dutton </I>v. <I>Bognor Regis U.D.C. (supra) </I>at<BR>p.415,
was a product purchased as ginger beer which turned out to be
only<BR>water, and many others may be figured. To introduce a general
liability<BR>covering such situations would be disruptive of
commercial practice, under<BR>which manufacturers of products
commonly provide the ultimate purchaser<BR>with limited guarantees
usually undertaking only to replace parts exhibiting<BR>defective
workmanship and excluding any consequential loss. There being<BR>no
contractual relationship between manufacturer and ultimate
consumer,<BR>no room would exist, if the suggested principle were
accepted, for limiting<BR>the manufacturer's liability. The policy
considerations which would be<BR>involved in introducing such a state
of affairs appear to me to be such as a<BR>court of law cannot
properly assess, and the question whether or not it<BR>would be in
the interests of commerce and the public generally is, in my<BR>view,
much better left for the legislature. The purchaser of a
defective<BR>product normally can proceed for breech of contract
against the seller who<BR>can bring his own supplier into the
proceedings by third party procedure,<BR>so it cannot be said that
the present state of the law is unsatisfactory from<BR>the point of
view of available remedies. I refer to <I>Young &amp; Marten Ltd
</I>v.<BR><I>McManus Childs Ltd </I>[1969] 1 A.C. 454. In the second
place, I can foresee<BR>that very considerable difficulties might
arise in assessing the standards of<BR>quality by which the allegedly
defective product is to be judged. This<BR>aspect is more fully
developed in the speech to be delivered by my noble<BR>and learned
friend Lord Brandon of Oakbrook with whose views on the<BR>matter I
respectfully agree.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>My Lords, since the appeal comes
before your Lordships' House in the<BR>manner I have just stated, it
follows that the respondents' averments, alleged<BR>not to state a
relevant case, must be assumed for present purposes to be<BR>correct.
Those averments are fully set out in the record and in the opinion<BR>of
the Lord Ordinary and to avoid repetition, I gratefully borrow
his<BR>statement of them. I need only summarise the bare essentials.
The appellants<BR>are specialist contractors in the laying of
flooring. They were nominated<BR>sub-contractors under a main
building contract concluded between the<BR>respondents and some main
contractors. There was no privity of contract<BR>between the
appellants and the respondents. The appellants laid flooring in<BR>the
production area of a factory which was being built for the
respondents<BR>at Grangemouth as long ago as 1969 and 1970. In 1972
it is averred that<BR>that flooring showed defects allegedly due
either to bad workmanship or bad<BR>materials or both. At the time
the pleadings were prepared no repair work<BR>had been carried out
but it was averred that the cost of repairs would be<BR>some &pound;50,000
to which added certain figures which, as the Lord Ordinary<BR>said,
might reasonably be described as items of economic or financial
loss.<BR>The total sum claimed by the respondents was over &pound;200,000.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.21cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.45cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>My Lords, your Lordships are thus
invited to deal with events which<BR>happened long ago. It is
difficult to believe that in the intervening period<BR>some work has
not been done to this flooring but no information was<BR>vouchsafed
as to the course of subsequent events. The main building<BR>contract
was not exhibited in the courts below. Your Lordships were not<BR>told
whether that contract included as between the main contractors and
the<BR>respondents any relevant exceptions clause, nor whether if
there were such<BR>an exceptions clause it might be available for the
benefit of the appellants.<BR>Nor were your Lordships told why the
respondents had chosen to proceed<BR>in delict against the appellants
rather than against the main contractors in<BR>contract, nor indeed
why the main contractors had not been joined as parties<BR>to these
proceedings. This economy of fact is in stark contrast to the
wealth<BR>of citation of authority of which your Lordships have had
the benefit. Thus<BR>the bare point of law has to be decided upon an
assumption of the truth<BR>of the facts pleaded. But I cannot but
suspect that the truth regarding the<BR>supposed deficiencies of this
flooring at Grangemouth has long since been<BR>either established or
disproved. Of those matters however your Lordships<BR>know and have
been told nothing. Half a century ago your Lordships'<BR>House
decided <I>Donoghue </I>v. <I>Stevenson </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/uk/cases/UKHL/1931/3.html"><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/100.html">[1932] AC 562</a></a> upon a
similar plea of<BR>irrelevancy. In that case however some three and
three quarter years only<BR>had elapsed between the purchase of the
allegedly offending bottle of ginger<BR>beer and the decision of your

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>My Lords, there was much
discussion before your Lordships' House as to<BR>the effect of the
pleadings. I see no need to discuss them in detail. They<BR>seem to
me clearly to contain no allegation that the flooring was in
a<BR>dangerous state or that its condition was such as to cause
danger to life or<BR>limb or to other property of other persons or
that repairs were urgently or<BR>imminently required to avoid any
such danger, or that any economic or<BR>financial loss had been, or
would be, suffered save as would be consequential<BR>upon the
ultimate replacement of the flooring, the necessity of which
was<BR>averred in Condescendence VII. The essential feature of the
respondents<BR>pleading was that it advanced a claim for the cost of
remedying the alleged<BR>defects in the flooring itself by
replacement together with resulting or<BR>economic or financial loss
consequential upon that replacement.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>My Lords, it was because of that
scope of the respondents' pleading and<BR>that that pleading was
limited in this way that the appellants were able to<BR>mount their
main attack upon those pleadings and to contend that they were,<BR>at
least in the absence of amendment, for which no leave has been sought
at<BR>any stage, irrelevant since the law neither of Scotland nor of
England made<BR>the appellants liable in delict or in negligence for
the cost of replacing this<BR>flooring or for the economic or
financial loss consequent upon that<BR>replacement. It was
strenuously argued for the appellants that for your<BR>Lordships'
House now to hold that in those circumstances which I have<BR>just
outlined the appellants were liable to the respondents would be to
extend<BR>the duty of care owed by a manufacturer and others, to whom
the principles<BR>first enunciated in <I>Donoghue </I>v. <I>Stevenson
</I>have since been extended during<BR>the last half century, far
beyond the limits to which the courts have hitherto<BR>extended them.
The familiar &quot; floodgates&quot; argument was once again<BR>brought
fully into play. My Lords, although it cannot be denied that
policy<BR>considerations have from time to time been allowed to play
their part in the<BR>last century and the present either in limiting
or in extending the scope of the<BR>tort of negligence since it first
developed as it were in its own right in the<BR>course of the last
century, yet today I think its scope is best determined
by<BR>considerations of principle rather than of policy. The &quot;
floodgates&quot;<BR>argument is very familiar. It still may on
occasion have its proper place but<BR>if principle suggests that the
law should develop along a particular route and<BR>if the adoption of
that particular route will accord a remedy where that<BR>remedy has
hitherto been denied, I see no reason why, if it be just that the<BR>law
should henceforth accord that remedy, that remedy should be
denied<BR>simply because it will, in consequence of this particular
development become<BR>available to many rather than to few.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>My Lords, I think there is no
doubt that <I>Donoghue </I>v. <I>Stevenson </I>by its<BR>insistence
upon proximity, in the sense in which Lord Atkin used that word,<BR>as
the foundation of the duty of care which was there enunciated, marked
a<BR>great development in the law of delict and of negligence alike.
In passing<BR>it should be noted that Lord Atkin emphasised at page
579 of the report that<BR>the laws of Scotland and of England were in
that case, as is agreed in the<BR>present, identical. But that
advance having been thus made in 1932, the<BR>doctrine then
enunciated was at first confined by judicial decision
within<BR>relatively narrow limits. The gradual development of the
law will be found<BR>discussed by the learned editor of <I>Salmond on
Torts </I>(18th edition 1981) at<BR>pages 289 et seq. Though
initially there is no doubt that because of Lord<BR>Atkin's
phraseology at page 599 of the report in <I>Donoghue v. Stevenson,<BR></I>&quot;
Injury to the consumer's life or property &quot; it was thought that
the duty of<BR>care did not extend beyond avoiding physical injury or
physical damage<BR>to the person or the property of the person to
whom the duty of care was<BR>owed, that limitation has long since
ceased as Professor Heuston points out<BR>in the passage to which I

<I>Greystoke Castle (Cargo Owners) </I>[1947] A.C. 265, is<BR>sometimes
overlooked. The facts were essentially simple. Two ships<BR>collided.
For simplicity I will call them A and B. Both ships were to

ship A became<BR>liable to contribution in general average to the

of repairs or diminution in value. This argument was
expressly<BR>rejected by Lord Denning M.R. at page 396 and by Sachs

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot; The submission is, I think,
a formidable one and in my view raises<BR>&quot; the most difficult
point for decision in this case. Nor can I see any<BR>&quot; valid
distinction between the case of a builder who carelessly builds<BR>&quot;
a house which, though not a source of danger to person or property,<BR>&quot;
nevertheless, owing to a concealed defect in its foundations starts
to<BR>&quot; settle and crack and becomes valueless, and the case of
a manufacturer<BR>&quot; who carelessly manufactures an article
which, though not a source of<BR>&quot; danger to a subsequent owner
or to his other property, nevertheless<BR>&quot; owing to a hidden
defect quickly disintegrates. To hold that either<BR>&quot; the
builder or the manufacturer was liable except in contract would<BR>&quot;
be to open up a new field of liability the extent of which could
not,<BR>&quot; I think, be logically controlled, and since it is not
in my judgment<BR>&quot; necessary to do so for the purposes of this
case I do not, more<BR>&quot; particularly because of the absence of
the builder, express an opinion<BR>&quot; whether the builder has a
higher or lower duty than the manufacturer.<BR>&quot; But the
distinction between the case of a manufacturer of a dangerous<BR>&quot;
thing which causes damage and that of a thing which turns out to be<BR>&quot;
defective and valueless lies, I think, not in the nature of the
injury<BR>&quot; but in the character of the duty. I have a duty not
carelessly to put<BR>&quot; out a dangerous thing which may cause
damage to one who may<BR>&quot; purchase it; but the duty does not
extend to putting out carelessly a<BR>&quot; defective or useless or
valueless thing. So again one goes back to<BR>&quot; consider what
was the character of the duty, if any, owed to the<BR>&quot;
plaintiff, and one finds on authority that the injury which is one of
the<BR>&quot; essential elements of the tort of negligence is not
confined to physical<BR>&quot; damage to personal property but may
embrace economic damage<BR>&quot; which the plaintiff suffers through
buying a worthless thing, as is<BR>&quot; shown by the <I>Hedley

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>My Lords, in the first of this
trilogy, the Supreme Court by a majority<BR>held that the
manufacturer of a dangerously defective article is not liable<BR>in
tort to an ultimate consumer or user of that article for the cost
of<BR>repairing damage arising in the article itself nor for such
economic loss as<BR>would have been sustained in any event as a
result of the need to effect<BR>repairs. But there was, if I may
respectfully say so, a powerful dissenting<BR>judgment by Laskin J.
(as he then was) with which Hall J. concurred. The<BR>learned judge
posed as the first question (page 549) whether the
defendants'<BR>liability for negligence should embrace economic loss
where there has been<BR>no physical harm in fact. He gave an
affirmative answer. After pointing<BR>out (at page 551) that the
judicial limitation on liability was founded upon<BR>what I have
called &quot; the floodgates &quot; argument rather than upon
principle,<BR>he adopted the view that economic loss resulting from
threatened physical<BR>loss from a negligently designed or
manufactured product was recoverable.<BR>It was this judgment which
my noble and learned friend Lord Wilberforce<BR>described in his
speech in <I>Anns </I>as of strong persuasive force&mdash;see
pages<BR>759/60. In the <I>Caltex </I>case, the High Court of
Australia elaborately<BR>reviewed all the relevant English
authorities and indeed others as well.<BR>My Lords, I hope I shall
not be thought lacking in respect for those elaborate<BR>judgments or
failing to acknowledge the help which I have derived from<BR>them if
I do not cite from them for to some extent certain of the
difficulties<BR>there discussed have been subsequently resolved by
the decision of this<BR>House in <I>Anns. </I>In <I>Bowen, </I>to
which Lord Wilberforce also referred in<BR><I>Anns </I>as having
afforded him much assistance, the Court of Appeal in New<BR>Zealand
followed the Court of Appeal decision in <I>Button. </I>Cooke J.
took<BR>the view that it was enough for the purpose of the case in
question to say<BR>that the damage was basically physical. But as the
passage at page 423<BR>of the report shows, he would have been
prepared in agreement with the<BR>judgments of Lord Denning M.R. and
of Sachs L.J. In <I>Dutton </I>to go<BR>further.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>My Lords, to my mind in the
instant case there is no physical damage<BR>to the flooring in the
sense in which that phrase was used in <I>Dutton, Batty<BR></I>and
<I>Bowen </I>and some of the other cases. As my noble and learned
friend,<BR>Lord Russell of Killowen, said during the argument, the
question which your<BR>Lordships' House now has to decide is whether
the relevant Scots and<BR>English law today extends the duty of care
beyond a duty to prevent harm<BR>being done by faulty work to a duty
to avoid such faults being present in<BR>the work itself. It was
powerfully urged on behalf of the appellants that<BR>were your
Lordships so to extend the law a pursuer in the position of
the<BR>pursuer in <I>Donoghue </I>v. <I>Stevenson </I>could in
addition to recovering for any<BR>personal injury suffered have also
recovered for the diminished value of the<BR>offending bottle of
ginger beer. Any remedy of that kind it was argued<BR>must lie in
contract and not in delict or tort. My Lords, I seem to detect<BR>in
that able argument reflections of the previous judicial approach
to<BR>comparable problems before <I>Donoghue </I>v. <I>Stevenson </I>was
decided. That<BR>approach usually resulted in the conclusion that in
principle the proper<BR>remedy lay in contract and not outside it.
But that approach and its<BR>concomitant philosophy ended in 1932 and
for my part I should<BR>be reluctant to countenance its re-emergence
some 50 years later in the<BR>instant case. I think today the proper
control lies not in asking whether the<BR>proper remedy should lie in
contract or instead in delict or tort, not in<BR>somewhat capricious
judicial determination whether a particular case falls<BR>on one side
of the line or the other, not in somewhat artificial

principles<BR>that the ability to control the extent of liability in
delict or in negligence<BR>lies. The history of the development of
the law in the last 50 years shows<BR>that fears aroused by the &quot;
floodgates &quot; argument have been unfounded.<BR>Cooke J. in <I>Bowen

Earlier, in July 1968, the pursuers' architects had nominated the
defenders<BR>as sub-contractors to lay flooring, consisting of a
magnesium oxychloride<BR>composition, in the production area of the
factory. 3 The pursuers'<BR>architects, in so nominating the
defenders, had relied on the fact that the<BR>defenders were
specialists in the laying of flooring. 4. The defenders had<BR>accepted
the nomination and, after entering into a contract with the
main<BR>contractors, laid flooring of the specified composition in
the specified area.<BR>5. It was the duty of the defenders to mix and
lay the flooring with reasonable<BR>care. 6. The defenders were in
breach of that duty in that they failed, in a<BR>number of respects,
to mix and lay the flooring with reasonable care. 7. In<BR>consequence
of that breach of duty by the defenders the flooring began to<BR>develop
cracks in 1972 and had gone on cracking more and more ever since.<BR>8.
As a result of the cracking of the flooring the pursuers suffered
the<BR>following items of damage or loss: necessary relaying or

the carrying out of the work &pound;1,000;<BR>removal of machinery to

If that were the question to be decided in the present case, I<BR>should
have no hesitation in holding that, in principle and depending on<BR>the
facts of a particular case, purely pecuniary loss may be
recoverable<BR>in an action founded on delict alone. Two examples can

necessary to bring the facts of that situation within those of
previous<BR>&quot; situations in which a duty of care has been held
to exist. Rather<BR>&quot; the question has to be approached in two
stages. First one has to<BR>&quot; ask whether, as between the
alleged wrongdoer and the person who<BR>&quot; has suffered damage
there is a sufficient relationship of proximity<BR>&quot; or
neighbourhood such that, in the reasonable contemplation of the<BR>&quot;
former, carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage to<BR>&quot;
the latter&mdash;in which case a <I>prima facie </I>duty of care
arises. Secondly,<BR>&quot; if the first question is answered
affirmatively, it is necessary to consider<BR>&quot; whether there
are any considerations which ought to negative, or to<BR>&quot;

principle to the present case, it is,<BR>as I indicated earlier,
common ground that the first question which Lord<BR>Wilberforce said

owed by the one to the other, falls to be answered in the
affirmative.<BR>Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a greater degree

always been<BR>either stated expressly, or taken for granted, that an

existence of danger, or the threat<BR>of danger, of physical damage
to persons or their property, excluding for<BR>this purpose the very

expressed above, the relevant contract or<BR>contracts can be
regarded in order to establish the standard or standards of<BR>quality
by which the question of defectiveness falls to be judged, and if
such<BR>contract or contracts happen to include provisions excluding
or limiting<BR>liability for defective products or defective work, or
for negligence generally,<BR>it seems that the party sued in delict
should in justice be entitled to rely on<BR>such provisions. This

unprecedented<BR>and, as I think, wholly undesirable extensions of
the existing law of delict.</FONT></FONT></P>

duty of care contended for by the defenders<BR>is accepted, the
standard of defectiveness presents no problem at all. The<BR>sole

rise to a danger<BR>of physical damage to persons or their property,
other than the product<BR>concerned itself.</FONT></FONT></P>
