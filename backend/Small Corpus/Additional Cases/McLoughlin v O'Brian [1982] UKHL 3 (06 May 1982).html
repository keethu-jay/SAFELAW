<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 12pt">This
appeal arises from a very serious and tragic road accident
which<BR>occurred on 19th October 1973 near Withersfield, Suffolk.
The appellant's<BR>husband, Thomas McLoughlin, and three of her
children, George, aged 17,<BR>Kathleen, aged 7 and Gillian, nearly 3,
were in a Ford motor car: George<BR>was driving. A fourth child,
Michael, then aged 11, was a passenger in a<BR>following motor car
driven by Mr. Pilgrim: this car did not become involved<BR>in the
accident. The Ford car was in collision with a lorry driven by
the<BR>first respondent and owned by the second respondent. That
lorry had been<BR>in collision with another lorry driven by the third
respondent and owned<BR>by the fourth respondent. It is admitted that
the accident to the Ford car<BR>was caused by the respondents'
negligence. It is necessary to state what<BR>followed in full detail.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.23cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.45cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 12pt">As a
result of the accident, the appellant's husband suffered bruising
and<BR>shock; George suffered injuries to his head and face, cerebral
concussion,<BR>fractures of both scapulae and bruising and abrasions;
Kathleen suffered<BR>concussion, fracture of the right clavicle,
bruising, abrasions and shock;<BR>Gillian was so seriously injured
that she died almost immediately.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.22cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.45cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 12pt">At the
time, the appellant was at her home about two miles away; an hour<BR>or
so afterwards the accident was reported to her by Mr. Pilgrim, who
told<BR>her that he thought George was dying, and that he did not
know the<BR>whereabouts of her husband or the condition of her
daughter. He then<BR>drove her to Addenbrooke's hospital, Cambridge.
There she saw Michael,<BR>who told her that Gillian was dead. She was
taken down a corridor and<BR>through a window she saw Kathleen,
crying, with her face cut and<BR>begrimed with dirt and oil. She
could hear George shouting and screaming.<BR>She was taken to her
husband who was sitting with his head in his hands.<BR>His shirt was
hanging off him and he was covered in mud and oil. He saw<BR>the
appellant and started sobbing. The appellant was then taken to
see<BR>George. The whole of his left face and left side was covered.
He appeared<BR>to recognise the appellant and then lapsed into
unconsciousness. Finally,<BR>the appellant was taken to Kathleen who
by now had been cleaned up.<BR>The child was too upset to speak and
simply clung to her mother. There<BR>can be no doubt that these
circumstances, witnessed by the appellant, were<BR>distressing in the
extreme and were capable of producing an effect going<BR>well beyond
that of grief and sorrow.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 12pt">The
appellant subsequently brought proceedings against the
respondents.<BR>At the trial, the judge assumed, for the purpose of
enabling him to decide<BR>the issue of legal liability, that the
appellant subsequently suffered the<BR>condition of which she
complained. This was described as severe shock,<BR>organic depression
and a change of personality. Numerous symptoms of a<BR>physiological
character are said to have been manifested. The details<BR>were not
investigated at the trial, the court being asked to assume that
the<BR>appellant's condition had been caused or contributed to by
shock, as distinct<BR>from grief or sorrow, and that the appellant
was a person of reasonable<BR>fortitude.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3 STYLE="font-size: 12pt">On these
facts, or assumed facts, the trial judge (Boreham J.) gave<BR>judgment
for the respondents holding, in a most careful judgment reviewing<BR>the
authorities, that the respondents owed no duty of care to the
appellant<BR>because the possibility of her suffering injury by
nervous shock, in the<BR>circumstances, was not reasonably
foreseeable.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>On appeal by the appellant, the
judgment of Boreham J. was upheld,<BR>but not on the same ground.
Stephenson L.J. took the view that the<BR>possibility of injury to
the appellant by nervous shock <I>was </I>reasonably<BR>foreseeable
and that the respondents owed the appellant a duty of care.<BR>However,
he held that considerations of policy prevented the appellant
from<BR>recovering. Griffiths L.J. held that injury by nervous shock
to the appellant<BR>was &quot; readily foreseeable &quot; but that
the respondents owed no duty of care<BR>to the appellant. The duty
was limited to those on the road nearby.<BR>Cumming-Bruce L.J. agreed
with both judgments. The appellant now<BR>appeals to this House. The
critical question to be decided is whether a<BR>person in the
position of the appellant, i.e. one who was not present at the<BR>scene
of grievous injuries to her family but who comes upon those
injuries<BR>at an interval of time and space, can recover damages for
nervous shock.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>Although we continue to use the
hallowed expression &quot; nervous shock &quot;,<BR>English law, and
common understanding, have moved some distance since<BR>recognition
was given to this symptom as a basis for liability. Whatever<BR>is
unknown about the mind-body relationship (and the area of
ignorance<BR>seems to expand with that of knowledge), it is now
accepted by medical<BR>science that recognisable and severe physical
damage to the human body<BR>and system may be caused by the impact,
through the senses, of external<BR>events on the mind. There may thus
be produced what is as identifiable<BR>an illness as any that may be
caused by direct physical impact. It is safe<BR>to say that this, in
general terms, is understood by the ordinary man or<BR>woman who is
hypothesised by the courts in situations where claims for<BR>negligence
are made. Although in the only case which has reached this<BR>House
<I>(Bourhill </I>v. <I>Young </I>[19431 A.C. 92) a claim for damages
in respect<BR>of &quot; nervous shock&quot; was rejected on its
facts, the House gave clear<BR>recognition to the legitimacy, in
principle, of claims of that character. As<BR>the result of that and
other cases, assuming that they are accepted as<BR>correct, the
following position has been reached:</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>Throughout these developments, as
can be seen, the courts have proceeded<BR>in the traditional manner
of the common law from case to case, upon a<BR>basis of logical
necessity. If a mother, with or without accompanying<BR>children,
could recover on account of fear for herself, how can she be<BR>denied
recovery on account of fear for her accompanying children? If
a<BR>father could recover had he seen his child run over by a backing
car, how<BR>can he be denied recovery if he is in the immediate
vicinity and runs to<BR>the child's assistance? If a wife and mother
could recover if she had<BR>witnessed a serious accident to her
husband and children, does she fail<BR>because she was a short
distance away and immediately rushes to the<BR>scene? (cf. <I>Benson
</I>v. <I>Lee, </I>U.S.). I think that unless the law is to draw<BR>an
arbitrary line at the point of direct sight and sound, these
arguments<BR>require acceptance of the extension mentioned above
under 4 in the<BR>interests of justice.</FONT></FONT></P>

process of logical progression, it is hard<BR>to see why the present
plaintiff also should not succeed. She was not<BR>present at the
accident, but she came very soon after upon its aftermath.<BR>If,
from a distance of some 100 yards (cf. <I>Benson </I>v. <I>Lee) </I>she
had found<BR>her family by the roadside, she would have come within
principle 4 above.<BR>Can it make any difference that she comes upon
them in an ambulance,<BR>or, as here, in a nearby hospital, when, as
the evidence shows, they were<BR>in the same condition, covered with
oil and mud, and distraught with<BR>pain? If Mr. Chadwick can recover
when, acting in accordance with<BR>normal and irresistible human
instinct, and indeed moral compulsion, he<BR>goes to the scene of an
accident, may not a mother recover if. acting under<BR>the same
motives, she goes to where her family can be found?</FONT></FONT></P>

draw it would not appeal to most people's sense of justice. To
allow<BR>her claim may be, I think it is, upon the margin of what the
process of<BR>logical progression would allow. But where the facts

relief to those on<BR>or near the highway at or near the time of the

the view that although the injury to the<BR>plaintiff was

persons<BR>and owners of property on the road or near to it who might

ought to be limited at a certain point, or<BR>whether, with Griffiths
L.J., one says that the fact that consequences may be<BR>foreseeable

discounts accepted, there remains, in my opinion, just because<BR>&quot;
shock &quot; in its nature is capable of affecting so wide a range of
people,<BR>a real need for the law to place some limitation upon the
extent of<BR>admissible claims. It is necessary to consider three
elements inherent in any<BR>claim: the class of persons whose claims
should be recognised; the proximity<BR>of such persons to the
accident; and the means by which the shock is caused.<BR>As regards
the class of persons, the possible range is between the closest<BR>of
family ties&mdash;of parent and child, or husband and wife, and the
ordinary<BR>bystander. Existing law recognises the claims of the
first: it denies that of<BR>the second, either on the basis that such
persons must be assumed to be<BR>possessed of fortitude sufficient to
enable them to endure the calamities of<BR>modern life, or that
defendants cannot be expected to compensate the world<BR>at large. In
my opinion, these positions are justifiable, and since the
present<BR>case falls within the first class, it is strictly
unnecessary to say more. I<BR>think, however, that it should follow
that other cases involving less close<BR>relationships must be very
carefully scrutinised. I cannot say that they<BR>should never be
admitted. The closer the tie (not merely in relationship, but<BR>in
care) the greater the claim for consideration. The claim, in any
case, has<BR>to be judged in the light of the other factors, such as
proximity to the scene<BR>in time and place, and the nature of the
accident.</FONT></FONT></P>

the plaintiff through nervous shock<BR>resulting from the defendant's
conceded default. And, such foreseeability<BR>having been established
to their unanimous satisfaction, it followed that in<BR>law no other
course was open to the Court of Appeal than to allow this<BR>appeal.

<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.31cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.45cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The basic difficulty of the
subject arises from the fact that the crucial<BR>answers to the
questions which it raises lie in the difficult field of
psychiatric<BR>medicine. The common law gives no damages for the
emotional distress<BR>which any normal person experiences when
someone he loves is killed or<BR>injured. Anxiety and depression are
normal human emotions. Yet an<BR>anxiety neurosis or a reactive
depression may be recognisable psychiatric<BR>illnesses, with or
without psychosomatic symptoms. So, the first hurdle<BR>which a
plaintiff claiming damages of the kind in question must surmount<BR>is
to establish that he is suffering, not merely grief, distress or any
other<BR>normal emotion, but a positive psychiatric illness. That is
here not in<BR>issue. A plaintiff must then establish the necessary
chain of causation in<BR>fact between his psychiatric illness and the
death or injury of one or more<BR>third parties negligently caused by
the defendant. Here again, this is not<BR>in dispute in the instant
case. But when causation in fact is in issue, it<BR>must no doubt be
determined by the judge on the basis of the evidence<BR>of
psychiatrists. Then, here comes the all important question. Given
the<BR>fact of the plaintiff's psychiatric illness caused by the
defendant's negligence<BR>in killing or physically injuring another,
was the chain of causation from<BR>the one event to the other,
considered <I>ex post facto </I>in the light of all that
has<BR>happened, &quot; reasonably foreseeable&quot; by the
&quot;reasonable man&quot;? A<BR>moment's thought will show that the
answer to that question depends on<BR>what knowledge is to be
attributed to the hypothetical reasonable man<BR>of the operation of
cause and effect in psychiatric medicine. There are at<BR>least two
theoretically possible approaches. The first is that the judge<BR>should
receive the evidence of psychiatrists as to the degree of
probability<BR>that the particular cause would produce the particular
effect, and apply<BR>to that the appropriate legal test of reasonable
foreseeability as the criterion<BR>of the defendant's duty of care.
The second is that the judge, relying on<BR>his own opinion of the
operation of cause and effect in psychiatric medicine,<BR>as fairly
representative of that of the educated layman, should treat
himself<BR>as the reasonable man and form his own view from the
primary facts as<BR>to whether the proven chain of cause and effect
was reasonably foreseeable.<BR>In principle, I think there is much to
be said for the first approach.<BR>Foreseeability, in any given set
of circumstances, is ultimately a question<BR>of fact. If a claim in
negligence depends on whether some defect in a<BR>complicated piece
of machinery was foreseeably a cause of injury, I<BR>apprehend that
the judge will decide that question on the basis of the<BR>expert
evidence of engineers. But the authorities give no support to
this<BR>approach in relation to the foreseeability of psychiatric
illness. The judges,<BR>in all the decisions we have been referred
to, have assumed that it lay<BR>within their own competence to
determine whether the plaintiff's &quot;nervous<BR>&quot; shock&quot;
(as lawyers quaintly persist in calling it), was in any
given<BR>circumstances a sufficiently foreseeable consequence of the
defendant's act<BR>or omission relied on as negligent to bring the
plaintiff within the scope<BR>of those to whom the defendant owed a
duty of care. To depart from<BR>this practice and treat the question
of foreseeable causation in this field,<BR>and hence the scope of the
defendant's duty as a question of fact to be<BR>determined in the
light of the expert evidence adduced in each case, would,<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

be too large an innovation in the law to be regarded as
properly<BR>within the competence, even since the liberating 1966
Practice Direction,<BR>of your Lordships' House. Moreover,
psychiatric medicine is far from<BR>being an exact science. The
opinions of its practitioners may differ widely.<BR>Clearly it is
desirable in this, as in any other field, that the law should<BR>achieve
such a measure of certainty as is consistent with the demands
of<BR>justice. It would seem that the consensus of informed judicial
opinion is<BR>probably the best yardstick available to determine
whether, in any given<BR>circumstances, the emotional trauma
resulting from the death or injury of<BR>third parties, or indeed the
threat of such death or injury, <I>ex hypothesi<BR></I>attributable
to the defendant's negligence, was a foreseeable cause in law,<BR>as

psycho-<BR>somatic illness. But the word I would emphasise in the
foregoing sentence<BR>is &quot; informed &quot;. For too long earlier
generations of judges have regarded<BR>psychiatry and psychiatrists
with suspicion, if not hostility. Now, I venture<BR>to hope, that
attitude has quite disappeared. No judge who has spent any<BR>length
of time trying personal injury claims in recent years would
doubt<BR>that physical injuries can give rise not only to organic but
also to psychiatric<BR>disorders. The sufferings of the patient from
the latter are no less real<BR>and frequently no less painful and
disabling than from the former. Like-<BR>wise, I would suppose that
the legal profession well understands that an<BR>acute emotional
trauma, like a physical trauma, can well cause a psychiatric<BR>illness
in a wide range of circumstances and in a wide range of
individuals<BR>whom it would be wrong to regard as having any
abnormal psychological<BR>make-up. It is in comparatively recent
times that these insights have come<BR>to be generally accepted by
the judiciary. It is only by giving effect to<BR>these insights in
the developing law of negligence that we can do justice<BR>to an
important, though no doubt small, class of plaintiffs whose
genuine<BR>psychiatric illnesses are caused by negligent defendants.</FONT></FONT></P>

if so, where that line is to be drawn.<BR>In thus formulating the
question, I do not, of course, use the word<BR>&quot; negligent &quot;

the current criterion of a defendant's duty of care,<BR>which,
however expressed in earlier judgments, we should now describe
as<BR>that of reasonable foreseeability. But. thirdly, in so far as

of that case the result was surely a<BR>foregone conclusion. The
pursuer was alighting from a tram when she<BR>heard, but did not see,
the impact of a collision between a motor-cyclist<BR>(on whose

motor-cyclist, a stranger to the pursuer, was killed. There is

in a question whether there is duty owing to members of the<BR>&quot;

on a normal standard of susceptibility. This, it may be said, is<BR>&quot;
somewhat vague. That is true, but definition involves limitation<BR>&quot;
which it is desirable to avoid further than is necessary in a

and is still in the stage<BR>&quot; of development. It is here, as
elsewhere, a question of what the<BR>&quot; hypothetical reasonable
man, viewing the position, I suppose ex<BR>&quot; post facto, would
say it was proper to foresee. What danger of<BR>&quot; particular
infirmity that would include must depend on all the<BR>&quot;

condition.<BR>&quot; if medical evidence is capable of defining it,
would be the standard.<BR>&quot; The test of the plaintiff's
extraordinary susceptibility, if unknown to<BR>&quot; the defendant,
would in effect make him an insurer. The lawyer<BR>&quot; likes to

the passage quoted above, was a decision of the High<BR>Court of
Australia. The plaintiff's seven year old son having been out

which<BR>continued for some hours. Eventually, in the presence of the
plaintiff,<BR>his mother, the child's dead body was recovered from a

fenced. The plaintiff<BR>claimed damages for &quot; nervous shock &quot;.
The majority of the court (Latham<BR>L.J., Rich and Starke JUJU.)
rejected the claim. The decision was based<BR>squarely on the ground
that the plaintiff's injury not being a foreseeable<BR>consequence of
the defendant's omission to fence the trench, they owed<BR>her no

herself and a breach of that duty. The duty which it<BR>&quot; is

injure her child so as to cause her a nervous shock when she saw,<BR>&quot;
not the happening of the injury, but the result of the injury,

to state the limit of<BR>&quot; the alleged duty. If a duty of the

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>My Lords, looking back I think it
is possible to discern that there only<BR>ever were two clear lines
of limitation of a defendant's liability for &quot; nervous<BR>&quot;shock&quot;
for which any rational justification could be advanced in the<BR>light,
both of the state of the law of negligence and the state of
medical<BR>science as judicially understood, at the time when those
limitations were<BR>propounded. In 1888 it was, no doubt, perfectly
sensible to say: &quot; Damages<BR>&quot;arising from mere sudden
terror unaccompanied by any actual physical<BR>&quot; injury, but
occasioning a nervous or mental shock, cannot ... be<BR>&quot;
considered a consequence which, in the ordinary course of things,<BR>&quot;
would flow from . . . negligence&quot;. Here the test, whether of
duty<BR>or of remoteness, can be recognised as a relatively distant
ancestor of the<BR>modern criterion of reasonable foreseeability.
Again, in 1901 it was, I<BR>would suppose, equally sensible to limit
a defendant's liability for &quot; nervous<BR>&quot; shock &quot;
which could &quot; reasonably or actually be expected &quot; to be
such<BR>as was suffered by a plaintiff who was himself physically
endangered by the<BR>defendant's negligence. But once that line of
limitation has been crossed,<BR>as it was by the majority in <I>Hambrook
</I>v. <I>Stokes Bros, </I>(u.s.), there can<BR>be no logical reason
whatever for limiting the defendant's duty to persons<BR>in physical
proximity to the place where the accident, caused by the<BR>defendant's
negligence, occurred. Much of the confusion in the authorities<BR>since
<I>Bourhill </I>v. <I>Young </I>(u.s.), including, if I may say so,
the judgments of<BR>the courts below in the instant case, has arisen,

whether the law should, as a matter of policy,<BR>define the
criterion of liability in negligence for causing psychiatric

with the question of liability<BR>of a defendant who is, <I>ex

danger which has in turn triggered the psychiatric illness. A
policy<BR>which is to be relied on to narrow the scope of the
negligent tortfeasor's<BR>duty must be justified by cogent and
readily intelligible considerations, and<BR>must be capable of
defining the appropriate limits of liability by reference<BR>to
factors which are not purely arbitrary. A number of policy
considerations<BR>which have been suggested as satisfying these
requirements appear to me,<BR>with respect, to be wholly
insufficient. I can see no ground whatever for<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>suggesting that to make the
defendant liable for reasonably foreseeable<BR>psychiatric illness
caused by his negligence, would be to impose a crushing<BR>burden on
him out of proportion to his moral responsibility. However<BR>liberally
the criterion of reasonable foreseeability is interpreted, both
the<BR>number of successful claims in this field and the quantum of
damages they<BR>will attract are likely to be moderate. I cannot
accept as relevant the<BR>well-known phenomenon that litigation may
delay recovery from a<BR>psychiatric illness. If this were a valid
policy consideration, it would lead<BR>to the conclusion that
psychiatric illness should be excluded altogether from<BR>the heads
of damage which the law will recognise. It cannot justify
limiting<BR>the cases in which damages will be awarded for
psychiatric illness by<BR>reference to the circumstances of its
causation. To attempt to draw a line<BR>at the furthest point which
any of the decided cases happen to have reached,<BR>and to say that
it is for the legislature, not the courts, to extend the limits<BR>of
liability any further, would be, to my mind, an unwarranted
abdication<BR>of the court's function of developing and adapting
principles of the common<BR>law to changing conditions, in a
particular corner of the common law which<BR>exemplifies, par
excellence, the important and indeed necessary part which<BR>that
function has to play. In the end I believe that the policy
question<BR>depends on weighing against each other two conflicting
considerations. On<BR>the one hand, if the criterion of liability is
to be reasonable foreseeability<BR><I>simpliciter, </I>this must,
precisely because questions of causation in psychiatric<BR>medicine
give rise to difficulty and uncertainty, introduce an element
of<BR>uncertainty into the law and open the way to a number of
arguable claims<BR>which a more precisely fixed criterion of
liability would exclude. I accept<BR>that the element of uncertainty
is an important factor. I believe that the<BR>&quot; floodgates&quot;
argument, however, is, as it always has been, greatly<BR>exaggerated.
On the other hand, it seems to me inescapable that any<BR>attempt to
define the limit of liability by requiring, in addition to
reasonable<BR>foreseeability, that the plaintiff claiming damages for
psychiatric illness<BR>should have witnessed the relevant accident,
should have been present at<BR>or near the place where it happened,
should have come upon its aftermath<BR>and thus have some direct
perception of it, as opposed to merely learning<BR>of it after the
event, should be related in some particular degree to the<BR>accident
victim&mdash;to draw a line by reference to any of these criteria
must<BR>impose a largely arbitrary limit of liability. I accept, of
course, the<BR>importance of the factors indicated in the guidelines
suggested by Tobriner<BR>J. in <I>Dillon </I>v. <I>Legg </I>(u.s.) as
bearing upon the <I>degree </I>of foreseeability of the<BR>plaintiff's
psychiatric illness. But let me give two examples to illustrate<BR>what
injustice would be wrought by any such hard and fast lines of
policy<BR>as have been suggested. First, consider the plaintiff who
learned after the<BR>event of the relevant accident. Take the case of
a mother who knows that<BR>her husband and children are staying in a
certain hotel. She reads in her<BR>morning newspaper that it has been
the scene of a disastrous fire. She<BR>sees in the paper a photograph
of unidentifiable victims trapped on the top<BR>floor waving for help
from the windows. She learns shortly afterwards<BR>that all her
family have perished. She suffers an acute psychiatric illness.<BR>That
her illness in these circumstances was a reasonably
foreseeable<BR>consequence of the events resulting from the fire is
undeniable. Yet. is the<BR>law to deny her damages as against a
defendant whose negligence was<BR>responsible for the fire simply on
the ground that an important link in the<BR>chain of causation of her
psychiatric illness was supplied by her imagination<BR>of the agonies
of mind and body in which her family died, rather than by<BR>direct
perception of the event? Secondly, consider the plaintiff who
is<BR>unrelated to the victims of the relevant accident. If rigidly
applied, an<BR>exclusion of liability to him would have defeated the
plaintiff's claim in<BR><I>Chadwick </I>v. <I>British Railways Board
</I>(u.s.). The Court of Appeal treated<BR>that case as in a special
category because Mr. Chadwick was a rescuer. Now,<BR>the special duty
owed to a rescuer who voluntarily places himself in physical<BR>danger
to save others is well understood, and is illustrated by <I>Haynes
</I>v.<BR><I>Harwood </I>[1935] 1 K.B. 146, the case of the constable
injured in stopping a<BR>runaway horse in a crowded street. But in
relation to the psychiatric<BR>consequences of witnessing such
terrible carnage as must have resulted from<BR></FONT></FONT><BR>

I have no doubt that this is an area of the law of negligence<BR>where
we should resist the temptation to try yet once more to freeze the

the application<BR>of the classic principles of negligence derived

succeed, in the interests of certainty, where the<BR>very
subject-matter is uncertain and continuously developing, or in
the<BR>interests of saving defendants and their insurers from the
burden of having<BR>sometimes to resist doubtful claims. I find
myself in complete agreement<BR>with Tobriner J. that the defendant's
duty must depend on reasonable<BR>foreseeability and &quot; must
necessarily be adjudicated only upon a case-by-case<BR>&quot; basis.
We cannot now pre-determine defendant's obligation in every<BR>&quot;
situation by a fixed category; no immutable rule can establish the
extent<BR>&quot; of that obligation for every circumstance of the
future&quot;. To put the<BR>matter in another way, if asked where the
thing is to stop, I should answer,<BR>in an adaptation of the
language of Lord Wright and Stephenson L.J.,<BR>&quot; where in the
particular case the good sense of the judge, enlightened by<BR>&quot;
progressive awareness of mental illness, decides.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
