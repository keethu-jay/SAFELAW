<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>In 1972 the appellants, the
Governors of the Peabody<BR>Donation Fund (&quot;Peabody&quot;)
decided to undertake the development<BR>for housing of a site known
as Knights Hill, in the London Borough<BR>of Lambeth. They engaged as
contractors for the project Sir<BR>Lindsay Parkinson &amp; Co. Ltd.
(&quot;the contractors&quot;) and as architects<BR>Austin Vernon &amp;
Partners (&quot;the architects&quot;). Consulting engineers<BR>were
also instructed.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.46cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.47cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The site of the development, which
was for 245 houses,<BR>presented certain problems. It required to be
terraced and the<BR>nature of the subsoil was London clay, which
tends to expand and<BR>contract with the seasons and to give rise to
movement. For this<BR>reason it was appreciated by the architects,
and the consulting<BR>engineers advising them, that the traditional
rigid type of drainage<BR>system was likely to be unsuitable for the
project, since there<BR>would be a high probability of failure, and
the architects therefore<BR>designed a system which incorporated
flexible joints between pipes<BR>at various critical points and
submitted plans for approval to the<BR>respondents, the London
Borough of Lambeth (&quot;Lambeth&quot;).</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The application was made on 6
April 1972, and an informal<BR>indication seems to have been given by
Lambeth that it was likely<BR>to be approved. Early in 1973 the
contractors were ready to<BR>begin the construction of the drainage
system. The architects'<BR>representative on the site was a trainee
architect named Mitchell.<BR>Lambeth had instructed a drainage
inspector named Marlow to<BR>carry out inspections of the drainage
installation. On 2 February<BR>1973 Mitchell and Marlow met and
agreed between themselves that<BR>in certain parts of the system the
planned flexible joints should be<BR>abandoned and fixed joints
substituted. On 7 February 1973,<BR>Mitchell wrote a letter to the
contractors' site agent, who had<BR>also been present at the meeting,
confirming the agreement to this<BR>variation. It does not appear
that either Mitchell or Marlow ever<BR>informed their respective
principals about what they had done. In<BR>the result, the trial
judge found, and the finding is not disputed by<BR>the appellants,
that Marlow had neither actual nor ostensible<BR>authority to agree
the variation so that Lambeth itself bears no<BR>responsibility for
his action.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.45cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>Very soon afterwards, on 14
February 1973, Lambeth,<BR>through their senior assistant director
(civil engineering), wrote to<BR>the architects intimating approval
in principle of the plans<BR>originally submitted by the latter, i.e.
those showing flexible joints<BR>throughout. However, the contractors
commenced the construction<BR>of drains incorporating rigid joints on
the lines agreed between<BR>Mitchell and Marlow.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=CENTER STYLE="margin-top: 1.48cm; margin-bottom: 0cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>- 2 -</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The next development was that
Marlow was superseded by<BR>another drainage inspector, named
Toogood, who had little<BR>experience in this field having previously
been employed as a<BR>plumber. He asked the contractors' site agent
for information<BR>about the nature of the drains which were being
constructed. The<BR>site agent wrote a letter, addressed to the
Lambeth Public Health<BR>Department and headed &quot;For the
attention of Mr. Toogood,&quot;<BR>indicating inter alia that runs
and connections into and abutting<BR>the dwelling houses were laid
with rigid joints. Toogood took no<BR>action on this letter and in
particular did not bring it to the<BR>attention of any of his
superiors in the department. Had he done<BR>so there can be no doubt
that steps would have been taken to<BR>ensure that flexible joints
were installed throughout the system.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.47cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The upshot was that construction
with fixed joints proceeded<BR>and in due course tests carried out in
late 1975 and early 1976<BR>revealed that many of the drains had
failed. Reconstruction was<BR>necessary, at a cost of some &pound;118,000,
completion of the<BR>development was delayed for about three years,
with consequent<BR>loss of rents for Peabody, and Peabody were faced
with substantial<BR>claims by the contractors for additional payments
said to be due<BR>to them because of the delay.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.47cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.47cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>In these circumstances, Peabody
started proceedings against<BR>the contractors, the architects and
Lambeth. Their case against<BR>the contractors was based on the
allegation that the failure of the<BR>drains was caused by faulty
workmanship. Against the architects<BR>it was alleged that they
failed to check the contractors' faulty<BR>workmanship and further
that they instructed the contractors to<BR>install drains lacking the
requisite flexible joints. In the event the<BR>claim against the
architects was compromised. As regards<BR>Lambeth the material
averment of negligence against them was in<BR>these terms:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.45cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.47cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Knowing that rigid drains
were being installed between the<BR>vertical stacks in the buildings
and the manholes following<BR>receipt of the said letter of 4 May
1973, thereafter failing<BR>to require flexibly jointed drains
wherever rigid drains had<BR>been or were to be installed.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.47cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The case came for trial on issues
of liability before Judge Oddie<BR>sitting as a deputy official
referee. On 24 January 1983 he gave<BR>judgment holding that,
although there had been some faulty<BR>workmanship on the part of the
contractors, this was not the<BR>cause of the failure of the drains,
and that the cause of the<BR>failure was the design change instructed
by Mitchell from flexible<BR>joints to rigid joints. He did not have
to deal with the claim<BR>against the architects since that, as
mentioned above, had been<BR>compromised. He went on to find that
Lambeth were liable in<BR>damages to Peabody on the ground of failure
to take steps to<BR>ensure that the drainage system as installed
complied with the<BR>design originally approved by them.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.48cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>Lambeth appealed to the Court of
Appeal against the latter<BR>part of the judgment, and on 29 July
1983 that court (Lawton, Fox<BR>and Slade L.JJ.) allowed the appeal
and reversed the decision of<BR>the trial judge. Peabody now appeal
to your Lordships' House.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>- 3 -</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>Peabody's case, in substance, is
that Lambeth were under a<BR>duty of care, owed to Peabody, when they
became aware through<BR>the letter of 4 May 1973 that the contractors
were installing<BR>drains with rigid joints, to invoke their powers
under paragraph 15<BR>of Part III of Schedule 9 to the Act of 1963 so
as to require a<BR>reversion to the flexible joint design which they
had previously<BR>approved. The duty is not said to be a statutory
one, but one<BR>that arose on common law principles because Lambeth
ought to<BR>have foreseen that, if they did not take steps to stop
the<BR>installation of drains with rigid joints, severe economic loss
would<BR>ensue to Peabody through the necessity at some future date
of<BR>taking up these drains and replacing them with others of
the<BR>approved design, as in fact happened.</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.41cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>It may be accepted that knowledge
of the contents of the<BR>letter of 4 May 1973 is to be imputed to
Lambeth. It was<BR>addressed to Lambeth's Public Health Department,
albeit for the<BR>attention of Mr. Toogood, and the latter was
clearly under a duty<BR>to bring it to the notice of higher
authority. It may also be<BR>accepted that Lambeth had power under
paragraph 15 of Part III<BR>of Schedule 9 to stop the unauthorised
installation. No doubt it<BR>would have been sufficient, in fact, to
draw to Peabody's attention<BR>that the rigid joints were
unauthorised. So the issue really comes<BR>to be whether Lambeth owed
a duty to Peabody to warn them<BR>that they were heading for
financial disaster.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>Lord Atkin's famous enunciation of
the general principles<BR>upon which the law of negligence is
founded, in <U>Donoghue v.<BR>Stevenson</U> <a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1932/100.html">[1932] AC 562</a>, 580, has
long been recognised as not<BR>intended to afford a<I> </I>comprehensive
definition, to the effect that<BR>every situation which is capable of
falling within the terms of the<BR>utterance and which results in
loss automatically affords a remedy<BR>in damages. Lord Reid said in
<U>Dorset Yacht Co. v. Home Office<BR></U><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1970/2.html">[1970] AC 1004</a>, 1027:</FONT></FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-top: 0.44cm; margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 0.46cm">
<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;It is not to be treated as
if it were a statutory definition.<BR>It will require qualification
in new circumstances. But I<BR>think that the time has come when we
can and should say<BR>that it ought to apply unless there is some
justification or<BR>valid explanation for its exclusion. For example,
causing<BR>economic loss is a different matter; for one thing, it
is<BR>often caused by deliberate action. Competition involves<BR>traders
being entitled to damage their rivals' interests by<BR>promoting
their own, and there is a long chapter of the law<BR>determining in
what circumstances owners of land can and<BR>in what circumstances
they may not use their proprietary<BR>rights so as to injure their
neighbours. But where<BR>negligence is involved the tendency has been
to apply<BR>principles analogous to those stated by Lord Atkin:
cf.<BR><U>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd, v. Heller &amp; Partners Ltd.</U>
[1964]<BR>A.C. 465. And when a person has done nothing to put<BR>himself
in any relationship with another person in distress or<BR>with his
property mere accidental propinquity does not<BR>require him to go to
that person's assistance. There may<BR>be a moral duty to do so, but
it is not practicable to make<BR>it a legal duty.&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

to establish that a duty of<BR>care arises in a particular situation,
it is not necessary to<BR>bring the facts of that situation within
those of previous<BR>situations in which a duty of care has been held
to exist.<BR>Rather the question has to be approached in two
stages.<BR>First one has to ask whether, as between the
alleged<BR>wrongdoer and the person who has suffered damage there
is<BR>a sufficient relationship of proximity or neighbourhood
such<BR>that, in the reasonable contemplation of the
former,<BR>carelessness on his part may be likely to cause damage
to<BR>the latter - in which case a prima facie duty of care
arises.<BR>Secondly, if the first question is answered affirmatively,
it<BR>is necessary to consider whether there are any<BR>considerations
which ought to negative, or to reduce or limit<BR>the scope of the
duty or the class of person to whom it is<BR>owed or the damages to
which a breach of it may give rise:<BR>see <U>Dorset Yacht</U> case

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>There has been a tendency in some
recent cases to treat<BR>these passages as being themselves of a
definitive character. This<BR>is a temptation which should be
resisted. The true question in<BR>each case is whether the particular
defendant owed to the<BR>particular plaintiff a duty of care having
the scope which is<BR>contended for, and whether he was in breach of
that duty with<BR>consequent loss to the plaintiff. A relationship of
proximity in<BR>Lord Atkin's sense must exist before any duty of care
can arise,<BR>but the scope of the duty must depend on all the
circumstances of<BR>the case. In <U>Dorset Yacht Co. v. Home Office</U>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Apart from this I would
conclude that, in the situation<BR>stipulated in the present case, it
would not only be fair and<BR>reasonable that a duty of care should
exist but that it<BR>would be contrary to the fitness of things were
it not so. I<BR>doubt whether it is necessary to say, in cases where
the<BR>court is asked whether in a particular situation a
duty<BR>existed, that the court is called upon to make a decision
as<BR>to policy. Policy need not be invoked where reason and<BR>good
sense will at once point the way. If the test as to<BR>whether in
some particular situation a duty of care arises<BR>may in some cases
have to be whether it is fair and<BR>reasonable that it should so
arise, the court must not shrink<BR>from being the arbiter. As Lord

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>In the instant case Peabody, the
owners of the building site<BR>and the undertakers of the development
thereon, bore<BR>responsibility, under paragraph 13 of Part III of
Schedule 9 to the<BR>Act of 1963, for securing that the drains
conformed to the design<BR>approved by Lambeth. Mr. Dyson, for
Peabody, brought to the<BR>attention of the House certain drainage
byelaws made by the<BR>Greater London Council in 1962 under the
statutory predecessor of<BR>the Act of 1963. These undoubtedly place
certain very specific<BR>obligations upon contractors carrying out
building operations, but<BR>they do nothing to detract from what is
clearly the proper<BR>construction of paragraph 13(1), namely, that
observance of its<BR>provisions is incumbent upon any person who puts
in train a house<BR>building project. Peabody no doubt had no
personal knowledge or<BR>understanding of what was going on. They
relied on the advice of<BR>their architects, engineers and
contractors, and in the event they<BR>were sadly let down,
particularly by the architects. But it would<BR>be neither reasonable
nor just, in these circumstances, to impose<BR>upon Lambeth a
liability to indemnify Peabody against loss<BR>resulting from such
disastrous reliance.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The purpose for which the powers
contained in paragraph 15<BR>of Part III of Schedule 9 have been
conferred on Lambeth is not<BR>to safeguard building developers

houses built in the local<BR>authority's area, and also members of
the public generally, against<BR>dangers to their health which may
arise from defective drainage<BR>installations. The provisions are
public health measures. In <U>Anns<BR>v. Merton London Borough

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;There is, In my opinion, no
difficulty about this. A<BR>reasonable man in the position of the
inspector must realise<BR>that if the foundations are covered in
without adequate<BR>depth or strength as required by the byelaws,
injury to<BR>safety or health may be suffered by owners or occupiers
of<BR>the house. The duty is owed to them - not to a

that these sums were not recoverable as<BR>economic loss pure and
simple, but as representing expenditure<BR>necessary to avert injury
to safety or health. The passage I have<BR>quoted from the speech of
Lord Wilberforce raises certain<BR>difficulties. In particular, it is
difficult to see how, having regard<BR>to the scope of the duty held

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>appear to be saying that the duty
is owed separately to owners<BR>and to occupiers. In fact, the
plaintiffs, as long lessees, were in<BR>substance both owners and
occupiers, and in my opinion the<BR>decision should be treated as
restricted to that situation. Further,<BR>the reference to &quot;a
negligent building owner, the source of his own<BR>loss&quot; to some
extent begs the question whether a duty is owed to<BR>the owner since
negligence on the part of a claimant does not<BR>necessarily, since
the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act<BR>1945, preclude
recovery of damages against a negligent defendant,<BR>though it may
reduce them. The question whether a building<BR>owner's negligence is
the sole cause of his loss raises a question<BR>of causation, not
liability. It is also to be observed that the basis<BR>upon which the
measure of damages was arrived at would present<BR>difficulties in
the case of a claim by one occupying upon terms<BR>which did not
permit of his carrying out any alterations to the<BR>structure of the
house. The solution of these difficulties is not,<BR>however,
necessary to the determination of the instant appeal. It<BR>is
sufficient to hold that Lambeth owed no duty to Peabody to<BR>activate
their paragraph 15 powers, notwithstanding that they<BR>might
reasonably have foreseen that failure to do so would result<BR>in
economic loss to Peabody, because the purpose of avoiding such<BR>loss
was not one of the purposes for which these powers were<BR>vested in
them. I find myself in respectful agreement with the<BR>following
passage in the judgment of Slade L.J. in the court below<BR>[1983] 3

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>&quot;Can it have been the
intention of the legislature, in<BR>conferring on a borough council
power to enforce against a<BR>defaulting site owner requirements made
by it in accordance<BR>with paragraph 13 of Part III of Schedule 9,
to protect such<BR>owner against damage which he himself might suffer
through<BR>his own failure to comply with such requirements? In
my<BR>opinion, this question can only be answered in the
negative.<BR>This particular power exists for the protection of
other<BR>persons - not for that of the person in default. I
say<BR>nothing about the case where a local authority have failed<BR>to
make known their requirements or where they have made<BR>requirements
of an inadequate or defective nature.<BR>However, I can see no
justification for extending the law of<BR>negligence by imposing on a
local authority, over and above<BR>their public law powers and duties
under paragraphs 13 and<BR>15, a duty to exercise their powers of
enforcement under<BR>paragraph 15(2), owed in private law towards a
site owner,<BR>who, whether with or without personal negligence,
disregards<BR>the proper requirements of the local authority, duly
made<BR>under paragraph 13 and duly communicated to him or<BR>persons
authorised to receive them on his behalf. The<BR>practical
implications of giving the defaulting owner a right<BR>to sue the

them so as to provide for<BR>foundations only 3 feet deep. The local
authority's building<BR>inspector instructed that the foundations
should be 5 feet deep in<BR>some places and 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet
deep elsewhere. The<BR>nature of the site was such that it was
necessary for stability that<BR>the foundations be 5 feet deep
overall. Defects developed in<BR>respect of which the tenants claimed
against the owners. The<BR>owners sued the architects for damages for
negligence and breach<BR>of contract, and the architects joined the
local authority as third<BR>parties, claiming contribution. The
action against the architects<BR>was compromised, but their claim for
contribution proceeded to<BR>trial. The trial judge held that the
local authority were liable for<BR>breach of a duty of care owed to
the owners, and assessed their<BR>contribution at 25 per cent. His
decision was affirmed by the<BR>Court of Appeal. Stephenson L.J.,

owed a duty of care to a building<BR>developer to see that his
property did not suffer damage, even<BR>though there was no question
of apprehended injury to the health<BR>or safety of the developer.
Donaldson L.J. expressed a similar<BR>view, as did Sir David Cairns.

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The second case to which I have
referred is <U>Dennis v.<BR>Charnwood Borough Council</U> [1983] Q.B.
409. The facts were that<BR>in 1955 the plaintiffs commissioned a
builder to construct a house<BR>for their own occupation upon a site
which consisted partly of an<BR>infilled sand pit. Plans were
submitted to the local authority<BR>under byelaws which corresponded
in material respects with<BR>paragraph 13 of Part III of Schedule 9
to the Act of 1963. The<BR>plans snowed the foundation to consist of
a concrete raft and were<BR>duly approved by the local authority.
This was in fact an<BR>unsuitable foundation for the site, and many
years later subsidence<BR>led to serious cracking of the structure.
The plaintiffs sued the<BR>statutory successors of the local
authority for damages on the<BR>ground of negligence in passing plans
indicating an inadequate<BR>foundation, and judgment in their favour
was given by Forbes J.<BR>and affirmed by the Court of Appeal
(Lawton, Templeman and Fox<BR>L.JJ.). The argument turned principally
upon whether the trial<BR>judge's conclusions on liability were
justified on the evidence, and<BR>also upon the question of
limitation. Templeman L.J., delivering<BR>the leading judgment, did
not find it necessary to give any<BR>elaborate consideration to the
