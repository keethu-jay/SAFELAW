this case are quite complex. They are set out very fully<BR>in the
judgment of Glidewell L.J. in the Court of Appeal, and it
is<BR>unnecessary to rehearse them in detail in order to identify the
most important<BR>issue of law which arises on the appeal to this
House, which is whether one<BR>who supplies a defamatory reference
about a person in response to a request<BR>from a concern with which
that person is seeking employment is liable in<BR>negligence to the
subject of the reference if it has been compiled without<BR>reasonable

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is, however,
necessary for an understanding of the manner in which<BR>the issue
arises to give a brief outline of the salient facts. The plaintiff,
Mr.<BR>Spring, was in 1989 employed by the third defendants
(&quot;Corinium&quot;) as sales<BR>director (designate) and office
manager at their premises in Cirencester.<BR>Corinium were estate
agents and were also agents for the sale of insurance<BR>policies
issued by the first defendants (&quot;Guardian Assurance&quot;) of
which they<BR>were an &quot;appointed representative&quot; within the
meaning of section 44 of the<BR>Financial Services Act 1986, and thus
authorised to carry on investment<BR>business. On 22 July 1988 Mr.
Spring was appointed a &quot;company<BR>representative&quot; of
Guardian Assurance and was thus authorised, in accordance<BR>with
rule 1.2. of the Lautro Rules 1988, to sell Guardian insurance
policies<BR>and to advise on their merits. Lautro is the Life
Assurance and Unit Trust<BR>Regulatory Organisation, the
self-regulatory body of the industry set up under<BR>the Act of 1986.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">On 7 July 1989
the major shareholder in Corinium sold the company<BR>to Guardian
Assurance, which appointed a Mr. Siderfin to be its chief<BR>executive.

Mr.<BR>Parker, sought to go into business in Dursley, near
Cirencester, selling the<BR>policies of another insurance company,
and to this end he approached the<BR>Scottish Amicable Life Assurance

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;Mr.
Spring held the position of Sales Manager until he was<BR>asked to
leave in August of this year. His former superior has stated<BR>in
writing that he was seen by some of the sales staff as a person
who<BR>consistently kept the best leads for himself with little
regard for the<BR>sales team that he supposedly was to manage; and
his former superior<BR>has further stated that he is a man of little
or no integrity and could not<BR>be regarded as honest. . . . Since
the 1st January 1989, Messrs.<BR>Spring and Parker shared all their
commission earnings on a 50:50<BR>basis and left owing the company
some &pound;12,000 in funding which to<BR>date has not been repaid.
This matter is now in the hands of<BR>solicitors. The current lapse
ratio is running at 18 per cent. and this<BR>is only for policies
written since March of this year. Since their<BR>departure, we have
found a serious case of mis-selling where the<BR>concept of 'best
advice' was ignored and the policies sold yielded the<BR>highest
commissions. Gre personnel have had to visit the investor to<BR>rectify
the situation. There have been other cases where there has<BR>been
bad advice but there is no current evidence to indicate whether<BR>it
was deliberate or through ignorance.&quot;</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

Amicable naturally declined to appoint Mr. Spring as one of<BR>its
company representatives. Mr. Spring applied to two other companies
for<BR>such an appointment, but each of them received from Guardian
Assurance a<BR>reference in the same terms, which led to their
refusing his application.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>The reference was compiled by a
Mrs. Debra Lee-Moore, who was<BR>assistant chief compliance officer
of the fourth defendants (&quot;Gre Assurance&quot;).<BR>She relied
for the purpose principally upon information given to her by
Mr.<BR>Siderfin. by a Mr. Beard, who was a member of a Gre Assurance
compliance<BR>team which had paid a visit to Corinium in November
1989, and by a Mr.<BR>Dixon, who was senior sales consultant for Gre
Assurance in Gloucester. The<BR>statement that Mr. Spring could not
be regarded as honest came from Mr.<BR>Siderfin (&quot;his former
superior&quot;), and that about a serious case of mis-selling<BR>came
from Mr. Beard and Mr Dixon. The case in question involved a
Mr.<BR>Fennell, to whom Mr. Spring had sought to sell a highly
unsuitable policy<BR>which would have generated a very large
commission for him. The trial judge<BR>found that in so doing Mr.
Spring had acted incompetently, and not<BR>dishonestly with the
object of securing a substantial commission. The trial<BR>judge
further found in relation to the reference that Mrs. Lee-Moore
had<BR>accurately stated what she had learnt from her sources of
information and that<BR>she was not guilty either of malice or of
negligence. He went on to find that<BR>neither Mr. Siderfin or Mr.
Dixon had acted out of malice, in respect that<BR>each of them
genuinely believed in the truth of the allegations he was making,<BR>hut
that each of them had failed to exercise reasonable care in respect
of the<BR>allegations through making them without carrying out a
thorough investigation<BR>into their truth. Such an investigation, he
found, would have shown that Mr.<BR>Spring had not acted dishonestly.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=3>Mr. Spring raised an action of
damages against all tour defendants<BR>pleading causes of action in
malicious falsehood, breach of contract and<BR>negligence. The trial
judge, Judge Lever Q.C.. rejected the claim in<BR>malicious
falsehood, following his finding that none of the persons involved<BR>in
the giving of the reference had acted maliciously. As regards the
claim for<BR>breach of contract he held that there was no contract
between Mr. Spring and<BR>either Guardian Assurance or GRE Assurance
and that there was not to be<BR>implied into the contract between Mr.
Spring and Corinium a term that any<BR>reference given about him
should be prepared with reasonable care. He found<BR>in favour of Mr.
Spring, however, on the claim founded on negligence, with<BR>damages
to be assessed. On appeal by the defendants his judgment was
set<BR>aside by the Court of Appeal (Glidewell and Rose L.JJ. and Sir
Christopher<BR>Slade) on 10 December 1992 ([1993] 2 All E.R. 273).
Mr. Spring now<BR>appeals to your Lordships' House, but only on the
issues concerned with<BR>negligence and with breach of contract.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">My Lords, if no
reasons of policy intervened there might be much to<BR>be said for
the view that Mr. Spring is entitled to succeed in his claim based<BR>on

damage to<BR>him would result if the reference were prepared without
reasonable care and<BR>it thus incorrectly disparaged him. that there
was proximity between him and<BR>those who prepared the reference,
and that it would be fair, just and<BR>reasonable to impose a duty of
care on the latter. This would, however,<BR>extend the ambit of

as a general rule English law gives effect to the<BR>ninth
commandment that a man shall not speak evil falsely of his<BR>neighbour.
It supplies a temporal sanction: if he cannot prove that<BR>defamatory
matter which he published was true, he is liable in<BR>damages to
whomever he has defamed, except where the publication<BR>is oral
only, causes no damage and falls outside the categories of<BR>slander
actionable per se. The public interest that the law should<BR>provide
an effective means whereby a man can vindicate his reputation<BR>against
calumny has nevertheless to be accommodated to the competing<BR>public
interest in permitting men to communicate frankly and freely<BR>with
one another about matters in respect of which the law recognises<BR>that
they have a duty to perform or an interest to protect in doing
so.<BR>What is published in good faith on matters of these kinds is
published<BR>on a privileged occasion. It is not actionable even
though it be<BR>defamatory and turns out to be untrue. With some
exceptions which<BR>are irrelevant to the instant appeal, the
privilege is not absolute but<BR>qualified. It is lost if the
occasion which gives rise to it is misused.<BR>For in all cases of
qualified privilege there is some special reason of<BR>public policy
why the law accords immunity from suit - the existence<BR>of some
public or private duty, whether legal or moral, on the part of<BR>the
maker of the defamatory statement which justifies his<BR>communicating
it or of some interest of his own which he is entitled<BR>to protect
by doing so. If he uses the occasion for some other reason<BR>he
loses the protection of the privilege.&quot;</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

occasion on which<BR>that was done was a privileged one in the sense
in which that expression is<BR>used in the context of defamation law.
If liability in negligence were to<BR>follow from a reference
prepared without reasonable care, the same adverse<BR>consequences
would flow as those sought to be guarded against by the defence<BR>of
qualified privilege. Those asked to give a reference would be

the adverse consequences likely<BR>to flow from such an extension in
the type of case before him. If the ambit<BR>of negligence were
extended to cover the son of circumstances that exist in<BR>the
present case, the consequences would be no less deleterious. The
purpose<BR>of the defence of qualified privilege is to encourage
frankness. Although in<BR>many instances the encouragement of
frankness may operate only in the<BR>interests of the particular
person to whom the communication is made, in<BR>many other instances
it is necessary for the protection of the wider public. In<BR>the
present case that is the position. The purpose of Lautro rule 3.5(2)
is to<BR>protect the public against being exposed to the activities
of company<BR>representatives selling insurance policies who may be
dishonest or<BR>incompetent. The need for that has been amply
demonstrated by the many<BR>instances of mis-selling that have
recently been uncovered by Lautro. If there<BR>exists some suspicion
that a person in respect of whom a reference has been<BR>asked for
has not acted with complete integrity, the public interest
requires<BR>that such suspicion should be communicated. If liability
for negligence<BR>towards the subject of the reference were to be
held to exist, there would be<BR>a temptation not to communicate the
suspicion. In the present case it required<BR>a protracted trial with

probabilities acted incompetently but not dishonestly. An inquiry<BR>of
comparable scope would not be within the powers of the
ordinary<BR>employer. Faced with the possibility of an action of
damages for negligence<BR>at the instance of the subject of the
reference there are grounds for expecting<BR>that the employer would
be inhibited from expressing frankly any reservations<BR>which he
might have about the honesty of the employee. Another field
of<BR>employment where frankness is of the greatest importance is
that where<BR>contact with children is involved. It may be very
difficult to prove that a<BR>person has interfered with young
children, yet there may be grounds for<BR>suspecting it. The public
interest demands that the existence of such suspicion<BR>should not
be suppressed. In general, precisely the same grounds of
public<BR>policy which make the defence of qualified privilege
available in an action for<BR>defamation strongly favour the
exclusion of an action of damages for<BR>negligence in similar
situations. If it were to be held that such an action was<BR>to be
available in relation to the giving of references in the employment
field,<BR>there would be pressure to extend the principle to cover
all situations where<BR>the defence of qualified privilege would be
available if the action were one for<BR>defamation, and such

hereafter, I have come to the conclusion that, on the<BR>facts of the
present case, both Guardian Assurance and Corinium owed a duty<BR>of
care to the appellant in respect of the preparation of the reference
in<BR>question. In my opinion, the source of duty of care lies in the
principle<BR>derived from <I>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Heller &amp;
Partners Ltd. </I>[1964] A.C.<BR>465, viz. an assumption of
responsibility by those companies to the appellant<BR>in respect of
the reference, and reliance by the appellant upon the exercise
by<BR>them of due care and skill in respect of its preparation. I am
however<BR>concerned by the fact that the appellant's case was not
advanced to the<BR>Appellate Committee on the basis of that
principle. In these circumstances I<BR>would ordinarily have proposed
that, before the appeal could be decided on<BR>a point which had not
been argued, the parties should be given the opportunity<BR>of making
submissions upon it. In the present case, however. I understand<BR>chat
a majority of your Lordships are minded to allow the appeal in any

set out the reasoning upon which I, for my part, would allow
the<BR>appeal. I feel it necessary to do so because I have come to
the conclusion<BR>that, if the <I>Hedley Byrne </I>principle cannot
here be invoked, or a contractual<BR>term to that effect cannot be
relied upon by the appellant, the appeal ought to<BR>be dismissed;

the appellant's<BR>reputation. In such a case, in agreement with the

liability upon the respondents in<BR>negligence consistently with the
policy of the law established in the law of<BR>defamation in relation

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The wide scope
of the principle recognised in <I>Hedley Byrne </I>is reflected<BR>in
the broad statements of principle which I have quoted. All the
members<BR>of the Appellate Committee in this case spoke in terms of
the principle resting<BR>upon an assumption or undertaking of
responsibility by the defendant towards<BR>the plaintiff, coupled
with reliance by the plaintiff on the exercise by the<BR>defendant of
due care and skill. Lord Devlin, in particular, stressed that
the<BR>principle rested upon an assumption of responsibility when he
said, at p. 531<BR>that &quot;the essence of the matter in the
present case and in others of the same<BR>type is the acceptance of
responsibility.&quot; For the purpose of the case now<BR>before your
Lordships it is, I consider, legitimate to proceed on the same<BR>basis.
Furthermore, although <I>Hedley Byrne </I>itself was concerned with
the<BR>provision of information and advice, it is clear that the
principle in the case<BR>is not so limited and extends to include the
performance of other services. As<BR>for example the professional
services rendered by a solicitor to his client (see.<BR>in
particular. Lord Devlin at pp. 529-530). Accordingly where the
plaintiff<BR>entrusts the defendant with the conduct of his affairs,
in general or in<BR>particular, the defendant may be held to have
assumed responsibility to the<BR>plaintiff, and the plaintiff to have
relied on the defendant to exercise due skill<BR>and care, in respect
of such conduct.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

the inquiry in <I>Hedley Byrne </I>itself was directed, in a
case<BR>concerned with liability in respect of a negligent
misstatement (in fact a<BR>reference), to whether the maker of the
statement was liable to a recipient of<BR>it who had acted in
reliance upon it, may have given the impression that this<BR>is the
only way in which liability can arise under the principle in respect
of<BR>a misstatement. But. having regard to the breadth of the
principle as stated<BR>in <I>Hedley Byrne </I>itself. I cannot see
why this should be so. Take the case of<BR>the relationship between a
solicitor and his client, treated implicitly by<BR>Lord Morris and
expressly by Lord Devlin as an example of a relationship to<BR>which
the principle may apply. I can see no reason why a solicitor should
not<BR>he under a duty to his client to exercise due care and skill
when making<BR>statements to third parties, so that if he fails in
that duty and his client suffers<BR>damage in consequence, he may be
liable to his client in damages. The<BR>question whether a person who
gives a reference to a third party may, if the<BR>reference is
negligently prepared, be liable in damages not to the recipient
but<BR>to the subject of the reference, did not arise in <I>Hedley
Byrne </I>and so was not<BR>addressed in that case. That is the
central question with which we are<BR>concerned in the present case;

(i.e. subject to the point on defamation, which I will have<BR>to
consider later), it is my opinion that an employer who provides a
reference<BR>in respect of one of his employees to a prospective
future employer will<BR>ordinarily owe a duty of care to his employee
in respect of the preparation of<BR>the reference. The employer is
possessed of special knowledge, derived from<BR>his experience of the
employee's character, skill and diligence in the<BR>performance of
his duties while working for the employer. Moreover, when<BR>the
employer provides a reference to a third party in respect of his
employee,<BR>he does so not only for the assistance of the third
party, but also, for what it<BR>is worth, for the assistance of the
employee. Indeed, nowadays it must often<BR>be very difficult for an
employee to obtain fresh employment without the<BR>benefit of a
reference from his present or a previous employer. It is for
this<BR>reason that, in ordinary life, it may be the employee, rather
than a prospective<BR>future employer, who asks the employer to
provide the reference; and even<BR>where the approach comes from the
prospective future employer, it will (apart<BR>from special
circumstances) be made with either the express or the tacit<BR>authority
of the employee. The provision of such references is a

third party. In these<BR>circumstances, it seems to me that all the
elements requisite for the application<BR>of the <I>Hedley Byrne

be exercised by him in its<BR>preparation. Such a term may be implied

owes a duty of<BR>care to the recipient of the reference. The

reasons, subject to the point on defamation, I am satisfied<BR>that

the<BR>preparation of the reference. It is true that the preparation
of the reference<BR>was carried out not by employees of Guardian
Assurance, but by their parent<BR>company, G.R.E. Assurance (through
their assistant chief compliance officer,<BR>Mrs. Debra Lee-Moore,
assisted by Mr. Beard (a member of a G.R.E.<BR>Assurance compliance

others of the performance of the<BR>service, in respect of which they

their duty to the appellant to exercise due skill and<BR>care in the

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">In these
circumstances, it is probably academic whether a similar duty<BR>was
owed to the appellant by G.R.E. Assurance or Corinium. This
was<BR>however a case where three companies, all members of the same
group,<BR>collaborated in the preparation of the reference. In the
circumstances of the<BR>present case, I am satisfied that Corinium,
which not only collaborated in the<BR>preparation of the reference
but was formerly in a contractual relationship<BR>with the appellant
under a contract for services, with which the appellant's<BR>position
as Guardian Assurance's company representative was

responsibility to the appellant<BR>in respect of the preparation of
the reference so provided. I cannot however<BR>see any basis upon
which G.R.E. Assurance can be said to have assumed<BR>responsibility
to the appellant in respect of the preparation of the reference,<BR>even
though that company played the principal part in its preparation.
In<BR>these circumstances I am prepared to hold prima facie that
Corinium (as the<BR>employer of Mr. Siderfin) was under a duty of

inform the plaintiffs of the results of certain<BR>trials of a

can see no good reason why the duty to exercise due<BR>skill and care

which could only be<BR>defeated by proof of malice. It is not to be
forgotten that the <I>Hedley Byrne<BR></I>duty arises where there is
a relationship which is, broadly speaking, either<BR>contractual or
equivalent to contract. In these circumstances, I cannot see
that<BR>principles of the law of defamation are of any relevance.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

recognition of a duty of care to an employee in cases<BR>such as the

some<BR>inhibiting effect on the manner in which references are
expressed, in the sense<BR>that it may discourage employers from
expressing views such as those which<BR>are encouraged by rule 3.5(2)
of the Lautro Rules. For my part, however. I<BR>suspect that such an
inhibition exists in any event. Employers may well, like<BR>many
people, be unwilling to indulge in unnecessary criticism of
their<BR>employees: hence the perceived necessity for rule 3.5(2). In
all the<BR>circumstances, I do not think that we may fear too many
ill effects from the<BR>recognition of the duty. The vast majority of
employers will continue, as<BR>before, to provide careful references.
But those who, as in the present case,<BR>fail to achieve that
standard, will have to compensate their employees or<BR>former
employees who suffer damage in consequence. Justice, in my
opinion,<BR>requires that this should be done; and I, for my part,

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The defendants
have two main arguments. The first is that to confer<BR>on the
plaintiff a cause of action in negligence would distort and subvert
the<BR>law of defamation in cases where the defence relied on is one
of qualified<BR>privilege, that is, where, on an occasion when he has
either a duty to<BR>communicate information or a legitimate interest
of his own to protect, the<BR>defendant in good faith and without
malice defames the plaintiff. I believe<BR>that the answer to this
argument is that a person owes a general duty, subject<BR>to the
principles governing the law of defamation and to the relationship,
if<BR>any, between the defamer and the defamed, not to defame any
other person,<BR>whereas a liability based on negligent misstatement
can exist only if (1)<BR>damage is foreseeable (and damage occurs)
and (2) there is such proximity<BR>between the maker and the subject
of the misstatement as will impose a duty<BR>of care on the former
for the protection of the latter. The existence of
that<BR>foreseeability and that proximity between the plaintiff and
the defendant is a<BR>justification, not for <U>extending</U> the
liability for <U>defamation</U> by dispensing with<BR>the need for
malice, but for bringing into play a <U>different</U> principle of
liability<BR>according to which, in a restricted class of situations,
a plaintiff can rely on<BR><U>negligence</U> as the ingredient of the
defendant's conduct which is essential to<BR>the existence of that
liability. I consider that in the instant case damage<BR>stemming
from the defendants' careless misstatement when giving a
reference<BR><U>was</U> foreseeable and that the proximity between
the defendants and the plaintiff<BR>imposed a duty of care on the
former for the protection of the latter.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The defendants'
second argument (which in order that it may prevail,<BR>must be made
to stand independently on its own feet) is that, even if one<BR>concedes
foreseeability and proximity and even if it would otherwise be
just<BR>and reasonable for the plaintiff to recover under the head of
negligence, <U>public<BR>policy dictates</U> that the person who has
been the subject of a negligent<BR>misstatement shall not recover.
The argument is grounded on the proposition<BR>that the maker of the
misstatement, provided he has acted in good faith, must,<BR>even if
he has been negligent, be free to express his views in the kind
of<BR>situation (including the giving of any reference) which is
contemplated by the<BR>doctrine of qualified privilege which is part
of the law of defamation.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

considered on the assumption that, but for the<BR>overriding effect

argument entails not the resolution of<BR>a point of law but a

looms the probability, often amounting to a certainty,<BR>of damage

be irreparable. The entire future prosperity and happiness of
someone<BR>who is the subject of a damaging reference which is given
carelessly but in<BR>perfectly good faith may be irretrievably
blighted. Against this prospect is set<BR>the possibility that some
referees will be deterred from giving frank references<BR>or indeed
any references. Placing full reliance here on the
penetrating<BR>observations of my noble and learned friend Lord
Woolf, I am inclined to<BR>view this possibility as a spectre
conjured up by the defendants to frighten<BR>your Lordships into
submission. I also believe that the courts in general and<BR>your
Lordships' House in particular ought to think very carefully
before<BR>resorting to public policy considerations which will defeat
a claim that ex<BR>hypothesi is a perfectly good cause of action. It
has been said that public<BR>policy should be invoked only in clear
cases in which the potential harm to the<BR>public is incontestable,
that whether the anticipated harm to the public will be<BR>likely to
occur must be determined on tangible grounds instead of on
mere<BR>generalities and that the burden of proof lies on those who
assert that the court<BR>should not enforce a liability which prima
facie exists. Even if one should put<BR>the matter in a more neutral
way. I would say that public policy ought not to<BR>he invoked if the
arguments are evenly balanced: in such a situation the<BR>ordinary
rule of law. once established, should prevail.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

the giver of a reference owes no duty of care in the tort<BR>of
negligence to the subject of the reference. His duty to the
subject<BR>is governed by and lies in the tort of defamation. If it
were otherwise,<BR>the defence of qualified privilege in an action
for defamation where a<BR>reference was given, or the necessity for
the plaintiff to prove malice<BR>in an action for malicious
falsehood, would be bypassed. In effect, a<BR>substantial section of
the law regarding these two associated torts<BR>would be emasculated.
It follows that in our judgment Tudor Evans J.<BR>was wrong in <I>Lawton

the <I>Anns </I>case a series of decisions of the Privy Council<BR>and
of your Lordships' House, notably in judgments and speeches<BR>delivered
by Lord Keith of Kinkel, have emphasised the inability of<BR>any
single general principle to provide a practical test which can
be<BR>applied to every situation to determine whether duty of care is
owed<BR>and. if so. what is its scope... What emerges is that, in
addition to the<BR>foreseeability of damage, necessary ingredients in
any situation giving<BR>rise to a duty of care are that there should
exist between the party<BR>owing the duty and the party to whom it is
owed a relationship<BR>characterised by the law as one of 'proximity'
or 'neighbourhood' and<BR>that the situation should be one in which
the court considers it fair,<BR>just and reasonable that the law
should impose a duty of a given scope<BR>upon the one party for the
benefit of the other. But it is implicit in the<BR>passages referred
to that the concepts of proximity and fairness<BR>embodied in these
additional ingredients are not susceptible of any<BR>such precise
definition as would be necessary to give them untility as<BR>practical
tests, but amount in effect to little more than convenient<BR>labels

attaching greater significance to the<BR>more traditional

to the existence, the scope and the limits of the varied duties<BR>of

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">As to the first
question the starting point in my view is that the<BR>suggested claim
in negligence and the torts of defamation and injurious and<BR>malicious
falsehood do not cover the same ground, as Mr. Tony Weir shows<BR>in
his note in [1993] C.L.J. 376. They are separate torts, defamation
not<BR>requiring a proof by the plaintiff that the statement was
untrue (though<BR>justification may be a defence) or that he suffered
economic damage, but<BR>being subject to defences quite different
from those in negligence, such as the<BR>defence of qualified
privilege which makes it necessary to prove malice.<BR>Malicious
falsehood requires proof that the statement is false, that harm
has<BR>resulted and that there was express malice. Neither of these
involves the<BR>concept of a duty of care. The essence of a claim in
defamation is that a<BR>person's reputation has been damaged; it may
or not involve the loss of a job<BR>or economic loss. A claim that a
reference has been given negligently is<BR>essentially based on the
fact, not so much that reputation has been damaged,<BR>as that a job,
or an opportunity, has been lost. A statement carelessly made<BR>may
not be defamatory - a statement that a labourer is &quot;lame,&quot;
a secretary<BR>&quot;very arthritic,&quot; when neither statement is
true, though they were true of some<BR>other employee mistakenly
confused with the person named.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

consider that the existence of either of these two heads of<BR>claim,
defamation and injurious falsehood, a priori prevents the
recognition<BR>of a duty of care where, but for the existence of the
other two torts, it would<BR>be fair, just and reasonable to
recognise it in a situation where the giver of a<BR>reference has
said or written what is untrue and where he has acted<BR>unreasonably

reasons underlying the requirement that the defence of<BR>qualified

not<BR>necessarily apply in regard to a claim in negligence. There
may be other<BR>policy reasons in particular situations which should
prevail. Thus, in relation<BR>to a reference given by an employer in
respect of a former employee or a<BR>departing employee (and assuming
no contractual obligation to take care in<BR>giving a reference) it
is relevant to consider the changes which have taken<BR>place in the
employer/employee relationship, with far greater duties imposed<BR>on
the employer than in the past, whether by statute or by judicial

an employee will stand no chance of getting another job, let alone

necessarily true when the claim is laid<BR>in defamation even if on
an occasion of qualified privilege. In the case of an<BR>employee or

reference was given; the damage<BR>was clearly foreseeable: and it is
fair, just and reasonable in such an<BR>employment situation for the
law to recognise a duty on the part of the giver<BR>of the reference,
and the person who within the employer's organisation<BR>collates or
provides information for the purpose of preparing the reference,<BR>to
take reasonable care that the information was obtained and passed on

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">There remains
the question as to where there was a breach of duty in<BR>contract.
Although the learned judge found that there was no contract<BR>between
the appellant and Guardian Assurance, he really decided the claim
in<BR>contract on the basis that no term to exercise reasonable care
in the giving of<BR>a reference could be implied. Such a term was not
necessary for the business<BR>efficacy of the contract <I>(The
Moorcock </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="http://www.commonlii.org/uk/cases/UKLawRpPro/1889/8.html">(1889) 14 PD 64</a> and <I>Liverpool City<BR>Council v.
Irwin </I><a title="Link to BAILII version" href="/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1976/1.html">[1977] AC 239</a>, 266). It is not necessary in this case
to<BR>decide the general question as to whether an employer has an
implied duty to<BR>give a reference, though even if there is no
universal duty to do so it would<BR>seem to me that contracts may
exist when it is necessary to imply such a duty.<BR>That question
does not arise because here there was an express duty under
the<BR>Lautro Rules to give a reference, if the employer was asked by
another<BR>member of Lautro, but, more importantly a reference was in
fact given. The<BR>question is, thus, whether if a reference is given
there is a duty to exercise<BR>reasonable care in giving it.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

believed to be true to the other<BR>member or the [appointed]

reasonable care shall be taken in the making of such disclosure and
it is<BR>not necessary to decide whether such a duty of reasonable
care is to be<BR>implied as between the members of Lautro. The terms
of the obligation in<BR>rule 3.5(2) as between members of Lautro do
not exclude the possibility of a<BR>duty of care existing in the
contract between the appellant and one or other of<BR>the companies
by which he was employed. Accepting fully that the test
is<BR>&quot;necessity&quot; rather than &quot;reasonableness,&quot;
it seems to me that in view of the<BR>fact that an employee could
never get a job with another member or<BR>representative without a

this<BR>House in <I>Hedley Byrne &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Heller &amp;
Partners Ltd. </I>[1964]<BR>A.C. 465 to cover cases of pure economic
loss not resulting from<BR>physical damage has given rise to a
considerable and as yet unsolved<BR>difficulty of definition. The
opportunities for the infliction of<BR>pecuniary loss from the
imperfect performance of everyday tasks upon<BR>the proper
performance of which people rely for regulating their affairs<BR>are
illimitable and the effects are far-reaching. A defective bottle
of<BR>ginger beer may injure a single consumer but the damage stops
there.<BR>A single statement may be repeated endlessly with or
without the<BR>permission of its author and may be relied upon in a
different way by<BR>many different people. Thus the postulate of a
simple duty to avoid<BR>any harm that is, with hindsight, reasonably
capable of being foreseen<BR>becomes untenable without the imposition
of some intelligible limits to<BR>keep the law of negligence within
the bounds of common sense and<BR>practicality. Those limits have
been found by the requirement of what<BR>has been called a
'relationship of proximity' between plaintiff and<BR>defendant and by
the imposition of a further requirement that the<BR>attachment of
liability for harm which has occurred be 'just and<BR>reasonable.'
But although the cases in which the courts have imposed<BR>or
withheld liability are capable of an approximate categorisation,
one<BR>looks in vain for some common denominator by which the
existence<BR>of the essential relationship can be tested. Indeed it
is difficult to<BR>resist a conclusion that what have been treated as
three separate<BR>requirements are, at least in most cases, in fact
merely facets of the<BR>same thing, for in some cases the degree of
foreseeability is such that<BR>it is from that alone that the
requisite proximity can be deduced, whilst<BR>in others the absence
of that essential relationship can most rationally<BR>be attributed
simply to the court's view that it would not be fair and<BR>reasonable
to hold the defendant responsible. 'Proximity' is. no doubt,<BR>a
convenient expression so long as it is realised that it is no more
than<BR>a label which embraces not a definable concept but merely
a<BR>description of circumstances from which, pragmatically, the
courts<BR>conclude that a duty of care exists.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

'equivalent to contract,' that is, where there<BR>is an assumption of

529) Applying that guidance to the different<BR>situation of the
relationship between the person giving and the person who is<BR>the

can be<BR>drawn between cases where the subject of the reference is
an employee (I use<BR>that term hereafter to include a person engaged

v. Laing<BR></I>[1992] 2 N.Z.L.R. 282, the President again considered
the relationship<BR>between an action for defamation and negligence.
These cases involved<BR>actions for negligence against fire-loss
investigators, whose reports to the<BR>insurers had resulted in the
rejection of claims by the plaintiffs whose<BR>premises were damaged
by fire. To give an action for negligence in that<BR>situation the
President considered would mean &quot;by a side-wind the law
of<BR>defamation would be overthrown&quot; (at p. 302). Again, I
would not quarrel<BR>with the decision to strike out these claims
because as the President indicated<BR>&quot;the report of the
investigators [is] made pursuant to their contractual duty to<BR>the
insurer. ... I would therefore have reservations as to whether
there<BR>would be any duty owed to the plaintiffs in those cases.

I<BR>am afraid I do not accept the logic of the argument that to have
an action for<BR>negligence will undermine the law of defamation. If
this appeal is allowed,<BR>this will leave the law of defamation in
exactly the same state as it was<BR>previously. Mr. Spring would not
have succeeded in an action for<BR>defamation. Negligence has always
been an irrelevant consideration (I am not<BR>referring to quantum of

In the present context the two causes of action are not
primarily<BR>directed at the same mischief although they, admittedly,

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Courts of
Appeal in New Zealand and in this country both<BR>considered that the
necessary justification for excluding liability for negligence<BR>could
be found in the defence of qualified privilege. In support of
the<BR>importance of that defence Glidewell L.J. cited the powerful
language of Lord<BR>Diplock in <I>Horrocks v. Lowe </I>[1975] A.C.
135, 150, and I would not seek to<BR>qualify that language in a case
where a plaintiff is not in a position to establish<BR>that subject
to questions of public policy the defendant would be liable to
him<BR>for breach of a duty of care. When the defence of qualified
privilege was<BR>established such a duty of care was not in
contemplation. As Mr. Livesey<BR>Q.C. forcefully argued, it by no
means follows that so far as references are<BR>concerned the same
view should be taken of public policy as was taken when<BR><I>Whiteley
v. Adams </I>(1863) 15 C.B.(N.S.) 392 was decided.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">It is obviously
in accord with public policy that references should be<BR>full and
frank. It is also in accord with public policy that they should not
be<BR>based upon careless investigations. In the case of references
for positions of<BR>responsibility this is particularly important.
That is confirmed by the Lautro<BR>Rules. It has also to be accepted
that some referees may be more timid in<BR>giving full and frank
references if they feel there is a risk of their being found<BR>liable
for negligence. However, there is already such a possible liability
in<BR>respect of a negligently favourable reference, so all that
needs to be<BR>considered is the possible adverse consequences of a
negligently unfavourable<BR>reference. For reasons to which I have
already referred I consider there is<BR>little practical likelihood
of no reference at all being given nowadays.<BR>Certainly this could
not happen in the case of appointments to which the<BR>Lautro Rules
apply.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">However, the
real issue is not whether there would be any adverse<BR>effect on the
giving of references. Rather the issue is whether the adverse<BR>effects
when balanced against the benefits which would flow from giving
the<BR>subject a right of action sufficiently outweigh the benefits
to justify depriving<BR>the subject of a remedy unless he can
establish malice. In considering this<BR>issue it is necessary to
take into account contemporary practices in the field<BR>of
employment; the fact that nowadays most employment is conditional
upon<BR>a reference being provided. There are also the restrictions
on unfair dismissal<BR>which mean that an employee is ordinarily not
capable of being dismissed<BR>except after being told of what is
alleged against him and after he has been<BR>given an opportunity of
giving an explanation. This is also the widespread<BR>practice,
especially in the Civil Service, of having annual reports which
the<BR>subject is entitled to see - which practice, apparently even
in an ongoing<BR>employment situation, is not defeated by any lack of
candour. There is now<BR>an openness in employment relationships
which did not exist even a few years<BR>ago.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">A further
consideration mentioned by the President is the undesirability<BR>of
infringing freedom of speech. This is a consideration as least as
important<BR>to the common law as it is under the international
coventions by which it is<BR>also protected. Here it is necessary to
bear in mind that, as is the case with<BR>all fundamental freedoms,
the protection is qualified and not absolute.<BR>Freedom of speech
does not necessarily entitle the speaker to make a<BR>statement
without exercising reasonable care. Freedom of speech has to
be<BR>balanced against the equally well recognised freedom both at
common law and<BR>under the conventions that an individual should not
be deprived of the<BR>opportunity of earning his livelihood in his
chosen occupation. A<BR>development of the law which does no more
than protect an employee from<BR>being deprived of employment as a
result of a negligent reference would fully<BR>justify any limited
intrusion on freedom of speech.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

there remains to be considered whether it is preferable<BR>for the

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">As I indicated
earlier it is possible to approach this appeal as being<BR>primarily
one involving a contractual issue. This was the preferred approach<BR>of
Lord Bridge of Harwich in <I>Scally v. Southern Health and Social
Services<BR>Board </I>[1992] 1 A.C. 294, in a speech, with which
other members of the<BR>House agreed, from which I obtained singular
assistance. In that case. Lord<BR>Bridge stated the obverse of the
proposition that I have previously advanced<BR>when he said &quot;if
a duty of the kind in question was not inherent in the<BR>contractual
relationship, I do not see how it could possibly be derived from<BR>the
tort of negligence&quot; (at p. 303). In <I>Scally </I>it was decided
that where a<BR>contract of employment negotiated between employers
and a representative<BR>body contained a particular term conferring
on an employee a valuable<BR>contingent right to a pension of the
benefit of which he could not be expected<BR>to be aware unless the
term was brought to his attention, there was an implied<BR>obligation
on the employer to take reasonable steps to publicise that
term.<BR>Accordingly, when the employer failed to notify the employee
of his pension<BR>rights, which were therefore lost, he was entitled
to recover damages for<BR>breach of contract in respect of that loss.</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">In the course
of his speech. Lord Bridge drew a distinction &quot;between<BR>the
search for an implied term necessary to give business efficacy to
a<BR>particular contract and the search, based on wider
considerations, for a term<BR>which the law will imply as a necessary
incident of a definable category' of<BR>contractual relationship.&quot;
He also referred to the difficulty which would arise<BR>if the
implied term &quot;must necessarily be too wide in its ambit to be
acceptable<BR>as of general application&quot;. He indicated that he
believed that &quot;this difficulty<BR>is surmounted if the category
of contractual relationship in which the<BR>implication will arise is
defined with sufficient precision.&quot; (at p. 307)</FONT></SPAN></FONT></P>

<FONT SIZE=3><SPAN LANG="en-GB"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Lord Bridge
then proceeded to define the situation on the basis of
the<BR>relationship of employer and employee where the circumstances
he specified<BR>existed. As 1 understand the <I>Scally </I>case, it
recognises that, just as in the<BR>earlier authorities the courts
were prepared to imply by necessary implication<BR>.1 term imposing a
duty on an employer to exercise due care for the physical<BR>well
being of his employees, so in the appropriate circumstances would
the<BR>court imply a like duty as to his economic well being, the
duty as to his<BR>economic well being giving rise to an action for
