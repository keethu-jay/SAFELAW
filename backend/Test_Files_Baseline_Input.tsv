Tribunal Majority	Ann Kelly v Fergus Hennessy [1995] 3 IR 253.xml	Beginning	The plaintiff's husband and one of her daughters suffered permanent brain damage in a serious car-crash caused by the negligence of the defendant.	However, the plaintiff refused to take in trained help, as she believed it would prevent her from recovering from a condition she herself had developed as a result of the crash.	The plaintiff's claim was based on the psychiatric illness she suffered as a result of the accident. The defendant argued that her condition was attributable to the strain of caring for her family.
Tribunal Majority	Ann Kelly v Fergus Hennessy [1995] 3 IR 253.xml	Middle	Both the House of Lords and the High Court of Australia held that it was sufficient that the psychiatric illness which the plaintiffs suffered were as a result of what the plaintiffs saw or heard in the aftermath.	As Brennan J. stated, the shock must be such as to cause a recognizable psychiatric illness. This requirement is necessary to limit the potential liability of a negligent defendant.	The court must determine if the plaintiff's illness was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's negligence involving an assessment of the proximity of the plaintiff to the accident.
Tribunal Majority	Ann Kelly v Fergus Hennessy [1995] 3 IR 253.xml	End	The fact that the plaintiff may never fully recover implies that she may partially recover.	A psychiatric illness from which there is partial recovery remains a serious problem, and this fact was clearly taken into consideration by the learned trial judge when he determined the quantum.	In these circumstances the sum is not excessive or so excessive as to warrant interference by this Court. The appeal is dismissed.
UKSC Majority	Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100.xml	Beginning	On August 26th, 1928, the Appellant drank a bottle of ginger beer, manufactured by the Respondent, which a friend had bought from a retailer and given to her.	The bottle contained the decomposed remains of a snail which were not and could not be detected until the greater part of the contents of the bottle had been consumed. As a result she alleged that she suffered from shock and severe gastro enteritis.	She accordingly instituted the proceedings against the manufacturers which have given rise to this appeal. The foundation of her case is that the Respondent, as the manufacturers, owed a duty to her as consumer.
UKSC Majority	Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100.xml	Middle	In Dixon v. Bell, the defendant had left a loaded gun at his lodgings and sent his servant to retrieve it. The landlord removed the priming, but the girl later injured the plaintiff's son.	Lord Ellenborough and Bayley J.J. remarked that it was incumbent on the defendant, who by charging the gun had made it capable of doing mischief, to render it safe and innoxious.	In Langridge v. Levy, the action was based on the defendant falsely and fraudulently warranting a gun to be safe. The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff.
UKSC Majority	Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100.xml	End	It may be a good general rule to regard responsibility as ceasing when control ceases.	But where the article of consumption is so prepared as to be intended to reach the consumer in the condition in which it leaves the manufacturer, I regard his control as remaining effective until the article reaches the consumer.	The burden of proof must always be upon the injured party to establish that the defect which caused the injury was present in the article when it left the hands of the party whom he sues.
Tribunal Majority	McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2.xml	Beginning	The plaintiff is a married woman who had been warned by her medical adviser that her life would be in danger if she were to become pregnant again.	Having considered this advice, she and her husband decided that they should have no more children and would resort to the use of contraceptives. Her doctor prescribed the use of a diaphragm together with a contraceptive jelly.	When she attempted to import a quantity of the jelly, it was seized by the customs authorities. They refused her application to release it based on Section 17 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act.
Tribunal Majority	McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2.xml	Middle	I wish to emphasise that I have given no consideration whatsoever to the question of the constitutionality of laws which would withhold or restrict the availability of contraceptives for use outside of marriage.	Nothing in this judgment is intended to offer any opinion on that matter. I would grant the plaintiff a declaration that sub-s. 3 of s. 17 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935 is not of full force and effect.	The Supreme Court must now consider if the guarantee of the State to respect the personal rights of citizens includes the right to family privacy in this context.
Tribunal Majority	McGee v A.G. and Anor [1973] IESC 2.xml	End	The literal translation makes it a guarantee -"not to interfere with" rather than a guarantee to "respect."	In my opinion, a statute which makes it a criminal offence for the plaintiff or her husband to import or to acquire possession of contraceptives for use within their marriage is an unjustifiable invasion of privacy.	In Griswold v. Connecticut, Douglas J. stated that the case concerns a relationship lying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.
UKSC Majority	McLoughlin v O'Brian [1982] UKHL 3.xml	Beginning	The plaintiff, who was at home two miles away at the time, was told of the accident at about 6 p.m. by a neighbour, who took her to hospital to see her family.	There she learned that her youngest daughter had been killed and saw her husband and the other children and witnessed the nature and extent of their injuries. She alleged that the impact of what she heard and saw caused her nervous shock.	The defendants admitted negligence in the road accident but denied that they owed a duty of care to the plaintiff because she was not present at the scene.
UKSC Majority	McLoughlin v O'Brian [1982] UKHL 3.xml	Middle	The court must consider whether the psychiatric illness suffered was a reasonably foreseeable result of the defendant's negligence.	It places their effects within the range of the natural and probable. The wrong that imperils life is a wrong to the imperilled victim; it is a wrong also to his rescuer.	This extension of the duty of care recognizes that those who suffer shock from witnessing the aftermath are within the area of potential danger.
UKSC Majority	McLoughlin v O'Brian [1982] UKHL 3.xml	End	The "floodgates" argument suggests that allowing such claims would lead to a proliferation of litigation.	I conclude that in this area of the law there are no policy considerations sufficient to justify limiting the liability of negligent tort-feasors by reference to some narrower criterion than that of reasonable foreseeability.	My Lords, I would accordingly allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the trial judge in favor of the plaintiff.
Tribunal Majority	Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3.xml	Beginning	The plaintiff seeks a declaration that sections 61 and 62 of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, are inconsistent with the Constitution.	These sections criminalize certain private homosexual acts between consenting adults. The plaintiff argues that this legislation violates his constitutional right to privacy and personal liberty.	His claim was rejected in the High Court, and he has now appealed to the Supreme Court. The court must decide if the state has the power to regulate such private conduct.
Tribunal Majority	Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3.xml	Middle	Professor Ivor Browne gave it as his considered opinion that the impugned statutory provisions exacerbate the fears and loneliness of homosexual men.	He stated that attempts to prohibit or divert the pursuit of their instinctive and inescapable sexual urges by means of legal constraints are undesirable and counterproductive.	His experience in England suggested that the relaxation of criminal restrictions did not cause a deterioration of general moral standards or an increase in the prevalence of homosexuality.
Tribunal Majority	Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3.xml	End	Apart from the limited issue of locus standi, my judgment depends upon the right of privacy derived from Article 40.	It may be that the criminalisation of the sexual acts proscribed by the impugned sections is contrary to the law of God; I am content to hold that it is contrary to one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.	Public order and morality require that homosexual acts be made criminal in many circumstances, such as for the protection of the young or the maintenance of marriage.
