Before addressing the evidence on the nature and extent of RS’ activities, it is important to establish her mental health circumstances. There is no dispute as to the medical evidence provided by, in particular, Dr Brady. In light of this, we accept her diagnoses and find that RS is currently suffering from the following conditions: i. severe PTSD; ii. severe depression; iii. schizoaffective disorder, currently in partial remission.","KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT","64. The medical evidence before the present tribunal included a Med 3 of 12 September 2018 referring to anxiety and depression, a Med 3 and referral in December referring to PTSD in relation to earlier traumatic events of a sexual nature, and an assessment report of March 2019 referring to her presentation as “anxiety and depression linked with PTSD symptoms”. Ms B also produced to the tribunal a letter from her GP saying that there were no entries in her records relating to mental ill health, including depression, anxiety or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder prior to September 2018.","A  Anor v C Limited  Ors","(e) The appellant’s mother also receives medication for depression as well as hypertension and was noted to have suffered a stroke.","Alban Velaj v The Secretary of State for the Home Department","14. In her judgment ( [2017] EWHC 2990 (QB) ; [2018] 4 WLR 8), Yip J described the legal issue which she had to address in these terms (para 2): “Can a mother who consults a doctor with a view to avoiding the birth of a child with a particular disability (rather than to avoid the birth of any child) recover damages for the additional costs associated with an unrelated disability?” She answered that question in the affirmative and awarded the appellant £9m inclusive of interest. Much of the debate before Yip J concerned two judgments of the Court of Appeal: Parkinson v St James and Seacroft University Hospital NHS Trust [2001] EWCA Civ 530 ; [2002] QB 266 (“ Parkinson ”) and Groom v Selby [2001] EWCA Civ 1522 ; [2002] Lloyd’s Rep Med 1 (“ Groom ”). In the first case, Mrs Parkinson became pregnant following a failed sterilisation. Her son was born with severe disabilities which were not connected to the sterilisation. In the second case, Mrs Groom underwent a sterilisation operation at a time when unknown to anyone she was about six days pregnant. Shortly afterwards, she consulted her general practitioner who failed to arrange a pregnancy test or examine her to see if she was pregnant. By the time she discovered her pregnancy, she did not wish to have a termination, but she would have terminated the pregnancy if informed sooner. She later gave birth to a child with salmonella meningitis resulting in severe disability. In each case, there was no direct connection between the negligence of the medical practitioner and the disability. In the first case the source of the child’s disability was genetic and in the second the disability arose from exposure to a bacterium during the process of her birth. In each case, the mother had not wanted to have any further children and she sought the services of the defendants for that purpose.","Khan v Meadows","623. We have taken RS’ mental health into account when evaluating her evidence.","KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT","83. Instead of obtaining e.g. a psychologist’s report, the Claimant sought to rely upon an article written by psychiatrists as to the pathological effects of significant humiliation upon a person’s mental health. For reasons already discussed under Ground 4, such generalised material is unlikely to be of assistance as it says nothing about the Claimant’s own state.","AB v CD Ltd","27. The judge then continued: “55. Thus, again doubt is cast as to the claimant’s account generally on matters. It was in the claimant’s interest to relay the existence of adverse effects to the providers of the medical reports in the context of his personal injury claim. 56. Dr Misra stated that she had no reason to doubt the claimant’s veracity and his account was consistent verbally and the symptoms and psychological problems were highly consistent and thus an honest report of his difficulties and there was no evidence of conscious exaggeration or other consistency factors [186 paragraph 13]. However, no GP or hospital records were provided to Dr Misra and the only other medical report she had was that of Dr Whittington [185 Section E]. I should also record that Dr Misra’s assessment was undertaken by videoconference. She thus did not have the other reports and claimant’s impact statements, nor has she heard the claimant’s account before me. 57. For the reasons I give above there are inconsistencies in those accounts and I also note Dr Misra acknowledged (see (41)) an ‘unconscious magnification of symptoms’ by the claimant. 58. That consistency and credibility point is reinforced by another issue the respondent refers me to, namely that one of Case Number: 1306691/2019 - 15 - the principal adverse effects the claimant gives concerning his mental health impairments was the effect that has had on him socialising. In contrast Dr Misra indicated there was no significant disruption to the claimant’s life and socialisation was not affected [181 - 5.4.3]. 59. Those matters collectively call into question the account the claimant has given to different practitioners and the Tribunal over time, concerning matters that go to the core of his complaints here, whether there was a substantial adverse effect on his ability to undertake day to day activities. 60. They spread across the depth and breadth of his account and combined with the credibility points I refer to above lead me to conclude notwithstanding the assessment Dr Misra made as to the veracity of the claimant’s account (see (56)) that I should place no weight on the claimant’s account (unless supported elsewhere) and that includes that given to the various practitioners and thus the conclusions they reach as a result.”","A Rehman v DHL Services Limited","85. It is admitted that Dr Khan incorrectly and negligently advised Ms Meadows that she was not a carrier of a haemophilia gene, when in fact she was. As a result of this negligent advice, the claimant later conceived and gave birth to a son, A, who suffers from haemophilia. Had appropriate tests been arranged and the claimant been told, as she should have been, that she was carrying a haemophilia gene, she would have undergone foetal testing during her pregnancy and would have terminated her pregnancy when she found out that she would otherwise give birth to a child with haemophilia.","Khan v Meadows","35. As Lord Sumption has recently explained in Hughes-Holland , this principle was developed by the House of Lords in a series of cases concerning the negligent valuation of property following the property crash in the early 1990s: SAAMCO , Nykredit Mortgage Bank plc v Edward Erdman Group Ltd (formerly Edward Erdman (an unlimited company) (No 2) [1997] 1 WLR 1627 (“ Nykredit ”) and Platform Home Loans Ltd v Oyston Shipways Ltd [2000] 2 AC 190 (“ Platform Home Loans ”).

"UKSC","Majority","Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100.xml","Middle","In Dixon v. Bell , 1816 5 M. & S. 198, the defendant had left a loaded gun at his lodgings and sent his servant, a mulatto girl aged about 13 or 14, for the gun, asking the landlord to remove the priming and give it her. The landlord did remove the priming and gave it to the girl, who later levelled it at the plaintiff's small son, drew the trigger and injured the boy. The action was in case for negligently entrusting the young servant with the gun. The jury at the trial before Lord Ellenborough had returned a verdict for the plaintiff. A motion by Sir William Garrow, Attorney-General, for a new trial was dismissed by the Court. Lord Ellenborough and Bayley J.J., the former remarking that it was incumbent on the defendant, who by charging the gun had made it capable of doing mischief, to render it safe and innoxious.","In, Langridge v. Levy (1837) 2 M. & W. 519 (1838) 4 M. & W. 337 the action was in case and the declaration alleged that the defendant by falsely and fraudulently warranting a gun to have been made by Nock and to be a good, safe and secure gun, sold the gun to the plaintiff's father for the use of himself and his son, and that one of his sons confiding in the warranty used the gun, which burst and injured him. Plea not guilty and no warranty as alleged. The report is not very satisfactory. No evidence is reported of any warranty or statement except that the gun was an elegant twist gun by Nock. The judge left to the jury whether the defendant had warranted the gun to be by Nock and to be safe: whether it was in fact unsafe: and whether the defendant warranted it to be safe knowing that it was not so. The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff. It appears to have been argued that the plaintiff could recover wherever there is a breach of duty imposed on the defendant by contract or otherwise, and the plaintiff is injured by reason of its breach: by this is meant apparently that the duty need not be owed to the plaintiff but that he can take advantage of the breach of a duty owed to a third party. This contention was negatived by the Court, who held, however, that the plaintiff could recover if a representation known to be false was made to a third person with the intention that a chattel should be used by the plaintiff, even though it does not appear that the defendant intended the false representation to be communicated to him. See per Parke B. 2 M. & W. at p. 531. The same view was adopted by the Exchequer Chamber, the user by the plaintiff being treated by the Court as one of the acts contemplated by the fraudulent defendant. It is unnecessary to consider whether the proposition can be supported in its widest form. It is sufficient to say that the case was based as I think in the pleading and certainly in the judgment on the ground of fraud, and it appears to add nothing of value positively or negatively to the present discussion. Winterbottom v. Wright 1842 10 M. & W. 109 was a case decided on a demurrer. The plaintiff had demurred to two of the pleas as to which there was no decision by the Court, but on the hearing of the plaintiff's demurrer the Court in accordance with the practice of the day were entitled to consider the whole record including the declaration, and coming to the conclusion that the declaration disclosed no cause of action, gave judgment for the defendant - See Sutton's ""Personal Actions at Common Law"" page 113. The advantage of the procedure is that we are in a position to know the precise issue at law which arose for determination. The declaration was in case and alleged that the defendant had contracted with the Postmaster-General to provide the mail coach to convey mails from Hartford to Holyhead and to keep the mails in safe condition, that Atkinson and others with notice of the said contract bad contracted with the Postmaster-General to convey the road mailcoach from Hartford to Holyhead : and that the plaintiff relying on the said first contract hired himself to Atkinson to drive the mailcoach, but that the defendant so negligently conducted himself and so utterly disregarded his aforesaid contract that the defendant having the means of knowing and well knowing all the aforesaid premises, the mailcoach being in a dangerous condition owing to certain latent defects and to no other cause gave way, whereby the plaintiff was thrown from his seat and injured. It is to be observed that no negligence apart from breach of contract was alleged, in other words no duty was alleged other than the duty arising out of the contract : it is not stated that the defendant knew or ought to have known of the latent defect. The argument of the defendant was that on the face of the declaration the wrong arose merely out of the breach of a contract, and that only a party to the contract could sue. The Court of Exchequer adopted that view, as clearly appears from the judgments of Alderson and Rolfe B.B. There are dicta by Lord Abinger which are too wide as to an action of negligence being confined to cases of breach of a public duty. The actual decision appears to have been manifestly right; no duty to the plaintiff arose out of the contract; and the duty of the defendant under the contract with the Postmaster General to put the coach in good repair could not have involved those direct relations with the servant of the persons whom the Postmaster-General employed to drive the coach as would give rise to a duty of care owed to such servant. We now come to Langmeid v. Holliday","(1851) 6 Ex. 761, the dicta in which have had considerable effect in subsequent decisions. In that case the declaration in case alleged that the plaintiff, Frederick Langmeid, had bought from the defendant, the maker and seller of "" the Holliday lamp,"" a lamp to be used by himself and his wife Eliza in the plaintiff's shop; that the defendant induced the sale by the false and fraudulent warranty that the lamp was reasonably fit for the purpose; and that the plaintiff Eliza, confiding in the said warranty, lighted the lamp which exploded whereby she was injured.

Levy .","0.5889","0.3603","0.5889, 0.5210, 0.5074, 0.4985, 0.4984, 0.4579, 0.4487, 0.4454, 0.4393, 0.4381","14. Holt CJ did not confine this principle to cases of negligence.

The 17th century was a century of expansion of commerce and industry, and vicarious liability began to be broadened. Holt CJ was particularly influential in this development. In Boson v Sandford (1691) 2 Salk 440 a shipper of goods sued the ship owner for damage caused by the negligence of the master. Eyre J held that there was no difference between a land carrier and a water carrier, and therefore the owners were under a special liability as carriers for the acts of their servants; but Holt CJ rested his judgment on the broad principle that “whoever employs another is answerable for him, and undertakes for his care to all that make use of him”. (The action failed on a technical pleading point.)","A M Mohamud in substitution for Mr A Mohamud deceased v WM Morrison Supermarkets plc","30. Liability in tort normally depends on the breach of a duty owed by the defendant to the claimant. The only true exception to that principle under the common law is vicarious liability, where for reasons of policy the defendant is held liable for the breach of a duty owed to the claimant by a third party. There cannot, however, be any rationale for imposing vicarious liability on a defendant where he is directly liable for the harm caused by the third party. It therefore makes sense to consider the scope of the defendant’s own duties before considering whether vicarious liability may exist.","Armes v Nottinghamshire County Council","33. Following the decision of the House of Lords in Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465 , the Scottish courts accepted the general principle that damages could be recovered for economic loss suffered as a result of reliance upon a negligent misrepresentation, where the relationship between the person making the representation and the person relying upon it was of a kind which gave rise to a duty of care. The salient feature of that case, and of later analogous cases such as Smith v Eric S Bush [1990] 1 AC 831 , which gave rise to such a duty, was identified by Lord Bridge of Harwich in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605 , 620-621:","Cramaso LLP v OgilvieGrant Earl of Seafield and Others","20. Passages can be found in authority where courts have used language suggesting that, for a duty of care to arise in tort in respect of a representation, (a) not only must the claimant be a specific person or within a group to whom responsibility may be said to have been undertaken, but (b) the purpose for which the representation is required must be “specifically in connection with a particular transaction or transactions of a particular kind” or must, “whether particularly specified or generally described”, be “made known, either actually or inferentially”, to the representor: see eg per Lord Bridge and Lord Oliver in Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605 , 620-621 and 638, cited by Lord Sumption in his paras 8 and 9.","Banca Nazionale del Lavoro SPA v Playboy Club London Limited and others","47. In Colley v Overseas Exporters , cited above, McCardie J undertook a detailed examination of the pre-1893 Sale of Goods Act position at common law, concluding that there had been only two established counts available for recovery of the price of goods sold, both dependant on property passing and so falling within what became section 49(1) . Section 49(2) was a limited exception. Support for this can be found in the illuminating discussion and judgments in Laird v Pim (1841) 7 M & W 474, to which McCardie J also referred. In that case, the defendant, having contracted to purchase and having been given possession of a plot of land, had refused to complete a conveyance or pay for it. During the proceedings, the analogy with the non-acceptance of goods was drawn, and at one point Parke B pointed out that, since the land was still the plaintiff’s at law, the plaintiff might bring ejectment. The plaintiff made clear however that it was not claiming the price of the whole purchase money, but “only for the damages sustained by the non-performance of the contract” (p 479). To this counsel for the defendant responded (p 483) that “Unless the defendants are bound to pay the purchase-money, no damages can be recovered for the non-payment of it: the plaintiff, therefore, must shew not only that the defendants did not pay, but also that they were bound to pay”. But this argument failed. Parke B said (p 485) that the plaintiff was","PST Energy 7 Shipping LLC and another v O W Bunker Malta Limited and another","80. The scope of the duty of a valuer can likewise, as Lord Hoffmann indicated (at p 212D-G), be identified by analysing the purpose of the service which the valuer undertakes to provide. From the known purpose of a valuation, Lord Hoffmann deduced that a valuer who enters into a contract to provide a valuation owes a duty of care. As for the scope of the duty, “in the sense of the consequences for which the valuer is responsible” (p 212E), he observed that there is no reason in principle why the law should not penalise wrongful conduct by shifting onto the wrongdoer the whole risk of consequences which would not have happened but for the wrongful act. Normally, however, the law does not “make the wrongdoer liable for all the consequences of his wrongful conduct” but “limits liability to those consequences which are attributable to that which made the act wrongful” (see p 213C). Lord Hoffmann illustrated this point by reference to a case discussed by Hart and Honoré in their classic work on Causation in the Law , 2nd ed (1985), pp 118-120: The Empire Jamaica [1955] P 52 ; affirmed [1955] P 259 (CA); [1957] AC 386 (HL). In that case a collision at sea was caused by the negligence of a ship’s mate who lacked a certificate of competence required by the Merchant Shipping Acts. In proceedings to limit the liability of the vessel’s owners for damage caused by the collision, it was held that the owners had succeeded in proving that the damage occurred without their “actual fault or privity” despite their failure to employ a certificated mate. This was because, on the evidence, the owners had good reason to consider the mate to be competent and there was no causal connection between the lack of a certificate (in respect of which the owners were at fault) and the damage which occurred.","Manchester Building Society v Grant Thornton UK LLP","43. As I have explained, however, that does not mean that liability will necessarily exist where a party to a contract has been induced to enter into it by a negligent misrepresentation made by or on behalf of another party to the contract. Since section 10(1) does not create a statutory liability, the question whether the misrepresentation was made in breach of a duty of care still has to be answered, even if the answer may sometimes be obvious.","Cramaso LLP v OgilvieGrant Earl of Seafield and Others","36. Section 10(1) is drafted in a negative form. It does not provide that a party to a contract who has been induced to enter into it by negligent misrepresentation made by or on behalf of another party to the contract is entitled to recover damages: it provides that such a person shall not be disentitled by reason only that the misrepresentation is not fraudulent, and that any rule of law that such damages cannot be recovered unless fraud is proved shall cease to have effect. Whether such a person is entitled to damages therefore depends on the common law, modified by section 10(1) only to the extent that recovery is not excluded by reason of the absence of fraud. The consequence is that entitlement to damages depends upon establishing the breach of a duty of care, since at common law it is the breach of a duty of care which renders a negligent misrepresentation wrongful.","Cramaso LLP v OgilvieGrant Earl of Seafield and Others","15.

However, the general duty to make reasonable adjustments, imposed upon the providers of services by section 21 of the 1995 Act , did not apply to “any service so far as it consists of the use of any means of transport” ( section 19(5) (b)). Instead, Part V of the Act dealt with public transport and empowered the Secretary of State to make regulations “for the purpose of securing that it is possible for disabled persons - (a) to get on to and off regulated public service vehicles in safety and without unreasonable difficulty (and, in the case of disabled persons in wheelchairs, to do so while remaining in their wheelchairs); and (b) to be carried in such vehicles in safety and in reasonable comfort” ( section 40(1) ; now replaced by the Equality Act 2010 , section 174 ). It was pursuant to that and related powers that the Secretary of State made the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000, which are still in force. These impose detailed and technical requirements for the provision of access to, and wheelchair spaces and priority seating in, buses and coaches. This was a big advance, making public transport much more accessible than it had been before.","FirstGroup Plc v Paulley","30. The exact circumstances in which a restitutionary proprietary claim may exist is a controversial question which has given rise to a considerable body of judicial comment and academic literature. For present purposes it is enough to point out that where money is paid with the intention of transferring the entire beneficial interest to the payee, the least that must be shown in order to establish a constructive trust is (i) that that intention was vitiated, for example because the money was paid as a result of a fundamental mistake or pursuant to a contract which has been rescinded, or (ii) that irrespective of the intentions of the payer, in the eyes of equity the money has come into the wrong hands, as where it represents the fruits of a fraud, theft or breach of trust or fiduciary duty against a third party. One or other of these is a necessary condition, although it may not be a sufficient one. Neither of them was satisfied in Neste Oy . In particular, the prospect of a total failure of consideration, however inevitable, is not a circumstance which could have vitiated the intention of the shipowner to part with its entire interest in the money. The right to the restitution of money paid on a consideration which has wholly failed is simply a process of contractual readjustment, giving rise like the contract itself to purely personal obligations. If an actual total failure of consideration does not give rise to a proprietary restitutionary right, I do not see how a prospective one can do so.","Bailey and another v Angoves PTY Limited","195. The principle stated in the first sentence is illustrated in domestic law by West Rand Central Gold Mining Co v The King [1905] 2 KB 391 , in which the King’s Bench Divisional Court held that there was no principle of international law by which, after annexation or conquest, a conquering state could become liable, absent express contrary stipulation, to discharge the financial liabilities of the conquered state incurred before the outbreak of war.","Keyu and others v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and another","55. Finally, the case illustrates that it may be unwise to be too prescriptive about the order which the court should make to redress such advantage or disadvantage. In principle, if one party has derived a clear and quantifiable economic benefit from the economic contributions of the other, it may be fair to order what is, in effect, restitution of the value of that benefit. But sometimes the benefit will result from non-financial contributions or be very hard to quantify. Even more problematic are the cases where there is identifiable economic disadvantage, as here, without a corresponding economic advantage. In some cases, it may be entirely fair to expect the better-off partner to compensate the other in full for the losses she has sustained as a result of their relationship: as, for example, where a rich widower persuades a widow to give up her secure tenancy and widow’s pension to move in with him and can well afford to put her back in the position in which she was before their cohabitation began. In others, this may be impossible or quite unfair. Thus, it seems to me, the flexibility inherent in the Scottish provisions is preferable to the Law Commission’s proposal that the losses should be shared between them. On the other hand, the Law Commission’s proposed list of factors to be taken into account in the exercise of the court’s discretion might be a useful addition to the Scottish law, as also might the power to make a periodical payments order in those rare cases where it is not practicable to make an order that a capital sum be paid by instalments.","Gow v Grant Scotland","21. If the English court must apply its own rules of assessment, then what rules are these, if not those of the Fatal Accidents Act? I do not think that it is necessary to resort to analogies, because English law does provide a remedy that harmonises with the German law right, namely damages. Mr Kretschmer committed a tort under German law, and thereby incurred a substantive liability to pay financial compensation. The principal head of loss for which he was liable to compensate Major Cox’s widow was the deprivation of the net financial benefit to her of her legal right to maintenance from him. This is entirely cognate with the corresponding remedy in English law. It is true, as the Court of Appeal pointed out, that because the cause of action in English law for a fatal accident is an action under section 1 of the Act , there is no non-statutory measure of damages for fatal accidents. But this does not matter. If, as I consider, the particular rules of assessment in the Fatal Accidents Act do not apply as a matter of construction of the Act , then the answer must be sought in the rules of assessment which apply generally in English law in the absence of any statute displacing them. The relevant English law principle of assessment, which applies in the absence of any statute to the contrary, is that Mrs Cox must be put in the same financial position, neither better nor worse, as she would have been in if her husband had not been fatally injured. It follows that even if one assumes, for the sake of argument, that the Court of Appeal were right to regard the damages rules of the Act as procedural, in principle credit must be given for maintenance from her subsequent partner during the period since the birth of their child. This is because damages at common law are assessed on the footing that credit must be given for receipts referable to the original loss, with very limited exceptions such as insurance receipts which are not relevant in this case.","Cox v Ergo Versicherung AG","33. In that context what section 28 seeks to achieve is fairness in the assessment of compensation for contributions made or economic disadvantages suffered in the interests of the relationship. The wording of subsections (3), (5) and (6) should be read broadly rather than narrowly, bearing in mind the point that the Scottish Law Commission made in para 16.18 that the principle in section 9(1) (b) of the 1985 Act which these subsections adopt was designed to correct imbalances arising out of a non-commercial relationship where parties are quite likely to make contributions or sacrifices without counting the cost or bargaining for a return. As Lady Hale points out (see para 54, below), in most cases it is quite impracticable to work out who has paid for what and who has enjoyed what benefits in kind during the cohabitation, as people do not keep such running accounts and the cost of working things out in detail is quite disproportionate to the task of doing justice between the parties.","Gow v Grant Scotland","20. Giving the leading speech with which the other Justices of the Supreme Court agreed, Lord Sumption JSC explained the principle of state immunity at paragraph 17 of Benkharbouche v Embassy of the Republic of Sudan [2017] UKSC 62 , [2019] AC 777 (“ Benkharbouche ”) as follows: “ State immunity is a mandatory rule of customary international law which defines the limits of a domestic court’s jurisdiction. Unlike diplomatic immunity, which the modern law treats as serving an essentially functional purpose, state immunity does not derive from the need to protect the integrity of a foreign state’s governmental functions or the proper conduct of inter-state relations. It derives from the sovereign equality of states. Par in parem non habet imperium. In the modern law the immunity does not extend to acts of a private law character. In respect of these, the state is subject to the territorial jurisdiction of the forum in the same way as any non-state party.”","A Muda v Malaysia","126.

Parties who make such agreements are not necessarily on an equal standing, above all emotionally. They may not have a full appreciation of such an agreement’s significance and likely impact. Above all, they may well not foresee, or cater adequately for, the way in which not only their relationship but their whole lives and individual circumstances may change, especially over time and very often as a direct or indirect result of their marriage.","Radmacher formerly Granatino v Granatino"

It is in the circumstances unnecessary to address the detailed submissions made by the parties on the admissibility of various exchanges which took place in Parliament during the passage of the 1981 Act as reported in Hansard.

It is not necessary or appropriate to go further into that issue in this case. The wider view of the word “landed” is, I consider, plainly correct. Suffice it to say, that, had it been appropriate to have regard to Hansard, the ministerial statements in response to specific questions in the course of the Bill’s passage through Parliament would in my view have confirmed very clearly that it was intended, by section 14(2), to maintain the pre-existing levying power in relation to imports generally.","Bloomsbury International Limited and others v Sea Fish Industry Authority and Department for Environ"

 though called contraceptives, as in the case of abortifacients entirely different considerations may arise. In 
my opinion, a statute which makes it a criminal offence for the plaintiff or her husband to import or to acquire possession of contraceptives for
 use within their marriage is an unjustifiable invasion of privacy in the conduct of the most intimate of all their personal relationships.","In Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) 381 U.S 479, 
which was another case dealing with the same Connecticut law, Douglas J. delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States; at p. 485 of the report he said: _
 ""The present case, then, concerns a relationship lying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees. And it concerns a law which, in forbidding the use 
of contraceptives rather than regulating their manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship. Such a law cannot stand in light of the familiar pr
inciple, so often applied by this Court, that a 
governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms NAACP v. Alabama. 
 Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship. We deal with a 
right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights-older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a 
coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that 
promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects.""","","0.4227","0.4235","0.4227, 0.4072, 0.3940, 0.3790, 0.3778, 0.3736, 0.3707, 0.3693, 0.3612, 0.3530","(4) Even if it were legitimate to impose the marriage condition for the purpose of protecting the status of marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman, that could not justify imposing the same condition on eligibility for a state retirement pension, to which marital status is likewise irrelevant.

This question was not addressed in the Court of Appeal, as they had concluded that this was direct discrimination. It was addressed by the judge, who confessed that he did not find regulation 3(3)(d) easy to interpret. Worded as it is, I understand what he means. Mr and Mrs Bull seek to justify their policy by reference to a deeply held belief that sexual intercourse outside marriage is sinful. Can that belief be a “matter other than [their] sexual orientation”? I am prepared to accept that it can, not least because it covers all kinds of unmarried couple. But it would be hard to find that a belief that sexual intercourse between civil partners was sinful was a “matter other than [their] sexual orientation”, because by definition such sexual intercourse has to be between persons of the same sex.","Bull and another v Hall and another","25. Does it make a difference that this couple were in a civil partnership? In my view, it does. The concept of marriage being applied by Mr and Mrs Bull was the Christian concept of the union of one man and one woman. That is clear from the reference to “heterosexual married couples” in the statement of policy which was current at the time; it is even clearer from the amended policy, which read “… out of a deep regard for marriage (being the union of one man to one woman for life to the exclusion of all others) …”; and was made clear to the couple by what Mr Quinn said when Mr Preddy told him that they were civil partners.","Bull and another v Hall and another","34. Mr and Mrs Bull argue that they should not be compelled to run their business in a way which conflicts with their deeply held religious beliefs. They should not be obliged to facilitate what they regard as sin by allowing unmarried couples to share a bed. A fair balance should be struck between their right to manifest their faith and the right of Mr Preddy and Mr Bull to obtain goods, facilities and services without discrimination on grounds of their sexual orientation.","Bull and another v Hall and another","162. Once again, I adhere to the view expressed in MacLeod , that there may be important policy considerations justifying a different approach as between agreements made before and after a marriage. This is recognised in those jurisdictions which have legislated to make ante-nuptial agreements enforceable. It is, for example, common for them to contain safeguards which do not apply to agreements made after the marriage. Most important is whether, and if so in what circumstances, couples should be allowed to contract out of the fundamental obligations of the married state which they are about to enter.","Radmacher formerly Granatino v Granatino","1. Is it lawful for a Christian hotel keeper, who sincerely believes that sexual relations outside marriage are sinful, to refuse a double-bedded room to a same sex couple? Does it make any difference that the couple have entered into a civil partnership? These are questions which would have been unthinkable less than two decades ago. That they can now be asked is a measure of how far we have come in the recognition of same sex relationships since the repeal of section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 , in Scotland in 2000 and in England and Wales in 2003.","Bull and another v Hall and another","8. At the time that the Gender Recognition Act was passed a valid marriage could subsist in law only between a man and a woman. This had always been the law, but had been confirmed by the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 , section 11 (c). For this reason, the 2004 Act made special provision for married applicants, whose change of legally recognised gender would otherwise have resulted in their being married to a person of the same gender as themselves. This will be referred to below as the “marriage condition”. By section 4(2) an unmarried applicant who satisfied the criteria for gender recognition in sections 2 and 3 was entitled to a full gender recognition certificate, whereas by section 4(3) a married applicant who satisfied the same criteria was entitled only to an interim gender recognition certificate.","MB v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions","38. Leaving aside the usual contractual reasons, such as misrepresentation or undue influence, the only other such reason might be the old rule that agreements providing for a future separation are contrary to public policy. But the reasons given for that rule were founded on the enforceable duty of husband and wife to live together. This meant that there should be no inducement to either of them to live apart: see, for example, H v W 3 K & J 382, 386. There is no longer an enforceable duty upon husband and wife to live together. The husband’s right to use self-help to keep his wife at home has gone. He can now be guilty of the offences of kidnapping and false imprisonment if he tries to do so: see R v Reid [1973] QB 299 . The decree of restitution of conjugal rights, disobedience to which did for a while involve penal sanctions, has not since the abolition of those sanctions been used to force the couple to live together: see Nanda v Nanda [1968] P 351 . It was abolished by the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970 , at the same time as the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1970 abolished all the common law actions against third parties who interfered between husband and wife.","Radmacher formerly Granatino v Granatino","336. It is difficult to envisage a more controversial issue than the proper limits of the law governing abortion. Diametrically opposed views, and every shade of opinion in between, are held with equal sincerity and conviction. Each side of the debate appeals to moral or religious values which are held with passionate intensity. In a democracy on the British model, the natural place for that debate to be resolved is in the legislature.","In the matter of an application by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for Judicial Review","31. It used to be contrary to public policy for a married couple who were living together, or a couple about to get married, to make an agreement that provided for the contingency that they might separate. Marriage involved a duty to live together and an agreement making provision for the possibility of separation might act as an encouragement to separate. Such agreements were void and the court would pay no regard to them: Cocksedge v Cocksedge (1844) 14 Sim 244; 13 LJ Ch 384; H v W (1857) 3 K & J 382. The same was not true of an agreement to separate or an agreement that governed a separation that had already taken place. Lord Atkin in Hyman v Hyman [1929] AC 601 at p 625-626 gave a short history of such contracts and commented on their effect: “We have to deal with a separation deed, a class of document which has had a chequered career at law. Not recognized by the Ecclesiastical Courts, such contracts were enforced by the common law. Equity at first frowned. Lord Eldon doubted but enforced them: cf. St. John v. St. John (1803) Ves. 525, 529 and Bateman v. Countess of Ross (1813) 1 Dow 235; and see the arguments of Sir Fitzroy Kelly and Mr Turner and of Mr Bethell in Wilson v. Wilson (1848) 1 H. L. C. 538, 550-553, 564, 565. Finally they were fully recognized in equity by Lord Westbury’s leading judgment in Hunt v. Hunt (1861) 4 D. F. & J. 221, in which he followed Lord Cottenham’s decision in Wilson v. Wilson 1 H. L. C. 538, 550-553, 564, 565, where his argument for the respondent had prevailed. Full effect has therefore to be given in all courts to these contracts as to all other contracts. It seems not out of place to make this obvious reflection, for a perusal of some of the cases in the matrimonial courts seems to suggest that at times they are still looked at askance and enforced grudgingly. But there is no caste in contracts. Agreements for separation are formed, construed and dissolved and to be enforced on precisely the same principles as any respectable commercial agreement, of whose nature indeed they sometimes partake. As in other contracts stipulations will not be enforced which are illegal either as being opposed to positive law or public policy. But this is a common attribute of all contracts, though we may recognize that the subject-matter of separation agreements may bring them more than others into relation with questions of public policy.”","Radmacher formerly Granatino v Granatino"

As we have seen, the House of Lords held that, notwithstanding the allegation that the instrument was contrary to the laws of Hanover and Brunswick, “still if it is a sovereign act, then whether it be according to law or not according to law, we cannot inquire into it” ((1848) 2 HL Cas 1, per Lord Cottenham LC at p 21).","Maduro Board of the Central Bank of Venezuela v Guaidó Board of the Central Bank of Venezuela","8. In order to address the facts of this particular case it will be necessary, in due course, to set these out in a little detail.

In Murray v Bush (1873) LR 6 HL 37, the first of three decisions of the House of Lords dealing with de facto directors, the question concerned the validity of a share transfer and whether the purported transferee was a contributory. Its articles of association required (inter alia) that the directors at a board meeting had to certify their approval of the proposed transferee. Bush was a shareholder and a director. The articles also required directors to have a share qualification. The transfer was approved at a board meeting, but it was claimed that three of the directors were not duly appointed because they had not executed a deed binding themselves to obey the regulations of the company. The Joint Stock Companies Act 1844, section 30, provided that notwithstanding that it might be afterwards discovered that there was some defect or error in the appointment of the directors, any acts of those directors were to be valid. The House of Lords was equally divided on the outcome of the appeal (which was from a decision of Lord Hatherley LC , who also sat on the appeal) and therefore the appeal was dismissed. Lord Cairns and Lord Hatherley decided that the transfer was to be treated as valid because of section 30 and because the company itself had approved the transfer. Lord Hatherley (at pp 76-77) referred to directors to whom section 30 applied as directors de facto. This case concerned persons who acted in all respects as if they were directors.","Holland v The Commissioners for Her Majestys Revenue and Customs and another","153. As to the first strand, the respondents’ case is that, while the Scots Guards were on active service in Selangor, they were acting under the aegis of the constitutional arrangements in force in the Federation of Malaya or, alternatively, in the State of Selangor, and that any acts on their part were always attributable either to His Majesty in right of the Federation or to The Sultan as the Ruler of the State of Selangor, rather than to His Majesty in right of the United Kingdom. In drawing this distinction, the respondents rely on R (Quark Fishing Ltd) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [2005] UKHL 57 ; [2006] 1 AC 529 .","Keyu and others v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and another","66. This principle had its origin, as appears clearly from the decision of the lower court in that case, in the decision of the House of Lords in Duke of Brunswick v Duke of Hanover (1848) 2 HLC I, 17, in which it was said: “the courts of this country cannot sit in judgment upon an act of a sovereign, effected by virtue of his sovereign authority abroad …”: see Underhill v Hernandez , 65 F 577 (2d Cir 1895). As re-stated by the United States Supreme Court, the act of state doctrine was re-imported into English law in Luther v Sagor [1921] 3 KB 532 (CA).","Lucasfilm Limited and others v Ainsworth and another","59. Mr and Mrs John Mander were the shareholders of John Mander Ltd. They were also its directors. On 24 September 1987 they created the John Mander Ltd Directors Pension Scheme (“the JM Scheme”). They were the beneficiaries of the JM Scheme and they and a Mr Alexander Jackson, who was the Revenue-approved pensioneer trustee, were its original trustees. On 9 September 1994 Mr Jackson resigned as a trustee of the JM Scheme and DJT Trustees Ltd (“DJT”) were appointed in his place.","John Mander Pension Trustees Limited v Commissioners for Her Majestys Revenue and Customs","178. Against this background, I consider the two strands of the respondents’ submissions which I have summarised above.

The respondents acknowledged in their skeleton argument before the Court of Appeal that the Scots Guards were deployed to the Far East in right of the United Kingdom, but they submitted then, and they repeat the submission now, that what matters is the legal regime under which the Scots Guards acted while in Malaya (para 33).","Keyu and others v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and another"

The only justification for interpreting “safe” in section 29(1) as not importing the concept of reasonable foreseeability is that it is unnecessary to do so because reasonable foreseeability is imported into the reasonable practicability qualification.

With regard to the first three issues – and, indeed, the entire framework of this appeal, both factual and legal – I really cannot hope to improve upon Rix LJ’s judgment below. I could, of course, lengthen it: one can always do that. But I prefer instead to refer any interested reader to it and to confine myself to a substantially shorter summary of the reasons why for my part I agree with its conclusions. I cannot, however, escape a brief recitation of the main legal provisions governing care arrangements. I shall start with section 47 of the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 (“ NHSCCA 1990 ”) since it is common ground here that (i) the appellant is “substantially and permanently handicapped” within the meaning of section 29(1) of the National Assistance Act 1948 (“ NAA 1948 ”), (ii) the respondents are required under that section to make arrangements for promoting her welfare, (iii) the respondents are satisfied that it is necessary in order to meet the appellant’s needs to make arrangements for “the provision of practical assistance” for her in her own home within the meaning of section 2(1) (a) of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 (“ CSDPA 1970 ”), and (iv) the respondents are accordingly pursuant to that section under a duty to make those arrangements, acting under the Secretary of State’s general guidance issued pursuant to section 7(1) of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970 (“ LASSA 1970 ”).","R on the application of McDonald v Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea","8. Lord Campbell’s Act contained no provisions relating to damages, but over the years such provisions have been added in the course of successive amendments and re-enactments.

They provide:","Cox v Ergo Versicherung AG","173. For the reasons set out above, we would dismiss this appeal.","Lipton and another v BA Cityflyer Ltd","62. How then is the court to “distinguish between the deserving and the undeserving”? It might be thought, for example, that in the case of a large estate consisting mostly of inherited property, the children ought to inherit even if they are not in need. But that would run counter to the restriction of their claims to reasonable maintenance. It would also run counter to the approach long taken in the law of inter vivos financial provision for adult children. Thus in Lord Lilford v Glynn [1979] 1 WLR 78 , the judge had ordered a father, in addition to making periodical payments and providing for his daughters’ education, to make an immediate settlement upon them of £25,000 (a not inconsiderable sum in those days). The Court of Appeal held that “a father - even the richest father - ought not to be regarded as under ‘financial obligations [or] responsibilities’ to provide funds for the purpose of such settlements as are envisaged in this case on children who are under no disability and whose maintenance and education is secure” (p 85). That, of course, was a value judgment which may or may not have been based on a view that such provision ought to be “earned”. But it could be justified under the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 , because it contains age limits on the provision which may be ordered for children unless they are disabled, with the obvious aim of seeing them into adulthood and beyond that only to the end of their education. The 1975 Act contains no such age or disability related limits. So once again we are driven to ask what makes an adult child deserving or undeserving of reasonable maintenance?","Ilott v The Blue Cross and others","142. It can immediately be seen that the situation of these claimants is relevantly very different from the situation of lone parents with children of school age.

The correctness of taking that starting point is reinforced by regulation 3(4).

It is important to notice also certain other funds or forms of assistance (besides the provision of accommodation) accepted to be legitimately available to “the parties” in satisfying the maintenance requirement.

Persecution for reasons of homosexuality was not perceived as a problem by the High Contracting Parties when the Convention was being drafted.

This was manifest nonsense, but at least it avoided the evil of persecution. More recently, fanned by misguided but vigorous religious doctrine, the situation has changed dramatically. The ultra-conservative interpretation of Islamic law that prevails in Iran is one example. The rampant homophobic teaching that right-wing evangelical Christian churches indulge in throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa is another.

There are some countries in which a gay couple who lived together quite openly, and made no attempt to conceal their affection, even in public places, would be ‘inviting persecution’ (an expression used in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Binbasi [1989] Imm AR 595, p 4). That is an unfortunate expression. Some people who risk martyrdom have complex motivation and appear to others to be stubborn and wrong-headed. (John Donne, who was born a Catholic and knew a lot about persecution from his own family’s experiences, wrote a prose work entitled Pseudo-Martyr, published in 1610, deploring the intransigence of some loyal Catholics.) But neither the most courageous nor the most timorous forfeit protection as asylum seekers if, in their different ways, they satisfy the test of a well-founded fear of persecution because of their sexuality.","HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action","92. The notion that a gay man could (and so, some might say, should) avoid trouble by adopting a “discreet” lifestyle (or leading an entirely celibate life) is not limited to the context of asylum law. It is the way in which hundreds of thousands of gay men lived in England before the enactment of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 . But it has assumed particular importance in asylum law since gays and lesbians have become generally recognised as a particular social group for Convention purposes. Jenni Millbank has described this development (which she terms ‘discretion reasoning’) in “From discretion to disbelief: recent trends in refugee determinations on the basis of sexual orientation in Australia and the United Kingdom” (2009) 13 IJHR 391, 393-394 (most references omitted): “At its baldest, discretion reasoning entailed a ‘reasonable expectation that persons should, to the extent that it is possible, co-operate in their own protection’, by exercising ‘self-restraint’ such as avoiding any behaviour that would identify them as gay; never telling anyone they were gay; only expressing their sexuality by having anonymous sex in public places; pretending that their partner is a ‘flatmate’; or indeed remaining celibate. This approach subverted the aim of the Refugees Convention – that the receiving state provide a surrogate for protection from the home state – by placing the responsibility of protection upon the applicant: it is he or she who must avoid harm. The discretion approach also varied the scope of protection afforded in relation to each of the five Convention grounds by, for example, protecting the right to be ‘openly’ religious but not to be openly gay or in an identifiable same-sex relationship. ... The idea of discretion reflects broader social norms concerning the ‘proper place’ of lesbian and gay sexuality, as something to be hidden and reluctantly tolerated, a purely private sexual behaviour rather than an important and integral aspect of identity, or as an apparent relationship status. The discretion approach explicitly posited the principle that human rights protection available to sexual orientation was limited to private consensual sex and did not extend to any other manifestation of sexual identity (which has been variously characterised as ‘flaunting’ ‘displaying’ and ‘advertising’ homosexuality as well as ‘inviting’ persecution). Thus for example in 2001 the Federal Court of Australia held that the Iranian Penal Code prohibiting homosexuality and imposing a death penalty did ‘place limits’ on the applicant’s behaviour; the applicant had to ‘avoid overt and public, or publicly provocative homosexual activity. But having to accept those limits did not amount to persecution’. ( Nezhadian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1415, para 12). On appeal, the full Federal Court endorsed the view that ‘public manifestation of homosexuality is not an essential part of being homosexual’ ( WABR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 124, para 23). The discretion approach thus has had wide-reaching ramifications in terms of framing the human rights of lesbians and gay men to family life, freedom of association and freedom of expression as necessarily lesser in scope than those held by heterosexual people.”","HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action","22. The submission that it is proper to examine the question whether it would be objectively reasonable for the applicant to be expected to tolerate some element of concealment – I would prefer not to use the word “discretion”, as this euphemistic expression does not tell the whole truth – when he is returned to the country of his nationality cannot be dismissed so easily. Behaviour which reveals one’s sexual orientation, whether one is gay or straight, varies from individual to individual. It occupies a wide spectrum, from people who are naturally reticent and have no particular desire to establish a sexual relationship with anybody to those who wish, for various reasons, to proclaim in public their sexual identity. Social and family disapproval of overt sexual behaviour of any kind, gay or straight, may weigh more heavily with some people than others. Concealment due to a well-founded fear of persecution is one thing. Concealment in reaction to family or social pressures is another. So one must ask why the applicant will conduct himself in this way. A carefully nuanced approach is called for, to separate out those who are truly in need of surrogate protection from those who are not.","HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action","76. The New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority observed in Re GJ [1998] (1995) INLR 387, 420 that “sexual orientation is either an innate or unchangeable characteristic or a characteristic so fundamental to identity or human dignity that it ought not be required to be changed” (emphasis in the original). So, starting from that position, the Convention offers protection to gay and lesbian people – and, I would add, bisexuals and everyone else on a broad spectrum of sexual behaviour - because they are entitled to have the same freedom from fear of persecution as their straight counterparts. No-one would proceed on the basis that a straight man or woman could find it reasonably tolerable to conceal his or her sexual identity indefinitely to avoid suffering persecution. Nor would anyone proceed on the basis that a man or woman could find it reasonably tolerable to conceal his or her race indefinitely to avoid suffering persecution. Such an assumption about gay men and lesbian women is equally unacceptable. Most significantly, it is unacceptable as being inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the Convention since it involves the applicant denying or hiding precisely the innate characteristic which forms the basis of his claim of persecution: Atta Fosu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2008 FC 1135, para 17, per Zinn J.","HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action","52. Sexual orientation is a core component of a person’s identity which requires fulfilment through relationships with others of the same orientation. As Justice Sachs of the South African Constitutional Court movingly put it in National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice , 1999 (1) SA 6, para 117: “While recognising the unique worth of each person, the Constitution does not presuppose that a holder of rights is an isolated, lonely and abstract figure possessing a disembodied and socially disconnected self. It acknowledges that people live in their bodies, their communities, their cultures, their places and their times. The expression of sexuality requires a partner, real or imagined.”","Bull and another v Hall and another","53. Heterosexuals have known this about themselves and been able to fulfil themselves in this way throughout history. Homosexuals have also known this about themselves but were long denied the possibility of fulfilling themselves through relationships with others. This was an affront to their dignity as human beings which our law has now (some would say belatedly) recognised. Homosexuals can enjoy the same freedom and the same relationships as any others. But we should not underestimate the continuing legacy of those centuries of discrimination, persecution even, which is still going on in many parts of the world. It is no doubt for that reason that Strasbourg requires “very weighty reasons” to justify discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. It is for that reason that we should be slow to accept that prohibiting hotel keepers from discriminating against homosexuals is a disproportionate limitation on their right to manifest their religion.","Bull and another v Hall and another","11. The group is defined by the immutable characteristic of its members’ sexual orientation or sexuality. This is a characteristic that may be revealed, to a greater or lesser degree, by the way the members of this group behave. In that sense, because it manifests itself in behaviour, it is less immediately visible than a person’s race. But, unlike a person’s religion or political opinion, it is incapable of being changed. To pretend that it does not exist, or that the behaviour by which it manifests itself can be suppressed, is to deny the members of this group their fundamental right to be what they are – of the right to do simple, everyday things with others of the same orientation such as living or spending time together or expressing their affection for each other in public.","HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action","14. The reference in the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 shows that counteracting discrimination was a fundamental purpose of the Convention. Article 2 states: “Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.” Lord Steyn emphasised this point in Islam v Secretary of State for the Home Department; R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal, Ex p Shah [1999] 2 AC 629, 639. He also drew attention to the first preamble to the Declaration, which proclaimed the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. No mention is made of sexual orientation in the preamble or any of its articles, nor is sexual orientation mentioned in article 1A(2) of the Convention. But coupled with an increasing recognition of the rights of gay people since the early 1960s has come an appreciation of the fundamental importance of their not being discriminated against in any respect that affects their core identity as homosexuals. They are as much entitled to freedom of association with others of the same sexual orientation, and to freedom of self-expression in matters that affect their sexuality, as people who are straight.","HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action","83. The Secretary of State should, of course, apply the same approach when considering applications of this type. Although I have, for the most part, concentrated on the position of gay men, the Secretary of State and tribunals should approach applications concerning lesbian women in the same way.","HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action"
