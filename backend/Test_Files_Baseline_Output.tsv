A woman approaches a general medical practice for testing to establish whether she is a carrier of a hereditary disease. Tests which are inappropriate to answer that question are arranged. A general medical practitioner when informing her of the results of those tests negligently fails to advise her that she needs a genetic test to establish whether she is a carrier of the relevant gene. In fact, she is a carrier of the disease. Several years later, she gives birth to a baby boy who sadly not only suffers from the hereditary disease but also has an unrelated disability. Is the medical practitioner liable in negligence for the costs of bringing up the disabled child who has both conditions or only for those costs which are associated with the hereditary disease?

Khan v Meadows	620. Before addressing the evidence on the nature and extent of RS’ activities, it is important to establish her mental health circumstances. There is no dispute as to the medical evidence provided by, in particular, Dr Brady. In light of this, we accept her diagnoses and find that RS is currently suffering from the following conditions: i. severe PTSD; ii. severe depression; iii. schizoaffective disorder, currently in partial remission.	KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT	64. The medical evidence before the present tribunal included a Med 3 of 12 September 2018 referring to anxiety and depression, a Med 3 and referral in December referring to PTSD in relation to earlier traumatic events of a sexual nature, and an assessment report of March 2019 referring to her presentation as “anxiety and depression linked with PTSD symptoms”. Ms B also produced to the tribunal a letter from her GP saying that there were no entries in her records relating to mental ill health, including depression, anxiety or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder prior to September 2018.	A  Anor v C Limited  Ors	(e) The appellant’s mother also receives medication for depression as well as hypertension and was noted to have suffered a stroke.	Alban Velaj v The Secretary of State for the Home Department	14. In her judgment ( [2017] EWHC 2990 (QB) ; [2018] 4 WLR 8), Yip J described the legal issue which she had to address in these terms (para 2): “Can a mother who consults a doctor with a view to avoiding the birth of a child with a particular disability (rather than to avoid the birth of any child) recover damages for the additional costs associated with an unrelated disability?” She answered that question in the affirmative and awarded the appellant £9m inclusive of interest. Much of the debate before Yip J concerned two judgments of the Court of Appeal: Parkinson v St James and Seacroft University Hospital NHS Trust [2001] EWCA Civ 530 ; [2002] QB 266 (“ Parkinson ”) and Groom v Selby [2001] EWCA Civ 1522 ; [2002] Lloyd’s Rep Med 1 (“ Groom ”). In the first case, Mrs Parkinson became pregnant following a failed sterilisation. Her son was born with severe disabilities which were not connected to the sterilisation. In the second case, Mrs Groom underwent a sterilisation operation at a time when unknown to anyone she was about six days pregnant. Shortly afterwards, she consulted her general practitioner who failed to arrange a pregnancy test or examine her to see if she was pregnant. By the time she discovered her pregnancy, she did not wish to have a termination, but she would have terminated the pregnancy if informed sooner. She later gave birth to a child with salmonella meningitis resulting in severe disability. In each case, there was no direct connection between the negligence of the medical practitioner and the disability. In the first case the source of the child’s disability was genetic and in the second the disability arose from exposure to a bacterium during the process of her birth. In each case, the mother had not wanted to have any further children and she sought the services of the defendants for that purpose.	Khan v Meadows	623. We have taken RS’ mental health into account when evaluating her evidence.	KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT	83. Instead of obtaining e.g. a psychologist’s report, the Claimant sought to rely upon an article written by psychiatrists as to the pathological effects of significant humiliation upon a person’s mental health. For reasons already discussed under Ground 4, such generalised material is unlikely to be of assistance as it says nothing about the Claimant’s own state.	AB v CD Ltd	27. The judge then continued: “55. Thus, again doubt is cast as to the claimant’s account generally on matters. It was in the claimant’s interest to relay the existence of adverse effects to the providers of the medical reports in the context of his personal injury claim. 56. Dr Misra stated that she had no reason to doubt the claimant’s veracity and his account was consistent verbally and the symptoms and psychological problems were highly consistent and thus an honest report of his difficulties and there was no evidence of conscious exaggeration or other consistency factors [186 paragraph 13]. However, no GP or hospital records were provided to Dr Misra and the only other medical report she had was that of Dr Whittington [185 Section E]. I should also record that Dr Misra’s assessment was undertaken by videoconference. She thus did not have the other reports and claimant’s impact statements, nor has she heard the claimant’s account before me. 57. For the reasons I give above there are inconsistencies in those accounts and I also note Dr Misra acknowledged (see (41)) an ‘unconscious magnification of symptoms’ by the claimant. 58. That consistency and credibility point is reinforced by another issue the respondent refers me to, namely that one of Case Number: 1306691/2019 - 15 - the principal adverse effects the claimant gives concerning his mental health impairments was the effect that has had on him socialising. In contrast Dr Misra indicated there was no significant disruption to the claimant’s life and socialisation was not affected [181 - 5.4.3]. 59. Those matters collectively call into question the account the claimant has given to different practitioners and the Tribunal over time, concerning matters that go to the core of his complaints here, whether there was a substantial adverse effect on his ability to undertake day to day activities. 60. They spread across the depth and breadth of his account and combined with the credibility points I refer to above lead me to conclude notwithstanding the assessment Dr Misra made as to the veracity of the claimant’s account (see (56)) that I should place no weight on the claimant’s account (unless supported elsewhere) and that includes that given to the various practitioners and thus the conclusions they reach as a result.”	A Rehman v DHL Services Limited	85. It is admitted that Dr Khan incorrectly and negligently advised Ms Meadows that she was not a carrier of a haemophilia gene, when in fact she was. As a result of this negligent advice, the claimant later conceived and gave birth to a son, A, who suffers from haemophilia. Had appropriate tests been arranged and the claimant been told, as she should have been, that she was carrying a haemophilia gene, she would have undergone foetal testing during her pregnancy and would have terminated her pregnancy when she found out that she would otherwise give birth to a child with haemophilia.	Khan v Meadows	35. As Lord Sumption has recently explained in Hughes-Holland , this principle was developed by the House of Lords in a series of cases concerning the negligent valuation of property following the property crash in the early 1990s: SAAMCO , Nykredit Mortgage Bank plc v Edward Erdman Group Ltd (formerly Edward Erdman (an unlimited company) (No 2) [1997] 1 WLR 1627 (“ Nykredit ”) and Platform Home Loans Ltd v Oyston Shipways Ltd [2000] 2 AC 190 (“ Platform Home Loans ”). The principle was applied by this court in relation to negligent misstatements by a solicitor in Hughes-Holland , and it was recognised by the Court of Appeal in the context of a medical negligence claim in Parkinson (above).

Both the House of Lords and the High Court of Australia held that it was sufficient that the psychiatric illness which the plaintiffs suffered were as a result of what the plaintiffs saw or heard in the aftermath of the accident at the scene or even at the hospital where the injured relatives were taken as a result of the accidents.	As Brennan J. stated:-	0.3553	0.3131	0.3553, 0.3394, 0.3376, 0.3353, 0.3337, 0.3279, 0.3256, 0.3238, 0.3097, 0.3073	44. The fourth question (the factual causation question) addresses the factual cause of the harm of which the claimant complains. Different legal rules have differing causal requirements, as Lord Hoffmann observed in his essay on causation in Richard Goldberg (ed), Perspectives on Causation (2011), p 9. In the case of the tort of negligence it is a generally accepted analysis to separate factual causation from the more restrictive requirements of legal causation which we address in the sixth question. In Kuwait Airways Corpn v Iraqi Airways Co (Nos 4 and 5) [2002] UKHL 19 ; [2002] 2 AC 883 the House of Lords was dealing with a claim for damages based on the tort of conversion arising out of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in which the defendants took possession of aircraft belonging to the claimants, four of which were destroyed on the ground by American bombing in Mosul in the first Gulf War and six of which had to be recovered from Iran at considerable cost. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead commenced his discussion of how one identifies the true loss of a claimant in cases of tort in words which are apposite to the tort of negligence (para 69): “I take as my starting point the commonly accepted approach that the extent of a defendant’s liability for the plaintiff’s loss calls for a twofold inquiry: whether the wrongful conduct causally contributed to the loss and, if it did, what is the extent of the loss for which the defendant ought to be held liable. The first of these inquiries, widely undertaken as a simple ‘but for’ test, is predominantly a factual inquiry.” (Khan v Meadows)	44.

The first of these inquiries, widely undertaken as a simple ‘but for’ test, is predominantly a factual inquiry.”	Khan v Meadows	62. In the Metall und Rohstoff case, cited at para 30 above, the 1968 convention did not apply to the issue of the court’s jurisdiction. The defendants were domiciled in the state of New York, and argued that, were any action to be brought against them, it should be brought there. But the Court of Appeal held that the English court had jurisdiction to determine one group of the various tort claims made against them. The court considered whether, for the purpose of rule 1(1)(f), the alleged torts within the group “resulted from [acts] committed” in England or alternatively in New York. It was enough, so the court held at p 449D, that “as a matter of substance” the acts were committed here. But the court also considered whether “the damage was sustained” in England or alternatively in Switzerland or Belgium. It observed at p 437C-D:	Four Seasons Holdings Incorporated v Brownlie	12. In the statement of facts and issues the parties agreed that it was “reasonably foreseeable that as a consequence of [Dr Khan’s] breach of duty, the appellant could give birth to a child that suffered from a condition such as autism as well as haemophilia”.	Khan v Meadows	91. Lord Phillips prefers an analysis according to which the present case is governed by a principle of remoteness which he derives from Addis v Gramaphone Co Ltd [1909] AC 488 . That case establishes “that an employee cannot recover damages for injured feelings, mental distress or damage to his reputation, arising out of the manner of his dismissal”: Johnson v Unisys Ltd , para 44, per Lord Hoffmann. But it is questionable whether this is a principle of remoteness, as opposed to causation: see eg Mahmud v Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA [1998] AC 20 , 51D-E, per Lord Steyn and Johnson v Unisys Ltd , paras 39 and 44, citing McLachlin J ’s dictum in Wallace v United Grain Growers Ltd (1997) 152 DLR (4th) 1, 39 that “A wrong arises only if the employer breaches the contract by failing to give the dismissed employee reasonable notice of termination” in support of a conclusion that “the only loss caused by a wrongful dismissal flows from a failure to give proper notice or make payment in lieu”.	Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital NHS Foundation Trust	35. As Lord Sumption has recently explained in Hughes-Holland , this principle was developed by the House of Lords in a series of cases concerning the negligent valuation of property following the property crash in the early 1990s: SAAMCO , Nykredit Mortgage Bank plc v Edward Erdman Group Ltd (formerly Edward Erdman (an unlimited company) (No 2) [1997] 1 WLR 1627 (“ Nykredit ”) and Platform Home Loans Ltd v Oyston Shipways Ltd [2000] 2 AC 190 (“ Platform Home Loans ”). The principle was applied by this court in relation to negligent misstatements by a solicitor in Hughes-Holland , and it was recognised by the Court of Appeal in the context of a medical negligence claim in Parkinson (above).	Khan v Meadows	623. We have taken RS’ mental health into account when evaluating her evidence.	KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT	19. First, a person owes a duty of care not to cause physical damage to another person’s property (such as a car) and, if in breach of that duty, is liable to pay damages to compensate that person for the diminution in value of the property and any other financial loss consequent on the damage: see eg SCM (United Kingdom) Ltd v WJ Whittall & Son Ltd [1971] 1 QB 337 ; Spartan Steel & Alloys Ltd v Martin & Co (Contractors) Ltd [1973] QB 27 . This is subject to the general principles which limit the recovery of damages in tort, including the limitation that loss is not recoverable if it is too remote a consequence of the wrong.	Armstead v Royal  Sun Alliance Insurance Company Ltd	83. Instead of obtaining e.g. a psychologist’s report, the Claimant sought to rely upon an article written by psychiatrists as to the pathological effects of significant humiliation upon a person’s mental health. For reasons already discussed under Ground 4, such generalised material is unlikely to be of assistance as it says nothing about the Claimant’s own state.	AB v CD Ltd	2. Although the proceedings in court are designed to resolve such disagreements, the effect of their commencement and of any public hearing is typically to expand the dispute into the public domain, because of reporting by the press, radio and television and through dissemination on social media. At that point the experience of recent cases is that a disagreement about the child’s best interests can turn into an uncontrolled furore in the public arena, in which some of the protagonists resort to abuse directed at members of the clinical team treating the child, for example in the form of vilification on social media, or by shouting abuse at staff outside the hospital concerned. This can amount to harassment of the staff affected, leading to distress, disillusionment, psychological illness, demotivation and even withdrawal from that vital work. It can also have an adverse effect upon the quality of the treatment being given to the sick child.	Abbasi and another v Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust	190. Considering more precisely the point in time at which a claimant acquires “knowledge” for the purposes of sections 11(4) and 14(1) of the 1980 Act , the majority of the court in AB v Ministry of Defence endorsed the test earlier approved by the House of Lords in relation to claims falling under section 14A (inserted by the Latent Damage Act 1977), which applies to actions for damages for negligence, other than those involving personal injuries. In Haward v Fawcetts [2006] UKHL 9 ; [2006] 1 WLR 682 , para 9, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead stated:	Test Claimants in the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation and others v Commissioners for Her
Tribunal	Majority	Ann Kelly v Fergus Hennessy [1995] 3 IR 253.xml	End	The fact that the plaintiff may never fully recover implies that she may partially recover. A psychiatric illness from which there is partial recovery remains a serious problem, and this fact was clearly taken into consideration by the learned trial judge when he determined the quantum.	In these circumstances the sum is not excessive or so excessive as to warrant interference by this Court.		0.4638	0.2542	0.4638, 0.4619, 0.4508, 0.4261, 0.4241, 0.4120, 0.3904, 0.3816, 0.3789, 0.3720	244. In the first of the quartet of cases, Clydebank Engineering , the House of Lords held that the courts would not enforce a measure that was extravagant and unconscionable: Earl of Halsbury LC at p 10, Lord Davey at p 16 and Lord Robertson at p 20. Different expressions were used to describe the manifestly excessive nature of the measure in comparison with the interest which the challenged clause protected. But at its heart was the idea of exorbitance or gross excessiveness. (Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi)	244. In the first of the quartet of cases, Clydebank Engineering , the House of Lords held that the courts would not enforce a measure that was extravagant and unconscionable: Earl of Halsbury LC at p 10, Lord Davey at p 16 and Lord Robertson at p 20. Different expressions were used to describe the manifestly excessive nature of the measure in comparison with the interest which the challenged clause protected. But at its heart was the idea of exorbitance or gross excessiveness.	Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi	27. She noted that the £1,000 maximum leaves open the possibility of a total sum greater than £1,000, because an award may be made under Rule 39(1) in respect of “any specific allegation or argument”, and there may be more than one of those ( Wright v Nipponkoa Insurance at para 77). She therefore suggested that, in addition to the check based on affordability, there should be a final check based on proportionality (which is not a check required by the words of Rule 39 itself). See Wright v Nipponkoa Insurance at para 78:- “It is right that (…) the Employment Tribunal Rules 2013 may well result in separate awards being made in relation to different allegations and that this might give rise to a total level of award of some significantly higher value than the individual orders. When making such deposit orders Employment Tribunals should indeed stand back and look at the total sum awarded and consider the question of proportionality before finalising the orders made.”	Addison Lee v H Afshar  Ors	14. Conclusion on proportionality	Shvidler v Secretary of State for Foreign Commonwealth and Development Affairs	29. In Hemdan v Ishmail [2017] ICR 486 , Simler J (President of the EAT) also considered the question of proportionality, but linked it particularly to the question of affordability, because of the potential obstacle that a deposit order might present to access to justice. She said (at para 15): “…the making of a deposit order is a matter of discretion and does not follow automatically. It is a power to be exercised in accordance with the overriding objective, having regard to all the circumstances of the particular case.”	Addison Lee v H Afshar  Ors	196. Mr de Waal and Mr Butcher point out that the sum of £85 or £50 could well represent a large part of a car driver’s or owner’s weekly income, eg in the case of a pensioner, and that, even adjacently to Chelmsford Station it is likely well to exceed any sum that would be payable for parking for say three hours in a car park charging according to time stayed. They also submit that ParkingEye’s level of charging compares unfavourably with that authorised under the Civil Enforcement of Parking Contraventions (England) General Regulations 2007 (SI 2007/3483) and the Civil Enforcement of Parking Contraventions (Guidelines on Levels of Charges) (England) Order (SI 2007/3487). These authorise a penalty charge of £50, reducible, if paid within 21 days, in the case of a contravention detected by an approved device (such as CCTV) or 14 days in other cases, to £25 for parking in contravention of one of the statutory or regulatory provisions listed in Schedule 7, paragraph 4 of the Traffic Management Act 2004 . But a scheme relating to the enforcement of parking and parking charges by public authorities in public places is in no way analogous to that in issue on this appeal. Further, merely because statute sets a lower level does not mean that a higher level would not have been reasonable.	Cavendish Square Holding BV v Talal El Makdessi	28. However, she was not thereby writing additional words into Rule 39, or giving anything more than guidance. Standing back and looking at the total sum awarded is a matter of good sense and good judgment, consistent with the making of a deposit order being the exercise of a discretion. This is clear from the remainder of the passage in which Judge Eady both accepted the Employment Judge’s reference to what was “appropriate” rather than what was “proportionate”, and emphasised, also, the importance of the Employment Judge’s discretion. She said (at para 78 of Wright v Nipponkoa Insurance ):- “In this case, however, I am satisfied that the Employment Judge did. He expressly had regard to what he described as “appropriate”. In this case, it is clear that this was a reference to what was proportionate. The Employment Judge expressly had regard to the totality of the award made as comprised of each deposit order, allowing for the maximum that could be awarded under the Rules. He did not make the maximum awards that he could have done but made orders which gave rise to a total sum that seemed to be proportionate – “appropriate” – when taking into account the number of allegations to which the orders related and the Claimant’s means. That was a proportionate view on the totality of the award and a conclusion that was entirely open to the Employment Judge as an exercise of his discretion.”	Addison Lee v H Afshar  Ors	39. In Rogers v Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council [2006] EWCA Civ 1134 , [2007] 1 WLR 808 , the Court of Appeal had to consider whether an ATE premium was recoverable by a successful claimant. The court addressed the issue of proportionality at paras 102 to 106. The damages were agreed in the sum of £3,105 plus interest. The case went to trial and the claimant won. The deputy district judge assessed the costs in the sum of £16,821. This included an ATE premium of £5,103. The Court of Appeal held that the premium was recoverable as a proportionate expense if it was necessarily incurred, even if the amount was large in comparison with the amount of damages reasonably claimed. The court said:	Coventry and others v Lawrence and another	80. The contractual provisions in this case pose unusual interpretative challenges, which may call for unusual solutions. The leases with which we are concerned are of 25 chalets within Oxwich Leisure Park, in South Wales. It is an estate of 91 such chalets first developed in 1974. It is in an attractive holiday location close to Oxwich Beach on the Gower Peninsular. The challenges arise from a combination of factors. The intention, stated in the preamble to each lease, was that they should be “upon terms similar in all respects …”. Yet we are faced with five forms of service charge provision, agreed over a period of some 20 years, the variations in which at first sight defy rational analysis. As interpreted by the Court of Appeal, they would lead over the course of the leases to supposedly “proportionate” service charges becoming wholly disproportionate to the costs of the relevant services, to extreme and arbitrary differences between the treatment of different groups of leases within the estate, and to the prospect in the foreseeable future of potentially catastrophic financial consequences for the lessees directly concerned.	Arnold v Britton and others	45. I agree with the Court of Appeal.	Gard Marine and Energy Limited v China National Chartering Company Limited and another	49. A rough calculation on this basis produces a result so close to that which the judge produced that it would be wrong for an appellate court to interfere. If we take the value of the property as £60,000 in late 1993 (or £70,000 in late 1995) and the value in 2008 as £245,000, and share the £60,000 (or £70,000) equally between the parties, but leave the balance to Ms Jones, that gives him £30,000 (£35,000) and her £215,000 (£210,000), roughly 12% (14%) and 88% (86%) respectively. This calculation ignores the mortgage, which may be the correct approach, as in 2008 the mortgage debt was almost fully covered by the endowment policy which was always meant to discharge it. Introducing the mortgage liability in 1993 (or 1995) into the calculation would be to Mr Kernott’s disadvantage, because at that stage the endowment policy would not have been sufficient to discharge the debt, so the equity would have been less.

Even then, there was no reference to police powers to stop a parade which, because it had not been notified, was illegal. Indeed, it referred to the “absence of a legislative (regulatory) fix” under the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act.	DB v Chief Constable of Police Service of Northern Ireland	96. In Stewart & Co v J & A Dennistoun (1854) 16 D 1061 the pursuers were the owners of a vessel chartered by Morton & Co. The defenders had undertaken to pay a specified sum, representing two-thirds of the freight due by Morton & Co, on production of a certificate that a full cargo of flour had been loaded at New Orleans to be taken to Hobson’s Bay in Victoria. The certificate was produced. Morton & Co ordered the defenders not to pay, however, on the ground that the pursuers had not, in fact, loaded a full cargo. The pursuers sued the defenders for the specified sum and, of consent, Morton & Co were sisted as parties. Morton & Co had meanwhile raised an action for damages against the pursuers in the Court of Session. The defenders accepted that, in view of the certificate, the pursuers had a liquid claim against them, but submitted that the action should be allowed to lie over ex aequitate , pending the resolution of Morton & Co’s action of damages against the pursuers. The First Division held that the sum should be paid. Lord President McNeill acknowledged, however, that the court had an equitable power to delay decree for payment, when he observed, at p 1064: “Perhaps if the case had been set down for trial next week, and no risk as to the condition of parties, it would be a different matter. But when the defence is in reference to an action of damages involving an inquiry into disputed facts in New Orleans and Hobson’s Bay, it becomes a more serious question for the intervention of the Court.” Similarly, Lord Robertson said, also at p 1064, “Had this action been with issues adjusted, and set down for the next sittings, one might have been induced to interfere ex equitate : but it will never do to suspend this liquid obligation till proofs are taken at New Orleans and Hobson’s Bay.” In short, the circumstances favoured following the general rule.

Having referred to the likely publicity that the arrival of a British police team in Malaysia would cause, especially if the team wished to take evidence in the area of Batang Kali itself, he expressed doubts about the reliability of any evidence which was given, in the light of the passage of time and also because of the possible incentive of compensation.

On the same date, Mr Chang, purportedly acting on behalf of the Republic, signed a guarantee between the Republic, CSI and CSAG which nominally secured Proindicus’ obligations under the Proindicus facility. After variations were made to the Proindicus supply contract, Mr Chang signed (purportedly on behalf of the Republic) letters confirming the Proindicus guarantee.

On 20 May 2014, VTB, Palomar Capital Advisors AG (“Palomar”) and MAM (as borrower) entered into a five-year US$540 million facility agreement to finance the contract price under the MAM supply contract.

Lord Clarke comments at para 130 that he cannot conceive of circumstances in which the court could properly make an order for the use of “closed material procedure” as defined. And at para 152 he states that such a course would require Parliamentary intervention. I agree. The common law develops incrementally. The change envisaged by the preliminary issue would be fundamental. Only Parliament could bring about such a change.	Al Rawi and others v The Security Service and others	8. On 27 May 2022 Mr Mireku emailed CSM Soman Krishnan asking to work an overtime shift on 4 June 2022.

UKSC	Majority	Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100.xml	Middle	It now becomes necessary to consider the cases which have been referred to in the Courts below as laying down the proposition that no duty to take care is owed to the consumer in such a case as this.	In Dixon v. Bell , 1816 5 M. & S. 198, the defendant had left a loaded gun at his lodgings and sent his servant, a mulatto girl aged about 13 or 14, for the gun, asking the landlord to remove the priming and give it her. The landlord did remove the priming and gave it to the girl, who later levelled it at the plaintiff's small son, drew the trigger and injured the boy. The action was in case for negligently entrusting the young servant with the gun. The jury at the trial before Lord Ellenborough had returned a verdict for the plaintiff. A motion by Sir William Garrow, Attorney-General, for a new trial was dismissed by the Court. Lord Ellenborough and Bayley J.J., the former remarking that it was incumbent on the defendant, who by charging the gun had made it capable of doing mischief, to render it safe and innoxious.	"In, Langridge v. Levy (1837) 2 M. & W. 519 (1838) 4 M. & W. 337 the action was in case and the declaration alleged that the defendant by falsely and fraudulently warranting a gun to have been made by Nock and to be a good, safe and secure gun, sold the gun to the plaintiff's father for the use of himself and his son, and that one of his sons confiding in the warranty used the gun, which burst and injured him. Plea not guilty and no warranty as alleged. The report is not very satisfactory. No evidence is reported of any warranty or statement except that the gun was an elegant twist gun by Nock. The judge left to the jury whether the defendant had warranted the gun to be by Nock and to be safe: whether it was in fact unsafe: and whether the defendant warranted it to be safe knowing that it was not so. The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff. It appears to have been argued that the plaintiff could recover wherever there is a breach of duty imposed on the defendant by contract or otherwise, and the plaintiff is injured by reason of its breach: by this is meant apparently that the duty need not be owed to the plaintiff but that he can take advantage of the breach of a duty owed to a third party. This contention was negatived by the Court, who held, however, that the plaintiff could recover if a representation known to be false was made to a third person with the intention that a chattel should be used by the plaintiff, even though it does not appear that the defendant intended the false representation to be communicated to him. See per Parke B. 2 M. & W. at p. 531. The same view was adopted by the Exchequer Chamber, the user by the plaintiff being treated by the Court as one of the acts contemplated by the fraudulent defendant. It is unnecessary to consider whether the proposition can be supported in its widest form. It is sufficient to say that the case was based as I think in the pleading and certainly in the judgment on the ground of fraud, and it appears to add nothing of value positively or negatively to the present discussion. Winterbottom v. Wright 1842 10 M. & W. 109 was a case decided on a demurrer. The plaintiff had demurred to two of the pleas as to which there was no decision by the Court, but on the hearing of the plaintiff's demurrer the Court in accordance with the practice of the day were entitled to consider the whole record including the declaration, and coming to the conclusion that the declaration disclosed no cause of action, gave judgment for the defendant - See Sutton's ""Personal Actions at Common Law"" page 113. The advantage of the procedure is that we are in a position to know the precise issue at law which arose for determination. The declaration was in case and alleged that the defendant had contracted with the Postmaster-General to provide the mail coach to convey mails from Hartford to Holyhead and to keep the mails in safe condition, that Atkinson and others with notice of the said contract bad contracted with the Postmaster-General to convey the road mailcoach from Hartford to Holyhead : and that the plaintiff relying on the said first contract hired himself to Atkinson to drive the mailcoach, but that the defendant so negligently conducted himself and so utterly disregarded his aforesaid contract that the defendant having the means of knowing and well knowing all the aforesaid premises, the mailcoach being in a dangerous condition owing to certain latent defects and to no other cause gave way, whereby the plaintiff was thrown from his seat and injured. It is to be observed that no negligence apart from breach of contract was alleged, in other words no duty was alleged other than the duty arising out of the contract : it is not stated that the defendant knew or ought to have known of the latent defect. The argument of the defendant was that on the face of the declaration the wrong arose merely out of the breach of a contract, and that only a party to the contract could sue. The Court of Exchequer adopted that view, as clearly appears from the judgments of Alderson and Rolfe B.B. There are dicta by Lord Abinger which are too wide as to an action of negligence being confined to cases of breach of a public duty. The actual decision appears to have been manifestly right; no duty to the plaintiff arose out of the contract; and the duty of the defendant under the contract with the Postmaster General to put the coach in good repair could not have involved those direct relations with the servant of the persons whom the Postmaster-General employed to drive the coach as would give rise to a duty of care owed to such servant. We now come to Langmeid v. Holliday"	0.336	0.3678	0.3360, 0.3275, 0.3253, 0.3118, 0.3113, 0.3069, 0.3017, 0.3011, 0.2989, 0.2966	82. For these reasons, which in their essentials (at para 77) align with the reasons given by Lord Hodge and Lord Sales (albeit not with all aspects of their conceptual analysis of the tort of negligence), I agree that this appeal should be dismissed. (Khan v Meadows)	82. For these reasons, which in their essentials (at para 77) align with the reasons given by Lord Hodge and Lord Sales (albeit not with all aspects of their conceptual analysis of the tort of negligence), I agree that this appeal should be dismissed.	Khan v Meadows	80. In summary, safety must, in my view, be judged according to the general knowledge and standards of the times. The onus is on the employee to show that the workplace was unsafe in this basic sense.	Baker v Quantum Clothing Group Limited and others	8. Both conditions are now reflected in section 4(1) of the Powers of Attorney Act 1971 , as regards authority conferred by a power of attorney. The first condition is perhaps self-evident, but so far as authority is required, it is supplied by the decisions of the Privy Council in Esteban de Comas v Prost and Kohler (1865) 3 Moo PC NS 158 and Frith v Frith [1906] AC 254 . The second condition was established in Walsh v Whitcomb , supra , where the exception was said to apply in “every case where a power of attorney is necessary to effectuate any security”. In Smart v Sandars (1848) 2 CB 895, 917-918, commonly regarded as the leading case, Wilde CJ, delivering the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, declared that:	Bailey and another v Angoves PTY Limited	51. Cases such as In re S-B are vanishingly rare. As McFarlane LJ pointed out in the Court of Appeal [2012] 3 WLR 952 , para 109, the Lancashire case [2000] 2 AC 147 , in respect of the child-minder, was “truly a one-point case. There were no other adverse findings made against the childminder” (he says “other” but he must mean no adverse findings) (para 108). Likewise, In re S-B “was [a case] of a one-off (‘whodunit’) injury, there was no question of failure to protect and no finding of collusion” (para 111). Even in In re F [2011] 2 FLR 856 , there were no adverse findings against the father (para 112). Most care cases are not “one-off whodunit” cases. They come with a multitude of facts.	In the matter of J Children	17. Yip J stated, correctly, in para 26 that the purpose of the service offered by the defendant in this case “was not to prevent the claimant from having any child but rather, ultimately, to prevent her having a child with haemophilia”. But she also observed: “[The claimant] wished to establish whether she was a carrier. If the service had been performed properly, she would have discovered that she was. She would then have taken steps to ensure that she did not continue with a pregnancy that was going to lead to the birth of a child with haemophilia. In that way, the birth of [A] would have been avoided. Just as in Groom , it can be said that the defendant’s breach of duty caused the claimant’s pregnancy to continue when it would otherwise have been terminated.”	Khan v Meadows	42. The third question (the breach question) logically follows the first two questions. Having established as a fact what the defendant had done or omitted to do, the court asks if the defendant has failed to show reasonable care in relation to a risk of harm which was within the scope of his or her duty as determined by the answer to the second question.	Khan v Meadows	25. In the light of this court’s decision in Vedanta , it is clear that this is not the correct approach because “the liability of parent companies in relation to the activities of their subsidiaries is not, of itself, a distinct category of liability in common law negligence” - per Lord Briggs at para 49. It raises no novel issues of law and is to be determined on ordinary, general principles of the law of tort regarding the imposition of a duty of care. In the context of parent/subsidiary relationships, whether a duty of care arises:	Okpabi and others v Royal Dutch Shell Plc and another	(iii) Factual causation is satisfied. The defendant admits that “but for” her negligence A would not have been born because the claimant would have discovered during her pregnancy that he was afflicted by haemophilia and would, therefore, have undergone a termination of the pregnancy (see the judgment of Nicola Davies LJ in the Court of Appeal, [2019] EWCA Civ 152 ; [2019] 4 WLR 26 , para 2).	Khan v Meadows	79. Scholars have long debated whether the conventional conceptual structure of the tort of negligence could be improved and, in particular, whether the duty of care is an unnecessary element: see, eg, Donal Nolan, “Deconstructing the Duty of Care” (2013) 129 LQR 559. But for the purposes of this judgment, I have had in mind, and would prefer to adhere to, a relatively conventional approach which sees the tort of negligence as involving seven main questions. They are as follows: (1) Was there a duty of care owed by the defendant to the claimant? (the duty of care question) (2) Was there a breach of the duty of care? (the breach, or standard of care, question)	Khan v Meadows	4. A child may be protected, not only if he is actually suffering harm as a result of a lack of reasonable parental care, but also if it is likely that he will do so in the future. But how is a court to be satisfied that it is likely that this particular child – the child concerned - will suffer significant harm in the future? It has twice been held in the House of Lords that the mere possibility, however real, that another child may have been harmed in the past by a person who is now looking after the child with whom the court is now concerned is not sufficient. The court has to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that this person actually did harm that other child: see In re H [1996] AC 563 and In re B [2009] AC 11 . But in both those cases, it was not established that the other child had been harmed at all. The issue in this case is whether it makes a difference that another child has indeed been harmed in the past and there is a possibility that this parent was responsible for that harm.	In the matter of J Children
UKSC	Majority	Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] UKHL 100.xml	End	My Lords, the recognition by counsel that the law of Scotland applicable to the case was the same as the law of England implied that there was no special doctrine of Scots law which either the appellant or the respondent could invoke to support her or his case and your Lordships have thus been relieved of the necessity of a separate consideration of the law of Scotland. For myself I am satisfied that there is no specialty of Scots law involved and that the case may safely be decided on principles common to both systems. I am happy to think that in their relation to the practical problem of everyday life which this appeal presents the legal systems of the two countries are in no way at variance and that the principles of both alike are sufficiently consonant with justice and common sense to admit of the claim which appellant seeks to establish.	I am anxious to emphasise that the principle of judgment which commends itself to me does not give rise to the sort of objection stated by Parke, B., at p. 768, in Longmeid v Holliday (cit. sup.), where he said :-	"""But it would be going much too far to say that so much care is required in the ordinary intercourse of life between one individual and another that if a machine, not in its nature dangerous, a carriage for instance, but which might become so by a latent defect entirely unknown although discoverable by the exercise of ordinary care should be lent or given by one person, even by the person who manufactured it to another, the former should be answerable to the latter for a subsequent damage accruing by the use of it."""	0.6262	0.4384	0.6262, 0.5634, 0.5329, 0.5163, 0.5082, 0.5045, 0.5019, 0.5007, 0.4913, 0.4859	29.

Furthermore, Sir James Eadie QC, continuing the practice established in The Gagara and The Fagernes , stated in the course of his oral submissions before us:	Maduro Board of the Central Bank of Venezuela v Guaidó Board of the Central Bank of Venezuela	14. The leading authorities are well-known and have been reviewed many times, most recently by this court in In re S-B [2010] 1 AC 678 . However, as Mr Cobb correctly observes, they were not reviewed with this precise issue in mind and it is therefore necessary to consider them briefly once more.	In the matter of J Children	159. The parties and the interveners have provided such a considerable body of submissions and material, containing a wealth of learning, that it is hardly possible for a single judgment, or even more than one, to capture all the points that could be made. I agree with the judgment of Lord Hodge but there are a few further points I wish to make which seem to me to reinforce the overall conclusions which this court has reached, or in paras 164, 171, 185 and 188 below to qualify them.	Halliburton Company v Chubb Bermuda Insurance Ltd formerly known as Ace Bermuda Insurance Ltd	106. For the reasons we have given, we would dismiss the appeal. Our reasoning differs from that in the two leading Court of Appeal decisions in this area, Natt v Osman and Elim Court , which require qualification as explained above.	A1 Properties Sunderland Ltd v Tudor Studios RTM Company Ltd	123. We therefore agree with the view of Moore-Bick LJ in the Sulamérica case quoted at para 104 above and also with statement of Longmore LJ in C v D [2007] EWCA Civ 1282 ; [2008] Bus LR 843, para 26, that:	Enka Insaat Ve Sanayi AS v OOO Insurance Company Chubb	58. I would hope that this decision will lay to rest the remaining difficulties, and that it will not be necessary to revisit this question by reconsideration of the correctness of Stack v Dowden , by which this court is bound (subject to the application of Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) [1966] 1 WLR 1234 regarding departure from previous decisions). It should not be necessary because the differences in reasoning are largely terminological or conceptual and are likely to make no difference in practice. But should it be necessary, the court (no doubt with a panel of seven or nine) would need much fuller argument (together with citation of the enormous critical literature which the decision has spawned) than was presented to the court on this appeal.	Jones v Kernott	"“16 Cases as such do not bind; their rationes decidendi do. While there has been much academic discussion of the proper way of determining the ratio of a case, we find the clearest and most persuasive guidance, at least in a case such as the present where one is dealing with a single judgment, to be that of Professor Cross in Cross & Harris, Precedent in English Law, 4th ed (1991), p 72: ""The ratio decidendi of a case is any rule of law expressly or impliedly treated by the judge as a necessary step in reaching his conclusion, having regard to the line of reasoning adopted by him."""	Alistdair Barclay Brown v Richard John Ridley  Anor	60. Accordingly, in agreement with the reasons given by Lord Hodge in this court, Davis LJ in the Court of Appeal and Morgan J in the High Court, I would dismiss this appeal, and I do not consider that the appellants are assisted by the additional argument raised in this court. I should, however, make five final points.	Arnold v Britton and others	58. For those reasons, I would myself dismiss the appeal and uphold the decision of the Court of Appeal, although on somewhat different grounds from those stated by it.	Birch v Birch

On the issue of proscription, it is said that such status would exacerbate the potential risk to those with links to a relevant organisation. On the other hand de-proscription or no proscription at all does not necessarily mean that the Sri Lankan authorities do not consider the group or its members to be a serious threat to national security. The example is given of the LTTE itself. The organisation was only proscribed between 1998 and 2002, and then from 2009 to the present day. The years when it was not proscribed did not preclude the authorities from having an obvious adverse interest in it.	KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT	329. The often bloody history of separatism in the Sri Lankan context is well-documented and does not require recitation. Article 157A of the Sri Lankan Constitution, as amended, serves as the bedrock for successive governments’ policies towards the notion of a separate Tamil homeland. Article 157A, brought in by the 6 th Amendment to the Constitution on 8 August 1983, provides, in so far as is relevant: “157A. (1) No person shall, directly or indirectly, in or outside Sri Lanka, support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka. (2) No political party or other association or organisation shall have as one of its aims or objectives the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka.”	KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT	(2) When section 32(1)(c) was enacted, it was not contemplated that it might extend to actions for the restitution of money paid under a mistake of law: no such action was recognised at that time.

Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, ‘Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam’ undated	KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT	474. The relevant contextual factors are as follows: i. the implacable hostility of GoSL to the concept of separatism in general; ii. the post- GJ pronouncements by leading establishment figures as to the view taken of the section of the Tamil diaspora with which we are concerned, together with our findings that these have not simply been rhetorical in nature; iii. our analysis of some of these diaspora organisations and the clear fact that the United Kingdom remains, eleven years after the end of the civil war, a “hotspot” for separatist and anti-government activities; iv. the advent of proscription since GJ was decided; v. the unsuccessful (perceived) LTTE-inspired attempts at committing violent acts within Sri Lanka in recent years, the last of these being in July 2020;	KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT	342. The foregoing is also in keeping with what the previous government stated in November 2015 when amending the list of proscribed groups and individuals deemed to be involved with terrorism (of which, more will be said, below). The LTTE’s current listing entry includes the following: “Despite the military defeat of the LTTE in Sri Lanka its front organisations and structures continues to remain active overseas promoting LTTE ideology of creating a mono ethnic separate state of Tamil Eelam through terrorist means. Three clear resurgence attempts within the country with assistance from pro LTTE groups operating overseas (Year 2012-2014).”	KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT	341. These incidents certainly cannot be said to equate to general operational capabilities of the LTTE within Sri Lanka or to a meaningful resurgence of that organisation. However, they do add force to the appellants’ argument that the rhetoric and the expression of determination to prevent any form of resurgent separatism does in fact have a basis in reality. In our view, the reality in this equation must be seen in the context of GoSL’s authoritarian nature and Sri Lanka’s violent history over the last four decades.

The literal translation makes it a guarantee -""not to interfere with"" rather than a guarantee to  ""respect."" Does a law which - effectively prevents the plaintiff and her husband in their particular circumstances from resorting to the use of contraceptives for the purpose of ensuring that the plaintiff will not have a nother pregnancy ""respect"" or ""not interfere with"" the right of family privacy of the plaintiff and her husband?"" In this context, I wish to emphasise that this judgment is confined to contraceptives as such; it is not intended to apply to abortifacients,  though called contraceptives, as in the case of abortifacients entirely different considerations may arise. In  my opinion, a statute which makes it a criminal offence for the plaintiff or her husband to import or to acquire possession of contraceptives for  use within their marriage is an unjustifiable invasion of privacy in the conduct of the most intimate of all their personal relationships."	"In Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) 381 U.S 479,  which was another case dealing with the same Connecticut law, Douglas J. delivered the judgment of the Supreme Court of the United States; at p. 485 of the report he said: _  ""The present case, then, concerns a relationship lying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees. And it concerns a law which, in forbidding the use  of contraceptives rather than regulating their manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship. Such a law cannot stand in light of the familiar pr inciple, so often applied by this Court, that a  governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms NAACP v. Alabama.   Would we allow the police to search the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms for telltale signs of the use of contraceptives? The very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship. We deal with a  right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights-older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a  coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that  promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects."""		0.4227	0.4235	0.4227, 0.4072, 0.3940, 0.3790, 0.3778, 0.3736, 0.3707, 0.3693, 0.3612, 0.3530	(4) Even if it were legitimate to impose the marriage condition for the purpose of protecting the status of marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman, that could not justify imposing the same condition on eligibility for a state retirement pension, to which marital status is likewise irrelevant. (MB v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions)	(4) Even if it were legitimate to impose the marriage condition for the purpose of protecting the status of marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman, that could not justify imposing the same condition on eligibility for a state retirement pension, to which marital status is likewise irrelevant.	MB v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions	35. This question was not addressed in the Court of Appeal, as they had concluded that this was direct discrimination. It was addressed by the judge, who confessed that he did not find regulation 3(3)(d) easy to interpret. Worded as it is, I understand what he means. Mr and Mrs Bull seek to justify their policy by reference to a deeply held belief that sexual intercourse outside marriage is sinful. Can that belief be a “matter other than [their] sexual orientation”? I am prepared to accept that it can, not least because it covers all kinds of unmarried couple. But it would be hard to find that a belief that sexual intercourse between civil partners was sinful was a “matter other than [their] sexual orientation”, because by definition such sexual intercourse has to be between persons of the same sex.	Bull and another v Hall and another	25. Does it make a difference that this couple were in a civil partnership? In my view, it does. The concept of marriage being applied by Mr and Mrs Bull was the Christian concept of the union of one man and one woman. That is clear from the reference to “heterosexual married couples” in the statement of policy which was current at the time; it is even clearer from the amended policy, which read “… out of a deep regard for marriage (being the union of one man to one woman for life to the exclusion of all others) …”; and was made clear to the couple by what Mr Quinn said when Mr Preddy told him that they were civil partners.	Bull and another v Hall and another	34. Mr and Mrs Bull argue that they should not be compelled to run their business in a way which conflicts with their deeply held religious beliefs. They should not be obliged to facilitate what they regard as sin by allowing unmarried couples to share a bed. A fair balance should be struck between their right to manifest their faith and the right of Mr Preddy and Mr Bull to obtain goods, facilities and services without discrimination on grounds of their sexual orientation.	Bull and another v Hall and another	162. Once again, I adhere to the view expressed in MacLeod , that there may be important policy considerations justifying a different approach as between agreements made before and after a marriage. This is recognised in those jurisdictions which have legislated to make ante-nuptial agreements enforceable. It is, for example, common for them to contain safeguards which do not apply to agreements made after the marriage. Most important is whether, and if so in what circumstances, couples should be allowed to contract out of the fundamental obligations of the married state which they are about to enter.	Radmacher formerly Granatino v Granatino	1. Is it lawful for a Christian hotel keeper, who sincerely believes that sexual relations outside marriage are sinful, to refuse a double-bedded room to a same sex couple? Does it make any difference that the couple have entered into a civil partnership? These are questions which would have been unthinkable less than two decades ago. That they can now be asked is a measure of how far we have come in the recognition of same sex relationships since the repeal of section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988 , in Scotland in 2000 and in England and Wales in 2003.	Bull and another v Hall and another	8. At the time that the Gender Recognition Act was passed a valid marriage could subsist in law only between a man and a woman. This had always been the law, but had been confirmed by the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973 , section 11 (c). For this reason, the 2004 Act made special provision for married applicants, whose change of legally recognised gender would otherwise have resulted in their being married to a person of the same gender as themselves. This will be referred to below as the “marriage condition”. By section 4(2) an unmarried applicant who satisfied the criteria for gender recognition in sections 2 and 3 was entitled to a full gender recognition certificate, whereas by section 4(3) a married applicant who satisfied the same criteria was entitled only to an interim gender recognition certificate.	MB v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions	38. Leaving aside the usual contractual reasons, such as misrepresentation or undue influence, the only other such reason might be the old rule that agreements providing for a future separation are contrary to public policy. But the reasons given for that rule were founded on the enforceable duty of husband and wife to live together. This meant that there should be no inducement to either of them to live apart: see, for example, H v W 3 K & J 382, 386. There is no longer an enforceable duty upon husband and wife to live together. The husband’s right to use self-help to keep his wife at home has gone. He can now be guilty of the offences of kidnapping and false imprisonment if he tries to do so: see R v Reid [1973] QB 299 . The decree of restitution of conjugal rights, disobedience to which did for a while involve penal sanctions, has not since the abolition of those sanctions been used to force the couple to live together: see Nanda v Nanda [1968] P 351 . It was abolished by the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Act 1970 , at the same time as the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1970 abolished all the common law actions against third parties who interfered between husband and wife.	Radmacher formerly Granatino v Granatino	336. It is difficult to envisage a more controversial issue than the proper limits of the law governing abortion. Diametrically opposed views, and every shade of opinion in between, are held with equal sincerity and conviction. Each side of the debate appeals to moral or religious values which are held with passionate intensity. In a democracy on the British model, the natural place for that debate to be resolved is in the legislature.	In the matter of an application by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for Judicial Review	31. It used to be contrary to public policy for a married couple who were living together, or a couple about to get married, to make an agreement that provided for the contingency that they might separate. Marriage involved a duty to live together and an agreement making provision for the possibility of separation might act as an encouragement to separate. Such agreements were void and the court would pay no regard to them: Cocksedge v Cocksedge (1844) 14 Sim 244; 13 LJ Ch 384; H v W (1857) 3 K & J 382. The same was not true of an agreement to separate or an agreement that governed a separation that had already taken place. Lord Atkin in Hyman v Hyman [1929] AC 601 at p 625-626 gave a short history of such contracts and commented on their effect: “We have to deal with a separation deed, a class of document which has had a chequered career at law. Not recognized by the Ecclesiastical Courts, such contracts were enforced by the common law. Equity at first frowned. Lord Eldon doubted but enforced them: cf. St. John v. St. John (1803) Ves. 525, 529 and Bateman v. Countess of Ross (1813) 1 Dow 235; and see the arguments of Sir Fitzroy Kelly and Mr Turner and of Mr Bethell in Wilson v. Wilson (1848) 1 H. L. C. 538, 550-553, 564, 565. Finally they were fully recognized in equity by Lord Westbury’s leading judgment in Hunt v. Hunt (1861) 4 D. F. & J. 221, in which he followed Lord Cottenham’s decision in Wilson v. Wilson 1 H. L. C. 538, 550-553, 564, 565, where his argument for the respondent had prevailed. Full effect has therefore to be given in all courts to these contracts as to all other contracts. It seems not out of place to make this obvious reflection, for a perusal of some of the cases in the matrimonial courts seems to suggest that at times they are still looked at askance and enforced grudgingly. But there is no caste in contracts. Agreements for separation are formed, construed and dissolved and to be enforced on precisely the same principles as any respectable commercial agreement, of whose nature indeed they sometimes partake. As in other contracts stipulations will not be enforced which are illegal either as being opposed to positive law or public policy. But this is a common attribute of all contracts, though we may recognize that the subject-matter of separation agreements may bring them more than others into relation with questions of public policy.”	Radmacher formerly Granatino v Granatino

Lawyers have focussed on the scope of duty question since the decision of the House of Lords in SAAMCO but the question was not conjured up in that case and arises in a wider context. As Lord Sumption pointed out in Hughes-Holland , paras 21-24, it is an established principle that the law addresses the nature or extent of the duty of the defendant in determining the defendant’s liability for damage. Thus, in Roe v Minister of Health [1954] 2 QB 66 Denning LJ said that the questions of duty, causation and remoteness run continually into one another and continued (p 85): “It seems to me that they are simply three different ways of looking at one and the same problem. Starting with the proposition that a negligent person should be liable, within reason, for the consequences of his conduct, the extent of his liability is to be found by asking the one question: Is the consequence fairly to be regarded as within the risk created by the negligence? If so, the negligent person is liable for it: but otherwise not.” This emphasis on the consequence of the act or omission as an element in analysing the scope of duty owed by a defendant in tort informed the Privy Council’s approach in Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd (The Wagon Mound) [1961] AC 388 , in which Viscount Simonds, delivering the advice of the Board, stated (p 425): “It is, no doubt, proper when considering tortious liability for negligence to analyse its elements and to say that the plaintiff must prove a duty owed to him by the defendant, a breach of that duty by the defendant, and consequent damage. But there can be no liability until the damage has been done. It is not the act but the consequences on which tortious liability is founded. Just as (as it has been said) there is no such thing as negligence in the air, so there is no such thing as liability in the air … It is vain to isolate the liability from its context and to say that B is or is not liable, and then to ask for what damage he is liable. For his liability is in respect of that damage and no other.” Similarly, in Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman (1985) 157 CLR 424, 487, Brennan J stated: “It is impermissible to postulate a duty of care to avoid one kind of damage - say, personal injury - and, finding the defendant guilty of failing to discharge that duty, to hold him liable for the damage actually suffered that is of another and independent kind - say, economic loss. … The question is always whether the defendant was under a duty to avoid or prevent that damage, but the actual nature of the damage suffered is relevant to the existence and extent of any duty to avoid or prevent it.” The law has regard to the actual nature of the damage which the claimant has suffered when it determines the scope of the defendant’s duty. For example, where the damage which is the subject of a claim is pure economic loss which has been caused by a careless representation, the law has placed limits on the scope of the defendant’s duty by requiring that the defendant could reasonably have foreseen that the claimant would reasonably rely on the representation: Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465 ; Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605 (“Caparo”); NRAM Ltd (formerly NRAM plc) v Steel [2018] UKSC 13 ; [2018] 1 WLR 1190 ; 2018 SC (UKSC) 141. Similarly, limits have been imposed on the scope of a defendant’s duty to avoid causing psychiatric injury to secondary victims in an accident or disaster: McLoughlin v O’Brian [1983] 1 AC 410 ; Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [1992] 1 AC 310 ; Frost v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [1999] 2 AC 455 .

Khan v Meadows	1. The claimant, Lady Brownlie, is the widow of the distinguished international lawyer Sir Ian Brownlie QC. In January 2010, she and her husband were on holiday in Egypt, staying at the Four Seasons Hotel Cairo at Nile Plaza. Lady Brownlie’s evidence is that on a previous visit to the hotel, she had picked up a leaflet published by the hotel advertising safari tours which it provided. Before leaving England on the subsequent trip, she telephoned the hotel and booked with the concierge an excursion to Fayoum in a hired chauffeur-driven car. The excursion took place on 3 January, and ended in tragedy. The car left the road and crashed. The passengers, in addition to Sir Ian and Lady Brownlie, were his daughter Rebecca, and Rebecca’s two children. Sir Ian and Rebecca were killed. Lady Brownlie and the two children were seriously injured.	Four Seasons Holdings Incorporated v Brownlie	28. In our view, and as explained in more detail below, a helpful model for analysing the place of the scope of duty principle in the tort of negligence, and the role of the other ingredients upon which Mr Havers has relied in this context, consists of asking six questions in sequence. It is not an exclusive or comprehensive analysis, but it may bring some clarity to the role of the scope of duty principle which SAAMCO highlighted. Those questions are: (1) Is the harm (loss, injury and damage) which is the subject matter of the claim actionable in negligence? (the actionability question) (2) What are the risks of harm to the claimant against which the law imposes on the defendant a duty to take care? (the scope of duty question) (3) Did the defendant breach his or her duty by his or her act or omission? (the breach question) (4) Is the loss for which the claimant seeks damages the consequence of the defendant’s act or omission? (the factual causation question) (5) Is there a sufficient nexus between a particular element of the harm for which the claimant seeks damages and the subject matter of the defendant’s duty of care as analysed at stage 2 above? (the duty nexus question) (6) Is a particular element of the harm for which the claimant seeks damages irrecoverable because it is too remote, or because there is a different effective cause (including novus actus interveniens) in relation to it or because the claimant has mitigated his or her loss or has failed to avoid loss which he or she could reasonably have been expected to avoid? (the legal responsibility question) Application of this analysis gives the value of the claimant’s claim for damages in accordance with the principle that the law in awarding damages seeks, so far as money can, to place the claimant in the position he or she would have been in absent the defendant’s negligence.	Khan v Meadows	(6) Was the damage or loss within the scope of the duty of care? (the scope of duty question)	Khan v Meadows	39. It will be immediately apparent that child care law already protects the child who is injured in such circumstances. He has suffered significant harm attributable to the care given to him not being what it would be reasonable to expect a parent to give to him. As the Lancashire case [2002] 2 AC 147 made clear, it is not necessary to identify the perpetrator of the harm in order to cross the threshold. Furthermore, child care law will protect another child who is a member of the same household where the other child was injured.	In the matter of J Children	27. Mr Simeon Maskrey QC in seeking to uphold the judgment of the Court of Appeal began his able submission by setting the scope of duty question, which the House of Lords’ decision in SAAMCO has highlighted, in the context of the series of questions which one may ask when analysing whether a claimant is entitled to recover damages for loss caused by the tort of negligence. It was a helpful exercise. We will reformulate and expand upon his questions and carry out a similar exercise before explaining the various stages of, and the role of the scope of duty question in, that analysis.	Khan v Meadows	63. In many, and probably a large majority of, cases of clinical negligence the application of the scope of duty principle results in the conclusion that a type of loss or an element of a claimant’s loss is within the scope of the defendant’s duty, without the court having to address the SAAMCO counterfactual. Where a surgeon negligently performs an operation and causes both physical injury and consequent economic loss to the patient, both types of loss will normally be within the scope of the defendant’s duty of care. In other words, by undertaking the operation on the patient the surgeon takes responsibility for physical harm caused by any lack of skill and care in performing the operation and for consequential economic loss. Similarly, when a general medical practitioner negligently prescribes unsuitable medication, thereby causing injury or failing to prevent the development of an otherwise preventable medical condition, both the injury or condition and the consequential economic loss will generally be within the scope of the defendant’s duty. The negligent care of a mother in the final stages of pregnancy can sadly have the result of the birth of a baby with brain damage and the defendant is normally liable to pay compensation for both the injury and the consequential additional cost of caring for the disabled child. In the Parkinson and Groom cases the object of the service undertaken was to prevent the birth of any child as in each case the mother did not want to have any more children. In Parkinson the service undertaken was to prevent a pregnancy while in Groom the task which should have been performed was to make sure that the mother was not pregnant notwithstanding her recent sterilisation. In both cases the added economic costs of caring for a disabled child, whatever his or her disability, were within the scope of the defendant’s liability because of the nature of the service which the defendant had undertaken. In none of those cases did the SAAMCO counterfactual have a role to play. But it is necessary in every case to consider the nature of the service which the medical practitioner is providing in order to determine what are the risk or risks which the law imposes a duty on the medical practitioner to exercise reasonable care to avoid. That is the scope of duty question.	Khan v Meadows	24. It is clear that the components of the tort of negligence are interrelated and that there is no one generally accepted formula for analysing that interrelationship in a claim in negligence. Textbooks on negligence often identify four components or ingredients in the tort of negligence, namely, (i) the duty of care, (ii) its breach, (iii) causation of damage and (iv) the damage. For example, in Clerk and Lindsell on Torts , 23rd ed (2020), para 7-04, the authors list these ingredients as (1) the existence of a duty of care situation, (2) the breach of that duty by the defendant, (3) a causal connection between the defendant’s careless conduct and the damage and (4) the existence of a particular kind of damage to the particular claimant which is not so unforeseeable as to be too remote. The authors state: “There is no magic in the order as set out, nor should it be supposed that courts proceed from points (1) to (4) in sequence”. The authors of Winfield and Jolowicz on Tort , 20th ed (2020) suggest that the tort of negligence is constituted by those four elements which they place in order as (i) the duty of care, (ii) its breach, (iii) damage and (iv) causation (para 5-002). They point out that a given fact pattern can put several elements in issue simultaneously and that the elements are interlinked. They suggest that it is conventional for the courts to address the elements of the tort in sequence with the question of duty being a threshold question (para 5-007): “Taking the elements of the tort in this order can help judges to structure their decisions and to ensure that elements are not overlooked. Furthermore, the order in which the elements of the tort are considered is important because they form an integrated whole, in which one element can be defined and analysed only in terms of the other elements. For example, as questions of causation and remoteness concern the link between the breach of duty and the damage, it is important to look at fault and damage before looking at causation.” In relation to the third and fourth elements of this analysis (damage and causation) the authors suggest (para 7-001) that there are four distinct concepts of actionable damage, causation in fact, causation in law, and remoteness.	Khan v Meadows	18. The majority of the Court of Appeal (Simon LJ and the Chancellor) held that there was no arguable case that RDS owed the appellants a common law duty of care to protect them against foreseeable harm caused by the operations of SPDC. Sales LJ delivered a dissenting judgment in which he explained why he considered there was a good arguable case that RDS did owe the appellants a duty of care.	Okpabi and others v Royal Dutch Shell Plc and another	80. As this approach is relatively conventional, I do not think it is necessary to extend this judgment by explaining each of the seven questions. Suffice it to say that the duty of care concept controls the boundaries of the tort of negligence and problematic areas include pure economic loss, psychiatric illness and omissions; legal causation, as distinct from remoteness, is focusing on whether intervening acts of the claimant, or third parties, or natural events, break the chain of causation (so that the breach is no longer an effective cause); the SAAMCO principle as to whether the loss was within the scope of the duty of care falls to be considered as the sixth question; and defences include contributory negligence (which is a partial defence), voluntary acceptance of risk, illegality and limitation of actions. Questions (4)-(6) are closely related because they are all concerned with limitations on the recovery of factually caused loss: although generally regarded as different from each other, the same result may be reached by applying more than one of those three limitations (and, depending on the facts, the order in which one considers them may be largely a matter of convenience). I would add that what Lord Hodge and Lord Sales appear to treat as their first question - often labelled the question of “minimum actionable damage” (see Jane Stapleton, “The Gist of Negligence” (1988) 104 LQR 213) - can, in my view, be conveniently treated as a sub-issue under the duty of care enquiry (my first question).

Lastly, there are the questions about relief under section 727 CA 1985 . There are two points. First, there is the decision by the deputy judge that Mr Holland was entitled to a few days grace after the events of 18 August 2004 to enable him to take stock. Rimer LJ thought the deputy judge was in error in giving Mr Holland this grace period: para 88. He said that Mr Holland had not conducted himself so as to deserve it and that there was no factual basis for the decision. Here too Elias LJ, para 128, and Ward LJ, para 138, disagreed. Elias LJ said that there was evidence justifying the deputy judge’s analysis. I respectfully agree with the majority on this point too. It seems to me that the judge provided a sufficient explanation for his decision in paras 269-270, and that his was a decision with which an appellate court could not properly interfere.	Holland v The Commissioners for Her Majestys Revenue and Customs and another	148. A specific example of a case in which a duty of care may arise regardless of the exercise of control is provided by what the appellants have described as Vedanta route (4). This is based on what Lord Briggs stated at para 53:	Okpabi and others v Royal Dutch Shell Plc and another	120. Lord Steyn’s position was a little different. At para 51, he referred to the fact that it would be necessary to take into account the fact that inquests were dealt with by statute. However, he considered that it was inappropriate for the common law to extend the law on investigating suspicious deaths given that “the right to life is comprehensively protected under article 2 … as incorporated in our law by the 1998 Act ”. However, he did then suggest that “[t]he impact of evolving customary international law on our domestic legal system is a subject of increasing importance”.	Keyu and others v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and another	270. One can quite understand how it would be inapt to construct a common law duty to investigate which was, in effect, parallel to the statutory obligation to investigate suspicious deaths occurring within the national court’s jurisdiction. But suppose that the deaths had occurred at a time when the United Kingdom had jurisdiction over the territory in which they had occurred but, at that time, there was no article 2 duty to investigate nor, when an inquest was subsequently sought, was there any statutory requirement to investigate the deaths because, for instance, United Kingdom had by then relinquished jurisdiction over the country in which they had occurred. If there was a duty to investigate under customary international law, which was current at the time that the deaths occurred, it seems to me that there would be a strong argument that such a duty should find expression in the common law. But those supposed facts are far removed from the circumstances of the present case and I need say nothing further about the matter.	Keyu and others v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and another	269. I would be less sanguine about accepting in its entirety Lord Neuberger’s second reason for rejecting the appellants’ case on this ground. He relies strongly on four of the five opinions in the House of Lords in McKerr to support his conclusion that a rule of customary international law which decreed that deaths occurring as long ago as 1948 should be investigated ought not to be incorporated into the common law. The basis on which those opinions were expressed is that it would be inappropriate to do so where, in the words of Lord Nicholls, this would “create an overriding common law obligation on the state, corresponding to article 2 … in an area of the law for which Parliament has long legislated”.	Keyu and others v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and another	26. The appellants’ legal argument has accordingly been recast in the light of Vedanta . It is now contended that a duty of care arises by what they describe as Vedanta routes (1) to (4), namely:	Okpabi and others v Royal Dutch Shell Plc and another	74. We have the benefit of Lord Neuberger’s discussion, in Daejan , of the imposition of a costs condition, at [59]-[64]. In the context of the present case it seems to me that there are two important points to be made, in relation to this discussion. (1) It seems clear to me that Lord Neuberger was not seeking to lay down any hard and fast rules on the imposition of a costs condition. One size does not fit all. It is clear that the question of whether a costs condition should be imposed takes one back to what Lord Neuberger said at [54]. A costs condition could be imposed if the tribunal thought that such a condition was appropriate in its nature and effect. Putting the matter another way, the tribunal could impose a costs condition on the basis that it would not be reasonable to dispense with the consultation requirements in the absence of the costs condition; see Lord Neuberger at [61]. (2) The analogy with relief from forfeiture was appropriate in Daejan . The analogy does not seem to me to have been intended to be applicable in every case. The reason for this is obvious. A tenant who requires relief from forfeiture is, necessarily, a tenant who has breached a covenant or covenants in his lease. As such, the tenant requires the indulgence of the court, in the grant of relief from forfeiture. More simply, the tenant is the party in default. As such, it is not unreasonable that the tenant should have to pay the landlord’s costs of responding to the application for relief from forfeiture, so far as reasonably incurred. In Daejan the landlord was clearly the party in default, seeking the indulgence of the tribunal. As such, it was not unreasonable that the landlord should be treated as being in the same position as a defaulting tenant seeking relief from forfeiture. In the present case, and on the findings of the FTT, the Appellant was in a materially different position. The Appellant was not seeking to avoid its responsibilities to leaseholders. To the contrary, and as the FTT found, the Appellant was “seeking to ensure that an unsafe building is made safe as quickly as possible” . On these facts it seems to me that the analogy with a tenant seeking relief from forfeiture is not necessarily apposite. Nor does it seem to me that Lord Neuberger intended the analogy to be apposite and/or binding in all cases.	Adriatic Land 5 Limited v The Long Leaseholders at Hippersley Point	118. This conclusion receives strong support from four of the five opinions given in McKerr , whose authority on this point has in no way been diminished by any of the judgments in McCaughey. At para 30, Lord Nicholls, with whom Lord Rodger agreed, said that he had “grave reservations about the appropriateness of the common law now fashioning a free-standing positive obligation of this far-reaching character”, namely “a common law obligation to arrange for an effective investigation into [a suspicious] death”, simply because it was required by article 2. However, he specifically rejected the notion of such a common law obligation on the ground that it “would create an overriding common law obligation on the state, corresponding to article 2 … in an area of the law for which Parliament has long legislated”, namely coroners’ inquests.

Tribunal	Majority	Norris v A.G. [1983] IESC 3.xml	Middle	Of the ten witnesses called for the plaintiff, I leave out of consideration the plaintiff and Edmund Lynch, the research director of the National Gay Federation, on the ground that their opinions represent a vested interest in the outcome of this case.	Of the two Irish psychiatrists who were called as witnesses, Dr. McCracken confined his evidence to the advice he had given to the plaintiff as his pat ient; that advice being that the plaintiff should consider emigrating to a country where laxer laws dealing with homosexual acts would be more conducive to his psychological and mental well-being. The other Irish psychiatrist, Professor Ivor Browne, the c h ief psychiatrist to the Eastern Health Board, gave it as his considered opinion, from a study of the psychiatric problems of confirmed and exclusively homosexual men, that the impugned statutory provisions exacerbate their fears, their loneliness, their s e nse of alienation and the feelings of emotional and physical deprivation from which they suffer if they seek to conform to the existing restrictions of the criminal law; and that attempts to prohibit or divert the pursuit of their instinctive and inescapa b le sexual urges by means of legal constraints or psycho-therapeutical methods, are undesirable, counterproductive and tend to produce a furtive way of life which may explain, at least in part, the high incidence of venereal diseases among male homosexuals .  His experience in England was that the relaxation of the criminal restrictions on homosexual acts between consenting adult males, as effected by the Sexual Offences Act, 1967, cannot be proved to have caused a deterioration of general moral standards or  to have resulted in any increase in the prevalence of homosexuality.	A Mrs. Robertson, who in 1970 formed in England an organisation called Parents Inquiry, designed to enable young homosexual men to come to terms with their families about their homosexua lity, gave it as her opinion that, while there are differing Christian views of the morality of homosexual acts, it is desirable that those compulsively drawn by their sexual orientation to such acts should not be criminally or morally condemned, but shou l d be given such counselling and other services as will enable them to come to reasonable terms with their families and with society generally: an achievement which, in her opinion, is made particularly difficult in this State because of the harshness of t he criminal law.	0.4249	0.2642	0.4249, 0.3909, 0.3896, 0.3859, 0.3812, 0.3794, 0.3721, 0.3554, 0.3523, 0.3410	56. Mr Lawrence could produce no empirical evidence to support this thesis, nor could Mr Ter Haar produce any empirical evidence to disprove it. Research into the position in other common law jurisdictions was inconclusive. As expert witnesses have, to date, had the benefit of immunity, how they will behave if that immunity is removed must be a matter of conjecture or, more accurately, reasoning. But if reasoning is applied, I do not find that it supports Mr Lawrence’s thesis. An expert’s initial advice is likely to be for the benefit of his client alone. It is on the basis of that advice that the client is likely to decide whether to proceed with his claim, or the terms on which to settle it. The question then arises of the expert’s attitude if he subsequently forms the view, or is persuaded by the witness on the other side, that his initial advice was over-optimistic, or that there is some weakness in his client’s case which he had not appreciated. His duty to the court is frankly to concede his change of view. The witness of integrity will do so. I can readily appreciate the possibility that some experts may not have that integrity. They will be reluctant to admit to the weakness in their client’s case. They may be reluctant because of loyalty to the client and his team, or because of a disinclination to admit to having erred in the initial opinion. I question, however, whether their reluctance will be because of a fear of being sued – at least a fear of being sued for the opinion given to the court. An expert will be well aware of his duty to the court and that if he frankly accepts that he has changed his view it will be apparent that he is performing that duty. I do not see why he should be concerned that this will result in his being sued for breach of duty. It is paradoxical to postulate that in order to persuade an expert to perform the duty that he has undertaken to his client it is necessary to give him immunity from liability for breach of that duty.

Jones v Kaney	83. Any suggestion of a potentially unsatisfactory chilling effect on expert witnesses is inconsistent with the liability to a prosecution for perjury for untruthful evidence and with liability to disciplinary proceedings for unprofessional conduct in the preparation or presentation of expert evidence. The immunity has never prevented the possibility of prosecution for perjury of an expert witness who deliberately misleads the court although it would of course be very difficult to prove its elements. As Sir George Jessel MR said in Lord Abinger v Ashton (1873) 17 LR Eq 358, 373-374: “in matters of opinion I very much distrust expert evidence, for several reasons. …[A]lthough the evidence is given on oath, in point of fact the person knows he cannot be indicted for perjury, because it is only evidence as to a matter of opinion. So that you have not the authority of legal sanction. A dishonest man, knowing that he could not be punished, might be inclined to indulge in extravagant assertions on an occasion that required it.”	Jones v Kaney	173. The lack of a secure principled basis for removing the immunity from expert witnesses, the lack of a clear dividing line between what is to be affected by the removal and what is not, the uncertainties that this would cause and the lack of reliable evidence to indicate what the effects might be suggest that the wiser course would be to leave matters as they stand. The Law Commission has recently completed a project in which it addressed the admissibility of expert evidence in criminal proceedings in England and Wales: see Law Com No 325 (HC 829, 21 March 2011). The question of immunity was not raised at any stage during its consideration of this issue. If there is a need to reform the law in this area, it would be better to leave it to be dealt with by Parliament following a further report by the Law Commission. As Watson v M’Ewan [1905] AC 480 remains binding in Scotland and witness immunity in Scotland is a devolved matter, the question whether it is in need of reform deserves attention by the Scottish Law Commission as soon as practicable. In this way all the various problems could be addressed after proper consultation and debate.	Jones v Kaney	4. One important development was the influence of the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly after it was given effect in domestic law by the Scotland Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998 . In particular, the Convention necessitated a more robust system of judicial protection of the rights of patients than had previously existed, and greater involvement of patients and their families and carers in decisions concerning treatment. Another important development concerned the treatment of the mentally ill, with many more patients being treated outside hospitals, fewer patients requiring long-term hospital care, and a marked reduction in the number of hospital beds available for the treatment of mental illness. A third development was an increasing recognition of the desirability of eliminating the stigma which had long been associated with mental illness. All these developments, and others, necessitated a fundamental review of Scottish mental health law.	G v Scottish Ministers and another Scotland	63. Fifth, contrary to the Judge’s view, the reading in of the words proposed by Ms Braganza would not undermine combat effectiveness, which was the rationale for Article 3.4 of the Framework Directive as identified in Recital 19. This is the MOD’s own view, as reflected in its policy statements referred to above. There is no correlation between combat effectiveness and excluding Mr L from service in the armed forces. He had no detectable virus and was assessed to pose no risk to others by medical specialists. Many soldiers remain in service with limited ability to deploy, particularly if there is a good chance of improvement, as there was in Mr L’s cases. Moreover, the MOD’s disclosure shows that, far from equal treatment threatening combat effectiveness, the stigmatising of HIV is likely to deter service personnel from seeking diagnosis and treatment and thereby increase risk. These considerations had driven the MOD’s change in policy in relation to HIV.	L  Anor v Ministry of Defence	35. In the light of the above, I consider that the Court of Appeal focused too narrowly on the disclosures already made on the internet, and did not give due weight to the qualitative difference in intrusiveness and distress likely to be involved in what is now proposed by way of unrestricted publication by the English media in hard copy as well as on their own internet sites. There is little doubt that there would be a media storm. It would involve not merely disclosure of names and generalised description of the nature of the sexual activities involved, but the most intimate details. This would be likely to add greatly and on a potentially enduring basis to the intrusiveness and distress felt by the appellant, his partner and, by way of increased media attention now and/or in the future, their children. The Court of Appeal did not do justice to this qualitative difference either when it said that the “wall-to-wall excoriation which the claimant fears has already been taking place for the last two weeks in the English press”, as a result of “numerous headlines such as ‘celebrity love cheat’ and ‘Gag couple alleged to have had a threesome’” (para 47(ii), or when it went on to refer to the likely impact of the proposed publication as “a further unwelcome intrusion”, increasing what is being suffered already, not “a shock revelation, as publication in January would have been” (para 47(iii)).	PJS v News Group Newspapers Ltd	75. Although these are, of course, Scottish references and, rather to my regret, we have not had the benefit of any intervention on behalf of English and Welsh prosecuting authorities to assist us as to the legal position south of the border, I cannot but notice that on their face the statutory provisions governing the position in England and Wales sit a little uneasily even with the absolute rule in Cadder , let alone with the substantial extension to that rule now proposed by the respective accused in these references.	Ambrose v Harris Procurator Fiscal Oban Scotland	188. These demarcation problems might have to be suffered if it were clear that the benefits of making the exception outweighed the risks. But it is impossible to say what effect the removal of immunity will have, either on the care with which the experts give their evidence, or upon their willingness to do so. It is certainly possible that it will reduce any tendency to act as a “hired gun” and that would be a very good thing; but it is also possible that it will increase the pressure on an expert to stick to her previous opinion for fear of being sued if she retracts or modifies it. It is possible that it will have no effect at all upon the willingness of experts to give evidence; it is also possible that, in certain fields at least, it will reduce their willingness to do so, or even to become involved in the particular field of practice at all. It is possible that professional indemnity insurance premiums will rise and that fees for giving expert evidence will also rise to take account of this; it is possible that exclusion clauses may be introduced into contracts to give expert evidence, in which case we shall be back where we started.	Jones v Kaney	168. Chilling effect on the availability of witnesses . Mr Lawrence QC for the respondent said that it was a relevant consideration whether abolition of the immunity would deter a significant number of potential experts from giving evidence. Otton LJ made this point in Stanton v Callaghan [2000] QB 75 , 106 and Thorpe LJ raised the same concern in Meadow v General Medical Council [2006] EWCA Civ 1390 , [2007] QB 462 , para 227. I would not, on present information, attach much importance to this argument. In any event, without hard information, it is not possible to assess how much weight should be given to it. Experts can usually expect to be paid for their work, and there are no doubt other considerations that will incline them to continue to make themselves available. I would not, however, discard this point as entirely irrelevant. There may be some situations – some kind of case, some kinds of client – where the expert would be reluctant to become involved at all. If that were to happen it would raise questions as to whether access to justice for the disadvantaged was being inhibited. This is a reason for wishing to be cautious before taking a step which, for all practical purposes, would be irretrievable.	Jones v Kaney	93. I would have no hesitation in rejecting that suggestion firstly because it would be a wholly retrograde step and would involve reversing well established authority to contrary effect. More importantly, however, there is no evidence that witnesses would react in this way in anticipation of possible proceedings by disappointed clients. In particular, there is nothing to support the assumption that conscientious witnesses (which, if assumptions are to be made at all, professional witnesses must be presumed to be) would behave discreditably by modifying their opinions from those they truly held because they feared that an aggrieved client might unwarrantably seek redress against them. If an expert expresses an honestly held view, even if it differs from that which he may have originally expressed, provided it is an opinion which is tenable, he has nothing to fear from a disgruntled party.

[1983] IESC 3.xml	End	The Constitution rejected the English common-law view of the position of the illegitimate child in so far as its fundamental rights are concerned. It guarantees to protect the child  s natural rights in the same way as it guarantees to protect the natural rights of the mother of the child.	For myself I am content to say that the provisions of the preamble, which I have quoted earlier in this judgment, wou ld appear to lean heavily against any view other than that the right to life of the unborn child is a sacred trust to which all the organs of government must lend their support. The right of the adult male citizen  privately to express his sexual orientation alone or with another such person free from State interference is an entirely different matter.	The plaintiff has, further, rested his case upon alleged breach of the constitutional guarantee of equality contained in s. 1 of Article 40. Having reached  the conclusion already expressed, I do not consider it necessary to examine the law in the light of that section. However, I am not to be taken as agreeing with the view that the plaintiff  s argument implies an over-wide interpretation of the scope of that  constitutional guarantee. Likewise, in so far as the plaintiff has rested his case upon article 8 of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the   Dudgeon Case , I do not consider it necessary to come to any conclusion in that regard. Apart from the limited issue of locus standi,   my judgment depends upon the right of privacy derived from Article 40, as I have sought to explain. It may be, as some of the theological w itnesses claimed, that the criminalisation of the sexual acts proscribed by the impugned sections is contrary to the law of God; I am content to hold that it is contrary to one of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.	0.6126	0.464	0.6126, 0.5726, 0.5703, 0.5427, 0.5368, 0.5277, 0.5212, 0.5193, 0.5147, 0.5096	14. The reference in the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 shows that counteracting discrimination was a fundamental purpose of the Convention. Article 2 states: “Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.” Lord Steyn emphasised this point in Islam v Secretary of State for the Home Department; R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal, Ex p Shah [1999] 2 AC 629, 639. He also drew attention to the first preamble to the Declaration, which proclaimed the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. No mention is made of sexual orientation in the preamble or any of its articles, nor is sexual orientation mentioned in article 1A(2) of the Convention. But coupled with an increasing recognition of the rights of gay people since the early 1960s has come an appreciation of the fundamental importance of their not being discriminated against in any respect that affects their core identity as homosexuals. They are as much entitled to freedom of association with others of the same sexual orientation, and to freedom of self-expression in matters that affect their sexuality, as people who are straight.

HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	52. Sexual orientation is a core component of a person’s identity which requires fulfilment through relationships with others of the same orientation. As Justice Sachs of the South African Constitutional Court movingly put it in National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice , 1999 (1) SA 6, para 117: “While recognising the unique worth of each person, the Constitution does not presuppose that a holder of rights is an isolated, lonely and abstract figure possessing a disembodied and socially disconnected self. It acknowledges that people live in their bodies, their communities, their cultures, their places and their times. The expression of sexuality requires a partner, real or imagined.”	Bull and another v Hall and another	348. In response, the European Court of Human Rights referred to its previous case law finding that the protection afforded under Irish law to the right to life of the unborn was based on profound moral values concerning the nature of life. It referred to its finding in Vo v France (2004) 40 EHRR 12 that it was neither desirable nor possible to answer the question of whether the unborn was a person for the purposes of article 2 of the Convention, so that it would be equally legitimate for a state to choose to consider the unborn to be such a person and to aim to protect that life. In relation to the balancing exercise required by article 8, the court observed that “the state authorities are, in principle, in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion, not only on the exact content of the requirements of morals in their country, but also on the necessity of a restriction intended to meet them” (para 232). It continued:	In the matter of an application by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for Judicial Review	11. The group is defined by the immutable characteristic of its members’ sexual orientation or sexuality. This is a characteristic that may be revealed, to a greater or lesser degree, by the way the members of this group behave. In that sense, because it manifests itself in behaviour, it is less immediately visible than a person’s race. But, unlike a person’s religion or political opinion, it is incapable of being changed. To pretend that it does not exist, or that the behaviour by which it manifests itself can be suppressed, is to deny the members of this group their fundamental right to be what they are – of the right to do simple, everyday things with others of the same orientation such as living or spending time together or expressing their affection for each other in public.	HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	275. The case made by the Attorney General appears to depart from the Court of Appeal’s understanding of the legitimate aim and to assign an inherent and fundamental value to the life of the unborn child. At para 81 of his printed case, the Attorney makes this claim:	In the matter of an application by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for Judicial Review	94. The European Court of Human Rights has also taken a somewhat more nuanced approach. Vo v France (2004) 40 EHRR 12 was concerned with a case where a doctor by negligence had caused the termination of a pregnancy at the 20 to 24 weeks stage. The doctor had been acquitted of causing unintentional harm on the ground that the foetus was not at that stage a person. Complaint was made that this involved a breach of article 2. The European Court of Human Rights after considering the previous case law said that, in the circumstances examined to date, under various national laws on abortion, the unborn child is not regarded as a person, directly protected by article 2. However, it went on to leave open the possibility that in certain circumstances certain safeguards might be extended to the unborn child (para 80). In the context of the new situation before it, no single answer could be given to the question when life begins and who is a “person”. The question was within each state’s margin of appreciation (para 82). But, so far as there was a consensus, it was only that the foetus/embryo belonged to the human race and had the potential to develop into a full person (para 84). In A, B and C v Ireland (2010) 53 EHRR 13 , the issue was whether the Irish prohibition on abortion was compatible with the Convention. The prohibition applied save where necessary to save the mother’s life, so obliging pregnant mothers fearing for their health or well-being if their pregnancy continued to travel to England for an abortion. The Court at para 213 referred to Vo v France in support of a dictum that “the woman’s right to respect for her private life must be weighed against other competing rights and freedoms involved including those of the unborn child”. That is a more open-ended proposition, but at para 222 the Court repeated that it had been “confirmed by the Court’s finding in ... Vo v France … that it was neither desirable nor possible to answer the question of whether the unborn was a person for the purposes of article 2 of the Convention”. In the light of this and of the Court’s case law generally, the Court cannot in para 213 be read as equating the interests of an unborn child with those of the mother in the context of abortion.

Heterosexuals have known this about themselves and been able to fulfil themselves in this way throughout history. Homosexuals have also known this about themselves but were long denied the possibility of fulfilling themselves through relationships with others. This was an affront to their dignity as human beings which our law has now (some would say belatedly) recognised. Homosexuals can enjoy the same freedom and the same relationships as any others. But we should not underestimate the continuing legacy of those centuries of discrimination, persecution even, which is still going on in many parts of the world. It is no doubt for that reason that Strasbourg requires “very weighty reasons” to justify discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. It is for that reason that we should be slow to accept that prohibiting hotel keepers from discriminating against homosexuals is a disproportionate limitation on their right to manifest their religion.	Bull and another v Hall and another	76. The New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority observed in Re GJ [1998] (1995) INLR 387, 420 that “sexual orientation is either an innate or unchangeable characteristic or a characteristic so fundamental to identity or human dignity that it ought not be required to be changed” (emphasis in the original). So, starting from that position, the Convention offers protection to gay and lesbian people – and, I would add, bisexuals and everyone else on a broad spectrum of sexual behaviour - because they are entitled to have the same freedom from fear of persecution as their straight counterparts. No-one would proceed on the basis that a straight man or woman could find it reasonably tolerable to conceal his or her sexual identity indefinitely to avoid suffering persecution. Nor would anyone proceed on the basis that a man or woman could find it reasonably tolerable to conceal his or her race indefinitely to avoid suffering persecution. Such an assumption about gay men and lesbian women is equally unacceptable. Most significantly, it is unacceptable as being inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the Convention since it involves the applicant denying or hiding precisely the innate characteristic which forms the basis of his claim of persecution: Atta Fosu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2008 FC 1135, para 17, per Zinn J.	HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	303. The Department of Justice has drawn attention to the observations of the Grand Chamber in Vo to the effect that there was no consensus among European states as to when life begins and suggests that, in effect, this is what NIHRC invites this court to recognise. Mr McGleenan also argues that since the Strasbourg court has “not moved to exclude prenatal life”, this court should find that article 2 extends to protect “the human rights of the most vulnerable”. He claims that a finding that article 2 did not extend protections to prenatal life would go against the very grain of the Convention.

On the substantive compatibility issues, a majority - Lord Mance, Lord Kerr, Lord Wilson and I - hold that the current law is incompatible with the right to respect for private and family life, guaranteed by article 8 of the Convention, insofar as it prohibits abortion in cases of rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormality. Lady Black agrees with that holding in the case of fatal foetal abnormality. Lord Kerr and Lord Wilson also hold that it is incompatible with the right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, guaranteed by article 3 of the Convention. Lord Reed and Lord Lloyd-Jones hold that the law is not incompatible with either article 8 or article 3.
