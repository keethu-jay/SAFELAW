Dr Nadarajah did not believe that the rehabilitation programme had run its course.	KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT	78. The GMC’s 2010 guide to good practice draws upon the domestic and European jurisprudence and covers the matters that one would therefore expect. I will not rehearse all those matters here, particularly given that guidance is continuing to evolve, and will simply give a broad indication of the nature and ambit of the document. It provides the doctor with a decision-making model, applicable where an adult lacks the capacity to decide about treatment and care. As part of the decision-making process, the doctor is to:	An NHS Trust and others v Y by his litigation friend the Official Solicitor and another	45. Unfortunately, Dr Thrift was of the view that no change was possible without an increase in JB’s motivation. Dr Peters stated that JB’s “lack of insight into his risks and refusal to accept any wrongdoing or need to change indicates that he is not ready to undertake treatment at this stage”. She considered that JB’s lack of recognition that his behaviour was a problem is a “barrier to accessing any therapeutic input” and that she was unaware of any “stand-alone treatment method used to increase motivation”.	A Local Authority v JB	66. The situation of the defendant is deeply tragic. The evidence is that he is highly intelligent and gifted but that his disorder has disabled him from engaging in the therapy which he needs and from cooperating with many of those, particularly of those in authority, who seek to help him. Attempts to improve his situation are therefore locked. Sadly the law can do little to unlock them. But he has the support of a close friend and advocate; of Mr Callow, a distinguished chartered psychologist; and of the inestimable Shelter, which represents him. Granted also what appears to be the continued goodwill of the local housing authority (“Mendip”) and its acceptance that, even if the defendant’s appeal were dismissed, it would nevertheless owe him the limited duties set out in section 190(2) of the 1996 Act , there is some hope that, between them, they can spark a positive response within the defendant.	AkermanLivingstone v Aster Communities Limited	81. She confirmed that she had never been arrested and was not aware of there being a warrant for her arrest, that she had been sacked from her employment. Her employer made no attempt to try and contact her although they had contacted her father. That was on one occasion in 2010. It was suggested to her that in March 2011 she wanted to stay in the United Kingdom to complete her education. She had contacted Leeds University and they had offered her a partial scholarship but that was not enough to support her. She replied that she did not have any choice.	AB v Secretary of State for the Home Department	30. In relation to the doors of the student services area in the Catalyst Building, Mr Maini-Thompson in his skeleton pointed to the findings of fact about this aspect. We note that, in the course of those findings, the tribunal found that the doors were large and heavy; and it appears to have accepted that the claimant, as a wheelchair user, could not physically open them unaided. The tribunal also found that the claimant did not complain about the matter until 20 September 2018, at which point it was immediately arranged that the doors would be kept open during her shifts. It also found that upon further investigation it was concluded that for structural reasons automatic openers and closers could not be fitted to these particular doors. There are findings elsewhere in the decision about the new building having been designed with insufficient thought for the needs of wheelchair users.	Edge Hill University v E Glasby	146. Failing to provide the Claimant with any meaningful work on her return or access to the First Respondent’s systems	Blackdown Hill Management Limited  Anor v Anastasia Tuchkova	15. During that period of absence, student services had moved into a new building called the Catalyst Building. On 20 September 2018 the claimant communicated to Mr Jones that she was finding the doors to the student services section of the new building too heavy to open on her own. The tribunal found that, upon being told this, Mr Jones immediately arranged for those doors to be kept open during the hours each day that the claimant did that job, pending, as he envisaged, an automated control being fitted. However, there was then a specific occasion, which it appears was later in September, when the claimant arrived early for her shift and was unable to gain entry to the section until someone came and let her in.	Edge Hill University v E Glasby	15. Later the respondent was to give the following evidence, which Hogg J accepted, about the circumstances of herself and B in Pakistan in the weeks following their arrival on 4 February 2014:	In the matter of B A child

The speeches in Cave are inconsistent with the proposition that section 32(2) applies where a defendant is aware only of a risk that what he is doing may be a breach of duty. The inescapable implication is that recklessness is insufficient. (Canada Square Operations Ltd v Potter)	125. The speeches in Cave are inconsistent with the proposition that section 32(2) applies where a defendant is aware only of a risk that what he is doing may be a breach of duty. The inescapable implication is that recklessness is insufficient.	Canada Square Operations Ltd v Potter	12. In the statement of facts and issues the parties agreed that it was “reasonably foreseeable that as a consequence of [Dr Khan’s] breach of duty, the appellant could give birth to a child that suffered from a condition such as autism as well as haemophilia”.	Khan v Meadows	35. As Lord Sumption has recently explained in Hughes-Holland , this principle was developed by the House of Lords in a series of cases concerning the negligent valuation of property following the property crash in the early 1990s: SAAMCO , Nykredit Mortgage Bank plc v Edward Erdman Group Ltd (formerly Edward Erdman (an unlimited company) (No 2) [1997] 1 WLR 1627 (“ Nykredit ”) and Platform Home Loans Ltd v Oyston Shipways Ltd [2000] 2 AC 190 (“ Platform Home Loans ”). The principle was applied by this court in relation to negligent misstatements by a solicitor in Hughes-Holland , and it was recognised by the Court of Appeal in the context of a medical negligence claim in Parkinson (above).	Khan v Meadows	620. Before addressing the evidence on the nature and extent of RS’ activities, it is important to establish her mental health circumstances. There is no dispute as to the medical evidence provided by, in particular, Dr Brady. In light of this, we accept her diagnoses and find that RS is currently suffering from the following conditions: i. severe PTSD; ii. severe depression; iii. schizoaffective disorder, currently in partial remission.	KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT	18. The claim has been rejected in all three courts below. But numerous different reasons have been given for this result, most of which are, we think, clearly inconsistent with the basic legal principles applicable to claims in the tort of negligence arising out of damage to tangible property. It is helpful to start by recalling three well-established principles.	Armstead v Royal  Sun Alliance Insurance Company Ltd	23. Where it is shown that loss has (factually) been caused by the defendant’s breach of a duty of care, five principles are capable of limiting the damages recoverable by the claimant. They are: (i) the scope of the duty; (ii) remoteness; (iii) intervening cause; (iv) failure to mitigate; and (v) contributory negligence. Although RSA has raised the first four of these principles as further reasons (ie over and above no duty of care being owed in respect of pure economic loss) why the clause 16 sum cannot be recovered, as we shall explain below the real issue concerns remoteness.	Armstead v Royal  Sun Alliance Insurance Company Ltd	83. Instead of obtaining e.g. a psychologist’s report, the Claimant sought to rely upon an article written by psychiatrists as to the pathological effects of significant humiliation upon a person’s mental health. For reasons already discussed under Ground 4, such generalised material is unlikely to be of assistance as it says nothing about the Claimant’s own state.	AB v CD Ltd	68. Thirdly, Dr Khan was in breach of her duty of reasonable care, as she readily admitted. Fourthly, as a matter of factual causation, Ms Meadows lost the opportunity to terminate the pregnancy in which the child had both haemophilia and autism. There was thus a causal link between Dr Khan’s mistake and the birth of A. But that is not relevant to the scope of Dr Khan’s duty. In this case, fifthly, the answer to the scope of duty question points to a straightforward answer to the duty nexus question: the law did not impose on Dr Khan any duty in relation to unrelated risks which might arise in any pregnancy. It follows that Dr Khan is liable only for the costs associated with the care of A insofar as they are caused by his haemophilia. One can also apply the SAAMCO counterfactual as an analytical tool by asking what the outcome would have been if Dr Khan’s advice had been correct and Ms Meadows had not been a carrier of the haemophilia gene. The undisputed answer is that A would have been born with autism. Sixthly, given the purpose for which the service was undertaken by Dr Khan, and there being no questions of remoteness of loss, other effective cause or mitigation of loss, the law imposes upon her responsibility for the foreseeable consequences of the birth of a boy with haemophilia, and in particular the increased cost of caring for a child with haemophilia.	Khan v Meadows	190. Considering more precisely the point in time at which a claimant acquires “knowledge” for the purposes of sections 11(4) and 14(1) of the 1980 Act , the majority of the court in AB v Ministry of Defence endorsed the test earlier approved by the House of Lords in relation to claims falling under section 14A (inserted by the Latent Damage Act 1977), which applies to actions for damages for negligence, other than those involving personal injuries. In Haward v Fawcetts [2006] UKHL 9 ; [2006] 1 WLR 682 , para 9, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead stated:	Test Claimants in the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation and others v Commissioners for Her	14. In her judgment ( [2017] EWHC 2990 (QB) ; [2018] 4 WLR 8), Yip J described the legal issue which she had to address in these terms (para 2): “Can a mother who consults a doctor with a view to avoiding the birth of a child with a particular disability (rather than to avoid the birth of any child) recover damages for the additional costs associated with an unrelated disability?” She answered that question in the affirmative and awarded the appellant £9m inclusive of interest. Much of the debate before Yip J concerned two judgments of the Court of Appeal: Parkinson v St James and Seacroft University Hospital NHS Trust [2001] EWCA Civ 530 ; [2002] QB 266 (“ Parkinson ”) and Groom v Selby [2001] EWCA Civ 1522 ; [2002] Lloyd’s Rep Med 1 (“ Groom ”). In the first case, Mrs Parkinson became pregnant following a failed sterilisation. Her son was born with severe disabilities which were not connected to the sterilisation. In the second case, Mrs Groom underwent a sterilisation operation at a time when unknown to anyone she was about six days pregnant. Shortly afterwards, she consulted her general practitioner who failed to arrange a pregnancy test or examine her to see if she was pregnant. By the time she discovered her pregnancy, she did not wish to have a termination, but she would have terminated the pregnancy if informed sooner. She later gave birth to a child with salmonella meningitis resulting in severe disability. In each case, there was no direct connection between the negligence of the medical practitioner and the disability. In the first case the source of the child’s disability was genetic and in the second the disability arose from exposure to a bacterium during the process of her birth. In each case, the mother had not wanted to have any further children and she sought the services of the defendants for that purpose.	Khan v Meadows

The appellant suffered significant physical injuries, but these were not of such severity as to dwarf the significance of the psychiatric consequences of his accident. These were post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, an adjustment disorder and associated illness behaviour which manifested itself in chronic pain syndrome. (Jones v Kaney)	5. The appellant suffered significant physical injuries, but these were not of such severity as to dwarf the significance of the psychiatric consequences of his accident. These were post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, an adjustment disorder and associated illness behaviour which manifested itself in chronic pain syndrome.	Jones v Kaney	11.15 The Tribunal also notes that the Claimant has not provided us with any evidence that her illness continued to render her unable to work from around August 2019 onwards. On her visit to her GP in July 2019, her mood was: “stable” and that anxiety and depression was: “under control” (page 92R).	A  Anor v C Limited  Ors	(d) The appellant’s wife was diagnosed with depression and was prescribed medication.	Alban Velaj v The Secretary of State for the Home Department	24. In May 2020, the claimant asserted that SB should be receiving her full salary. The respondent suggested that if SB was able to return to work five days per week, she would be put back on to a full salary.	Artem Limited v K Edwins	11.8 The original reason for her absence from work was stated as being PTSD.	A  Anor v C Limited  Ors	39. Ms Egan submitted that the remedy findings were perverse, in particular, because the Dr Watts report made clear that, prior to the assault, it was the bereavement that had been sole source of the claimant’s anxiety. The report, and the tribunal’s liability decision, then considered the additional anxiety and PTSD caused by the stranger assault. The findings in the remedy decision were contrary to those earlier findings, as to the particular sources of her anxiety.	Edenbeck Limited v E Stevenson	i) he had held that the award should, in the light of the long estrangement and Mrs Ilott’s independent life and lack of expectation of benefit, be limited, but he had not identified what the award would have been without these factors and thus the reduction attributable to them; and	Ilott v The Blue Cross and others	29. Finally, as noted, the respondent conceded that the claimant was entitled to contractual sick pay in respect of the period 1 – 13 March 2018, and the tribunal made a wages award in that respect.	A Achi v GMB  Anor	45. The treatment of benefits by the Court of Appeal at its para 60, cited above, might raise difficulty if taken literally. The court clearly cannot have meant that dependence on benefits increases the claimant’s needs, as disability is likely to do. In some circumstances, different from those of the present case, receipt of state support greater than the testator could sensibly provide may be an understandable reason why it was reasonable for the deceased not to make financial provision for the claimant - see for example the observations of Stamp J in In re E, deceased [1966] 1 WLR 709 at 715C. More generally, benefits are part of the resources of the claimant, and it is relevant to consider whether they will continue to be received. The court must have meant that, at least if they are means tested, receipt of them is likely to be a very relevant indication of her financial position.	Ilott v The Blue Cross and others	14. The claimant went off sick on 1 August 2022 with depression. She sent medical certificates and kept in contact with the respondent about her absence by text. The claimant resigned on 28 November 2022.	Ladbrokes Betting  Gaming Limited v Wahida Omi

The pregnancy was planned and the baby was, in Mrs Phelan’s words, “very much wanted”. In her affidavit she has described the horror of her experience during her pregnancy; the nightmare of discovering that her baby suffered from the most grievous condition; the suffering that she had to endure while waiting for the birth of the child, doomed to die (in fact her baby girl died five days before birth); the frustration and dismay at her and her husband’s inability to access medical assistance for their plight; and the dreadful torment that they both had to bear after the baby was delivered stillborn.

In the matter of an application by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for Judicial Review	47. I would distinguish this case from Rothwell . I set out earlier how the doctors saw the distinction between pleural plaques and sensitisation to platinum salts but it is, of course, ultimately a lawyer’s question whether the two conditions are distinguishable. As I see it, it is material that the pleural plaques were nothing more than a marker of exposure to asbestos dust, being symptomless in themselves and not leading to or contributing to any condition which would produce symptoms, even if the sufferer were to be exposed to further asbestos dust. Similarly, the sensitisation of the claimants in this case marks that they have already been exposed to platinum salts, but unlike the plaques, it constitutes a change to their physiological make-up which means that further exposure now carries with it the risk of an allergic reaction, and for that reason they must change their everyday lives so as to avoid such exposure. Putting it another way, they have lost part of their capacity to work or, as the claimants put it in argument, they have suffered a loss of bodily function by virtue of the physiological change caused by the company’s negligence.	Dryden and others v Johnson Matthey Plc	68. The English Law Reform Committee in its 24 th report, “Latent Damage” (November 1984, Cmnd 9390) recognised (at para 4.7) the possibility that section 11(3) might not cover such matters. It decided to model what became section 14 A of the Limitation Act 1980 on section 14 of that Act rather than section 11(3) of the Scottish Act because it was arguable that section 11(3) did not cover lack of knowledge of the causation of the damage or the identity of the persons responsible. Similarly, in its Report on Prescription and Limitation of Actions (Latent Damage and Other Related Issues) (Scot Law Com No 122), the Scottish Law Commission recorded in 1989 that, notwithstanding the first case that I mention below, there was doubt whether the discoverability formula in section 11(3) required knowledge of the cause of the damage. It recommended that the law be clarified by amending the legislation to state expressly that the discoverability formula included knowledge (a) that the loss, injury and damage was attributable in whole or in part to an act or omission and (b) of the identity of the defender. There has been no legislation to implement that report. David Johnston QC in his impressive book, “Prescription and Limitation” (2 nd ed. 2012), also recognises that there are several ways in which section 11(3) can be read: he suggests that it might require awareness of (a) the facts of the loss, its cause and the identity of the defender, or (b) only the fact of the loss, or (c) the facts of the loss and of its being caused by negligence (para 6.96). The resolution of this uncertainty is the main issue in this appeal.	David T Morrison  Co Limited ta Gael Home Interiors v ICL Plastics Limited and others	111. The Oritani concerned the Harter Act and an allegation that the vessel was unseaworthy because the compass data on board was insufficient for the safe navigation of the vessel. District Judge Kirkpatrick considered the relevant question to be whether “insufficient compass data at the commencement of the voyage is a matter affecting the seaworthiness of the vessel or whether it pertains to her navigation and management”: 40 F 2d 522, 528. He held that it was the latter, stating that:	Alize 1954 and another v Allianz Elementar Versicherungs AG and others	354. Some individual cases have been put forward in which it is said that the women in question were unable to travel abroad as a result of the failure of health professionals to provide them with appropriate assistance and advice, and endured harrowing experiences as a consequence. It may be that such cases, if established in individual applications, would be found to involve a violation of article 3. But, disturbing though those cases are, the possibility that there might be a violation of article 3 in an individual case cannot warrant a declaration that the legislation, as such, is incompatible with article 3. If a breach of article 3 were established in an individual case, the court might grant declaratory relief, but the terms of the relief would reflect the circumstances which had led to the violation. Whether it was appropriate to grant a declaration that the legislation itself was incompatible, because it could not be given effect in a manner which was compliant with article 3, would depend on a close examination of the facts of the case, and of the role which the legislation had played in bringing about the violation.

He submitted that in order to assess if the disclosure has sufficient factual content, the ET needed to identify the words. The claimant was informing her employer that the conditions in which she and colleagues had to work was having an impact on how she and others were working, including Mr Davies.	A v Carers Trust South East Wales	8. In the spring of 2010 Melissa was told by her parents that their business was experiencing difficulties. It was proposed that Great Oak Court would be sold and a smaller property purchased. It was at this point that Melissa discovered the existence of the charge dated 12 September 2008 over Great Oak Court. Melissa’s conveyancing solicitors then corresponded with Boulters. The Bank was made aware of the challenge to the validity of its charge and, through its solicitors, intimated a claim against Boulters. Many allegations of breach of duty (fiduciary and otherwise) were made by the Bank against Boulters.

If there is an “attribute threshold” it is clear on the authorities that it must be widely and diversely drawn. Seaworthiness is not limited to physical defects in the vessel and her equipment. It extends to documentary matters such as adequate and up-to-date charts (see, for example, Grand Champion Tankers Ltd v Norpipe A/S (The Marion) [1984] AC 563 ) and adequate piping plans (see, for example, Owners of Cargo Lately Laden on Board the Makedonia v The Makedonia [1962] P 190 and Robin Hood Flour Mills Ltd v N M Paterson & Sons Ltd (The Farrandoc) [1967] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 276 ). It extends to the mental abilities of the crew and whether they have a “disabling want of skill” or a “disabling want of knowledge” (see Papera Traders Co Ltd v Hyundai Merchant Marine Co Ltd (The Eurasian Dream) [2002] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 719 at para 129). It extends to the adequacy of the vessel’s systems such as in relation to engine maintenance (see CHS Inc Iberia SL v Far East Marine SA (The Devon) [2012] EWHC 3747 (Comm) ) or hot works and fire safety (see Various Claimants v Maersk Line A/S (The Maersk Karachi) [2020] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 98 ). It may extend to the cargo on the vessel, as, for example, where it is stowed so as to endanger the vessel (see Kopitoff v Wilson (1876) 1 QBD 733 ) or where a dangerous cargo does so (see Northern Shipping Co v Deutsche Seereederei GmbH (The Kapitan Sakharov) [2000] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 586 ). It also extends to residues of previous cargo which render the holds of a vessel unfit for carriage (see, for example, Empresa Cubana Importada de Alimentos “Alimport” v Iasmos Shipping Co SA (The Good Friend) [1984] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 593 ). It even extends to the trading history of the vessel, as illustrated by Ciampa v British India Steam Navigation Co [1915] 2 KB 774 in which it was held that the vessel was unseaworthy at the commencement of a voyage for the carriage of lemons from Naples to Marseille because, having called at the plague port of Mombasa, she would inevitably have to undergo fumigation at Marseilles which would cause damage to the cargo. If “attribute” is to have such a wide and extended meaning as to cover all these eventualities, it is unlikely to be of definitional assistance.	Alize 1954 and another v Allianz Elementar Versicherungs AG and others	172. In any event, there are obvious difficulties in identifying precisely when, why or how someone first falls ill. Is it when they first exhibit the symptoms? Or is it when they are first exposed to the infection? Why are they unwell? How has that happened? If a crew is on a particularly tight schedule, with a meal then a flight, then a rest and then a repeat for the return flight, how can it be safely worked out when, why or how the crew member actually fell ill, and whether that happened, as Cityflyer would have it, on their own time or the carrier’s time? The scheme under the Regulation is not designed to require investigation of these questions.	Lipton and another v BA Cityflyer Ltd

Gillen LJ expressed disagreement with these statements in para 91 of his judgment. He considered that it was “institutionally inappropriate” for the court to “change the effect of the legislation and its interpretation in R v Bourne ”. Weatherup LJ also disagreed with the Lord Chief Justice’s view that contemporary standards could serve to enlarge the scope of the Bourne exception. He pointed out that the law as expressed by Macnaghten J had been applied by the Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland in the FPANI case where Nicholson LJ said at para 75:	In the matter of an application by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for Judicial Review	39. Nevertheless, counsel for the appellant submitted that in McInnes Lord Hope of Craighead had qualified his general statement of the law to that effect by the following words:	Macklin v Her Majestys Advocate	46. I return to the cases of Rothwell and Cartledge . Although other authorities were cited, including some relating to claims for damage to property, I have found them of little direct, or even indirect, assistance and therefore, like Jay J and the Court of Appeal, my focus has been upon these two central cases.	Dryden and others v Johnson Matthey Plc	103. I agree that all else being equal, it is in principle desirable, though not necessary, that there should be the same test for capacity in both the civil and criminal law. I also agree that even if the same test for capacity applies in the civil and criminal law, a jury will not need to be directed in strict accordance with the language used by, and steps to be adopted in accordance with, proceedings brought pursuant to the MCA: see R v A (G) [2014] 1 WLR 2469 , para 19 as more accurately recorded at [2014] EWCA Crim 299 .

On the safe port issue (question 1), I would hold that the port was not unsafe within the meaning of the safe port undertaking so that the charterers were not in breach of it. The conditions in the port amounted to an abnormal occurrence as that expression is understood in the cases.	Gard Marine and Energy Limited v China National Chartering Company Limited and another	25. In order to understand the contexts in which the phrase “a criminal cause or matter” has been used, it is relevant to trace briefly the historical background. In the 19th century, English law allowed very little scope for appeals in criminal cases: see Holdsworth, A History of English Law , vol I, p 217. Instead, in 1848 the Court for Crown Cases Reserved was created as a court constituted by a panel of judges to which a judge in a trial on indictment could refer questions of law for authoritative ruling. Where it emerged that a conviction was unsafe, recourse had to be made to the exercise of the prerogative of mercy. However, in addition, the Court of Queen’s Bench was a superior court which had jurisdiction to control the exercise of jurisdiction by magistrates and other inferior courts in criminal cases, as well as in civil matters, by means of the issue of the prerogative writs and by declaratory and other relief in what are in modern times categorised as judicial review proceedings.

In Bewley , the FTT held that a derelict and dilapidated bungalow was not suitable for use as a dwelling for the purposes of a charge under Schedule 4ZA. It had not been in use as a dwelling at the time of the transaction and had lain empty for a number of years. There were no floorboards, pipework or radiators, and asbestos was extensively present which precluded renovation and required that the property be demolished. The FTT held that the asbestos had the effect that the renovation which would have been required to it was “not a feasible proposition, because the asbestos would be disturbed” ([45] of Bewley ), “with the presence of asbestos preventing any repairs or alterations that would not pose a risk to those carrying them out” ([53] of Bewley ).

As for The Aquacharm, the key feature of that case was the consequence of the vessel having been overloaded, rather than the fact that the defect involved overloading of cargo. There can be no doubt that overloading of a vessel can cause a vessel to be unseaworthy, as, for example, if it renders the vessel unstable. It did not do so in The Aquacharm because its sole consequence was to cause some delay and expense (a “temporary or minor impediment” - per Staughton J in The Good Friend at p 593). That is the context in which the comments about what is meant by seaworthiness need to be considered. Indeed, Shaw LJ recognised at p 126 that unseaworthiness is not limited to the attributes of the vessel in herself when he referred to it as connoting “an inherent quality with which the unit comprising vessel and cargo is invested” (emphasis added). (Alize 1954 and another v Allianz Elementar Versicherungs AG and others)	95. As for The Aquacharm, the key feature of that case was the consequence of the vessel having been overloaded, rather than the fact that the defect involved overloading of cargo. There can be no doubt that overloading of a vessel can cause a vessel to be unseaworthy, as, for example, if it renders the vessel unstable. It did not do so in The Aquacharm because its sole consequence was to cause some delay and expense (a “temporary or minor impediment” - per Staughton J in The Good Friend at p 593). That is the context in which the comments about what is meant by seaworthiness need to be considered. Indeed, Shaw LJ recognised at p 126 that unseaworthiness is not limited to the attributes of the vessel in herself when he referred to it as connoting “an inherent quality with which the unit comprising vessel and cargo is invested” (emphasis added).	Alize 1954 and another v Allianz Elementar Versicherungs AG and others	94. The authorities relied upon by Phillips LJ in The Apostolis , namely The Thorsa [1916] P 257 and Elder Dempster & Co Ltd v Paterson, Zochonis & Co Ltd [1924] AC 522 , concerned negligent stowage of the cargo and the focus of the analysis in those cases was upon the consequences of that stowage. In circumstances where there was no defect in the vessel herself and the effect of the stowage of the cargo was to cause damage to adjacent cargo, but to pose no danger to the vessel, the cases were treated as involving merely bad stowage rather than unseaworthiness. That reasoning does not require the prescription of an attribute threshold, nor is it directly applicable to the different facts in The Apostolis where the fire in the cargo did pose a danger to the vessel.	Alize 1954 and another v Allianz Elementar Versicherungs AG and others	“189. The Tribunal accepts the evidence of the officials from the various predecessor Health Boards as to the nature of the business activities conducted. These were Nequas work, Food-testing, Water-testing, Non-Medical testing of samples, especially for public health, and research and development. In the context of this Claim the nature of the work done did not change and it is reasonable to infer that the nature of the inputs would not have changed markedly. The Tribunal finds that the Claim all along has been for unrecovered input tax attributable to taxable business supplies made throughout the period 1974 to 1997, and while reduced in total, it is essentially the same.”	Commissioners for His Majestys Revenue and Customs v NHS Lothian Health Board Scotland	11. There then follow articles 3 to 11 under the head “Conservation of natural habitats and habitats of species”. Within these provisions one should note article 6(2): “Member states shall take appropriate steps to avoid, in the special areas of conversation, the deterioration of natural habitats and the habitats of species as well as disturbance of the species for which the areas have been designated, in so far as such disturbance could be significant in relation to the objectives of this Directive.”	Morge FC v Hampshire County Council	2. The main issue raised on the appeal is whether, as the appellants contend, the carrier’s obligation under the Hague Rules is subject to a category-based distinction between a vessel’s quality of seaworthiness or navigability and the crew’s act of navigating. It is said that there is a distinction between seaworthiness, which concerns the attributes and equipment of the vessel, and the navigation and management of the vessel, which concerns how the crew operates the vessel using those attributes and equipment. A further and related issue arises in relation to the obligation of due diligence. It is the appellants’ case that so long as the carrier has equipped the vessel with all that is necessary for her to be safely navigated, including a competent crew, then the crew’s failure to navigate the vessel safely is not a lack of due diligence by the carrier.	Alize 1954 and another v Allianz Elementar Versicherungs AG and others	102. In support of their suggested category-based distinction between equipping a vessel with all that the crew may need (navigability) and the crew’s failure to make use of such equipment (negligence in navigation), the owners relied on the judgment of Scrutton LJ in Madras Electrical Supply Co v P&O Steam Navigation Co (1924) 18 Ll L Rep 93. In that case it was held that a failure to have an emergency guy did not amount to unseaworthiness in circumstances where the master had the requisite tackle on board to fit up the guy. In his judgment Scrutton LJ stated as follows, at pp 97-98:	Alize 1954 and another v Allianz Elementar Versicherungs AG and others	(3) This section is subject to section 5 and Schedule 1 (exceptions to savings and incorporation) and section 5A (savings and incorporation: supplementary).”	Lipton and another v BA Cityflyer Ltd	II the issue of substance	AM v Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust  Anor	(3) This section is subject to section 5 and Schedule 1 (exceptions to savings and incorporation) and section 5A (savings and incorporation: supplementary).

Oliver LJ summarised his conclusions as follows at p 1424: “… in a consideration of what is just to be done in the exercise of the court’s powers under the Act of 1973 in the light of the conduct of the parties, the court must, I think, start from the position that a solemn and freely negotiated bargain by which a party defines her own requirements ought to be adhered to unless some clear and compelling reason, such as, for instance, a drastic change of circumstances, is shown to the contrary.” The court held that no good reason had been shown not to hold the wife to her agreement.	Radmacher formerly Granatino v Granatino	65. So what was he to do? A respectable case could be made for at least three very different solutions:	Ilott v The Blue Cross and others	50. Since then her blogs had become more critical. She had blogged under an assumed woman’s name and started using one of her own names but not her whole name. She said it was a very common name. She did not know if this would work as a security measure but it seems a sensible precaution.	AB v Secretary of State for the Home Department	65. In my judgment, each of those findings was open to the Tribunal to make. The evidence which the Tribunal considered included the detailed history of the Claimant’s panic attacks as set out in his Disability Impact Statement. The Claimant said that he suffered from panic attacks from the age of 15 but that these had “no obvious cause” although they were often associated “with being in a confined claustrophobic space or situation.” He described the symptoms of having a panic attack, which included “over breathing in the form of short, fast shallow breaths”. The Claimant stated that he believed that his propensity to have panic attacks arose from the fact that he has a “very analytical and philosophical disposition which resulted in a fixation upon the nature of reality, existence and consciousness.” He referred to breathing techniques which he was taught to prevent such attacks and to cope with them when they did occur. One such technique was to place a paper bag over his nose and mouth in order to try to rebalance oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood, although the Claimant “cannot say that [he] found it particularly beneficial.” The Claimant refers to being prescribed a large daily dose of Dothiepin (a sedative) in the final year of university to prevent and cope with the attacks. He continued to take that medication until he reached his early forties (the Claimant is now aged 51). The Claimant’s records suggest (and the Tribunal so found) that the Claimant ceased taking medication for panic attacks in about 2013.

The challenge to the accuracy of his conclusion that section 100 (3B) applies to proceedings brought by way of an appeal under the 1995 Act raises two questions. The first is whether, as the Lord Justice Clerk indicated in para 38 of his opinion, that section is rendered inapplicable simply because criminal appeals are brought under the 1995 Act and not under the Scotland Act. The second is whether the wording of the amended section 100 of the Scotland Act itself shows that it has no application to any criminal proceedings, even at the stage of an appeal. (Jude and others v Her Majestys Advocate Scotland)	12. The challenge to the accuracy of his conclusion that section 100 (3B) applies to proceedings brought by way of an appeal under the 1995 Act raises two questions.

Jude and others v Her Majestys Advocate Scotland	51. As I understand it the Court is agreed (although not for identical reasons) that the legislation now in point, section 45 of the Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform)(Scotland) Act 2007, does not infringe section 29(2) (b) of the Scotland Act. The Court is however divided as to the effect of section 29(2) (c). Lord Rodger and Lord Kerr take the view that section 45 of the 2007 Act infringes section 29(2) (c) and Schedule 4, para 2 (being “special to a reserved matter” for the purposes of para 2(3) and not being saved by para 3, relating to incidental or consequential modifications).	Martin v Her Majestys Advocate Scotland	171. For these reasons, and for the reasons more fully given by Lord Hope and Lord Rodger, I am therefore satisfied that section 45 of the Criminal Proceedings etc (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 does not relate to reserved matters within the meaning to be ascribed to that condition in section 29(2) (b) of the Scotland Act 1998 .	Martin v Her Majestys Advocate Scotland	75. Although these are, of course, Scottish references and, rather to my regret, we have not had the benefit of any intervention on behalf of English and Welsh prosecuting authorities to assist us as to the legal position south of the border, I cannot but notice that on their face the statutory provisions governing the position in England and Wales sit a little uneasily even with the absolute rule in Cadder , let alone with the substantial extension to that rule now proposed by the respective accused in these references.	Ambrose v Harris Procurator Fiscal Oban Scotland	145. In para 39 Lord Hope considers that it “would be to carry the process of analysis too far” to say that the Schedule contains two maximum sentences, one for summary proceedings and the other for proceedings on indictment. But that is precisely what Parliament does say in section 33(1) of the RTOA read together with the relevant entry in the Schedule (referring to “the maximum punishment by way of … imprisonment” and giving different figures depending on “the mode of trial”). Lord Hope also thinks that it would be carrying the process of analysis too far to say that both of these maximum sentences are “special”. Apparently this is because such a decision depends on an exercise of judgment in which the purpose of “the provision” (here, section 45 ) may be the best guide. But, as the cross headings show, para 2 of Part I of Schedule 4 is designed to protect the law on reserved matters from modification. It is therefore necessary to identify which rules of Scots criminal law are to be regarded as “special to a reserved matter” in terms of para 2(3) and so protected from modification. Since, ex hypothesi, these rules cannot be modified, they cannot be identified by reference to the purpose of a provision which purports to modify them.	Martin v Her Majestys Advocate Scotland	28. Section 71 of the 1873 Act provided that: “the practice and procedure in all criminal causes and matters whatsoever in the High Court of Justice and in the Court of Appeal respectively, including the practice and procedure with respect to Crown Cases Reserved, shall be the same as the practice and procedure in similar causes and matters before the passing of this Act .”	In the matter of an application by Deborah McGuinness for Judicial Review Northern Ireland	62. For the appellant Mr Matthew Ryder QC correctly submitted that such a parliamentary intention will often be gathered from an ancillary provision preventing the use in criminal prosecutions of answers or material disclosed, or sometimes limiting such use to specific kinds of prosecution, such as for giving false information on the occasion of the questioning. As he says, no such ancillary provision is present here.	Beghal v Director of Public Prosecutions	132. Unquestionably, section 33 of the RTOA and the relevant entry in Part I of Schedule 2 comprise a rule of Scots criminal law to the effect that, on a summary conviction of a contravention of section 103(1) (b) of the RTA, the maximum punishment by way of imprisonment which may be imposed on the offender is 6 months. That is the rule which section 45 purports to modify. Paragraph 2(1) of Part I of Schedule 4 prevents the Scottish Parliament from modifying a rule of Scots criminal law only to the extent that the rule is “special to a reserved matter”. So the Court has to decide whether this rule is “special” to a reserved matter.	Martin v Her Majestys Advocate Scotland	143. At para 34 of his judgment, Lord Hope accepts that, when considering para 2 of Part I of Schedule 4, the starting-point is identifying the rule of Scots criminal law that is being modified. Then one must ask whether that rule is special to a reserved matter. Naturally, I agree. Lord Hope takes the view that the purpose of the enactment may be referred to in order to identify the rule of law that is being modified. I see no room for that approach in this case. Here, the purpose of the enactment is clear and undisputed: to increase the sheriff’s summary sentencing powers. If, however, you want to know which rules of Scottish criminal law the enactment is modifying in order to achieve that purpose, you simply have to look at the perfectly clear terms of section 45 and apply them to the penal provisions in question.	Martin v Her Majestys Advocate Scotland	22. This analysis shows that the questions which lie at the heart of this case are: (1) whether the purpose of section 45 was to make a modification to Scots criminal law as defined in section 126(5); (2) if so, whether its purpose was to make the law apply consistently to reserved matters and otherwise; and (3) if it passes those tests, whether the rule that it sought to modify was special to a reserved matter within the meaning of paragraph 2(3) of Schedule 4.

In the light of the above, I consider that the Court of Appeal focused too narrowly on the disclosures already made on the internet, and did not give due weight to the qualitative difference in intrusiveness and distress likely to be involved in what is now proposed by way of unrestricted publication by the English media in hard copy as well as on their own internet sites. There is little doubt that there would be a media storm. It would involve not merely disclosure of names and generalised description of the nature of the sexual activities involved, but the most intimate details. This would be likely to add greatly and on a potentially enduring basis to the intrusiveness and distress felt by the appellant, his partner and, by way of increased media attention now and/or in the future, their children. The Court of Appeal did not do justice to this qualitative difference either when it said that the “wall-to-wall excoriation which the claimant fears has already been taking place for the last two weeks in the English press”, as a result of “numerous headlines such as ‘celebrity love cheat’ and ‘Gag couple alleged to have had a threesome’” (para 47(ii), or when it went on to refer to the likely impact of the proposed publication as “a further unwelcome intrusion”, increasing what is being suffered already, not “a shock revelation, as publication in January would have been” (para 47(iii)). (PJS v News Group Newspapers Ltd)	35.

PJS v News Group Newspapers Ltd	131. For my part, therefore, I consider that Mr Fitzgerald’s alternative case is unanswerable. How can it possibly have been Parliament’s intention to allow the CPS to take over and prevent a private prosecution where a reasonable prosecutor could take the view that a reasonable court is likely to convict? This is to leave the victim (who, as Lord Mance points out, knows whether or not she is the victim of crime) to the chance of which among many no doubt entirely reasonable prosecutors handles her case. The fact that this is done on paper without any face to face contact with the witnesses only increases the possibility that reasonable prosecutors can take different views.	R on the application of Gujra v Crown Prosecution Service	56. The need for a legally defensible justification for the provision arises from the fact, conceded on behalf of the Crown, that the application of section 39(2)(a)(i) involves an interference with rights guaranteed by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, since it involves the disclosure of information about an earlier police charge. That concession departs from the Crown’s position before the courts below.	AB v Her Majestys Advocate	124. Likewise, the failure or refusal of Parliament to enact a provision making answers or information obtained by use of Schedule 7 powers inadmissible in proceedings disposes of any possible argument that this measure goes no further than is required to meet its aim. The opinion of the independent reviewer and the Divisional Court that this enactment should be made has not been challenged. While the provision remains in force, that aspect of the Schedule 7 powers is not only not in accordance with law (for the reasons earlier given) but also, ipso facto, more than is necessary to fulfil the objective of the interference.	Beghal v Director of Public Prosecutions	132. A person’s reasonable expectations as to privacy are a significant factor under the Convention, as they are in our domestic law. In that regard, it is material that doctors voluntarily provide their patients with their name, and that doctors and nurses generally wear name badges. (4) Differentiating between clinicians	Abbasi and another v Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust	120. We also note that section 12(1) of the Administration of Justice Act 1960 provides that the publication of information relating to proceedings before any court sitting in private shall not of itself be contempt of court except in certain specified circumstances, including “(a) where the proceedings – (i) relate to the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction of the High Court with respect to minors”. As Munby J said in Kelly v British Broadcasting Corpn [2001] Fam 59 , 72, summarising a number of earlier authorities, “in essence, what section 12 protects is the privacy and confidentiality: (i) of the documents on the court file and (ii) of what has gone on in front of the judge in his courtroom”. Accordingly, it covers the names of the witnesses who gave evidence or provided statements, the identities of the experts who provided reports, and the contents of their evidence, statements and reports. It follows that, by virtue of section 12 , the publication of the witnesses’ and experts’ names, either by the media or by the parents, would have rendered them liable to proceedings for contempt of court. That reflects the common law: In re Martindale [1894] 3 Ch 193 ; In re De Beaujeu’s Application for Writ of Attachment against Cudlipp [1949] Ch 230 . For that reason also, the injunction could not be regarded as impinging upon open justice.	Abbasi and another v Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust	10. The accused in the third case, referred to as G, has been indicted in the High Court of Justiciary with offences including the possession of controlled drugs under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and possession of prohibited firearms and ammunition under the Firearms Act 1968 . The police had obtained a search warrant under the 1971 Act for the search of a flat where on 4 June 2008, having forced entry, they found the accused. Before commencing the search in terms of the warrant the accused, who had been handcuffed following a struggle, was cautioned in these terms: “A systematic search will be carried out in your presence. I must caution that you are not obliged to say anything or make any comment regarding any article that may be found, but anything you do say will be noted and may be used in evidence.” The accused was then detained and searched. Prior to being searched he admitted to having drugs in his jeans pocket, from which a bag of brown powder was recovered that was later found to be heroin. He was then arrested for contravention of section 23(4) of the 1971 Act . He was not arrested or charged with any other offence in the course of the search of the premises. During the search he was asked questions about the items which were found. He was not offered access to legal advice or to a solicitor before being asked these questions. After the search was concluded he was removed to a police station where he was detained under section 14 of the 1995 Act and again interviewed by the police in connection with alleged offences involving controlled drugs and firearms. He was not allowed access to legal advice before or during this interview.	Ambrose v Harris Procurator Fiscal Oban Scotland	78. In summary, extensive inroads have been made into areas that previously fell within the exclusive cognisance of Parliament. Following Ex p Herbert there appears to have been a presumption in Parliament that statutes do not apply to activities within the Palace of Westminster unless they expressly provide to the contrary. That presumption is open to question. In 1984 three Law Lords, Lord Diplock, Lord Scarman and Lord Bridge of Harwich, on the Committee for Privileges expressed the view that sections 2 -6 of the Mental Health Act 1983 applied to members of the House of Lords, although the Act did not expressly so state.	R v Chaytor and others	99. The position seems to me to be the same, as a matter of ordinary English, where concealment takes the form of the withholding of information with the intention of keeping it secret. For example, Samuel Pepys concealed the contents of his diary by writing it in code; but that does not imply that he was under an obligation to reveal what he had written. Someone who decides not to tell anyone that he has been diagnosed with cancer can properly be described as concealing his illness, without any implication that he is under an obligation to share the information. It is to be noted that in all the examples I have given, as in most if not all cases where “conceal” is used in the active mood, concealment involves intentional hiding or withholding of information. This underlines the importance of the explicit emphasis placed by Parliament on the requirement that the relevant fact must have been “deliberately concealed”.	Canada Square Operations Ltd v Potter	114. Section 29(4) of the 1998 Act has also to be considered, however, since it contemplates the possibility that a provision whose purpose does not otherwise relate to a reserved matter may nevertheless be treated as relating to a reserved matter and so fall outside the competence of the Scottish Parliament. Sub section (4 ) applies to a provision which “makes modifications of Scots private law, or Scots criminal law, as it applies to reserved matters”. So the subsection would apply only if section 45 could be said to make a modification to Scots criminal law “as it applies to reserved matters”.	Martin v Her Majestys Advocate Scotland

Lord Sumption describes the development of English law in this area in paras 6 to 10 and the differences between an award under the FAA and under article 844 BGB in para 11. The FAA creates a new cause of action in favour of dependants (and in favour of a spouse in respect of bereavement): Seward v Vera Cruz (1884) 10 App Cas 59 , 67, per Lord Selborne LC; Davidson v Hill [1901] 2 KB 606 , 614. Any claim for pain, suffering or other loss suffered by the deceased before death is distinct from these new claims for loss or dependency and bereavement. This is so even though these new claims only arise where the deceased would, if death had not ensued, have had a claim for damages for any loss he or she incurred. That is a mere pre-condition to the new causes of action.	Cox v Ergo Versicherung AG	39. Ms Egan submitted that the remedy findings were perverse, in particular, because the Dr Watts report made clear that, prior to the assault, it was the bereavement that had been sole source of the claimant’s anxiety. The report, and the tribunal’s liability decision, then considered the additional anxiety and PTSD caused by the stranger assault. The findings in the remedy decision were contrary to those earlier findings, as to the particular sources of her anxiety.	Edenbeck Limited v E Stevenson

In Bourne a surgeon performed an abortion on a young girl of 14 years who had become pregnant as a result of rape. He was charged under section 58 of the 1861 Act with unlawfully procuring an abortion. The jury was directed that it was for the prosecution to prove that the operation was not performed in good faith for the purpose of preserving the life of the girl. The surgeon was not obliged to wait until the patient was in peril of immediate death. As to the words of the 1929 Act , that “no person shall be found guilty of an offence under this section unless it is proved that the act which caused the death of the child was not done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother”, Macnaghten J (the trial judge) said to the jury that, although those words did not appear in section 58 of the 1861 Act , they were “implied by the word ‘unlawful’ in that section”. Those words ought to be construed “in a reasonable sense” said Macnaghten J, and it was, therefore, the surgeon’s duty to perform the operation if he was of the reasonable opinion that the probable consequence of the pregnancy continuing would be to make the patient “a physical and mental wreck”.	In the matter of an application by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for Judicial Review	20. Although the current state of the law has been criticised for its lack of clarity - and is certainly not as clear as is the law in the rest of the UK - it is no more uncertain than many other areas of the law which rely upon the application of particular concepts - in this case a risk to life or of serious and prolonged or permanent injury to physical or mental health - to the facts of a particular case. It is also sufficiently accessible to those affected by it for the interference to be “in accordance with the law” for this purpose.	In the matter of an application by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for Judicial Review	118. Nicklinson was also a different case from the present in significant respects. First, it centred on a difficult balancing exercise between the interests of different adult persons: on the one hand, the sufferer with locked-in syndrome, unable to act autonomously, but unable to receive assistance to commit suicide; on the other hand, the others, elderly or infirm, who might feel pressured by others or by themselves to commit suicide, if assistance were permissible. The balancing of autonomy and suffering against the risks to others was and is a particularly sensitive matter. The legislature had chosen an absolute protection against the latter risks, with which the courts should not, at least at that juncture, interfere.	In the matter of an application by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for Judicial Review	77. The word “unlawfulness” used in sections 58 and 59 of the 1861 Act was explained by Macnaghten J in directions given to the jury in the seminal case of R v Bourne [1939] 1 KB 687 ; [1938] 3 All ER 615 . In order to understand its scope, he pointed to different wording used to define an associated offence in both the Infant Life (Preservation) Act 1929 in England and section 25 of the 1945 Act. Under both provisions, it is necessary to prove “that the act which caused the death of the child was not done in good faith for the purpose only of preserving the life of the mother”. Macnaghten J held that the same requirement was implied by the word “unlawful” in section 58 (and, it follows, section 59). He also considered that “impairment of health might reach a stage where it was a danger to life”, and that the words “ought to be construed in a reasonable sense, and, if the doctor is of opinion, on reasonable grounds and with adequate knowledge, that the probable consequence of the continuance of the pregnancy will be to make the woman a physical or mental wreck, the jury are quite entitled to take the view that the doctor, who, in these circumstances, and in that honest belief, operates, is operating for the purpose of preserving the life of the mother”: pp 693-694.	In the matter of an application by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission for Judicial Review	237. In those circumstances, to treat the cause of action recognised in Kleinwort Benson as falling within the scope of section 32(1) involves no breach of the general principle that “when the facts are known from which a right arises, the right is presumed to be known”. Nor, recalling Sir Richard Collins MR’s judgment in Molloy , is there any inconsistency with his statement that:	Test Claimants in the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation and others v Commissioners for Her	79. The rationale is that in such a situation that measure represents the loss which may fairly and reasonably be considered as arising naturally, ie according to the ordinary course of things, from the breach of contract ( Hadley v Baxendale ). It is fair and reasonable because it reflects the wrong for which the guilty party has been responsible and the resulting financial disadvantage to the innocent party at the date of the breach. The guilty party has been responsible for depriving the innocent party of the benefit of performance under the original contract (and is simultaneously released from his own unperformed obligations). The availability of a substitute market enables a market valuation to be made of what the innocent party has lost, and a line thereby to be drawn under the transaction.	Bunge SA v Nidera BV	29. In the present case it is common ground that the lex causae arrived at on ordinary principles of private international law is not English but German law. There is nothing in the language of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 to suggest that its provisions were intended to apply irrespective of the choice of law derived from ordinary principles of private international law. Such an intention would therefore have to be implied. Implied extra-territorial effect is certainly possible, and there are a number of examples of it. But in most if not all cases, it will arise only if (i) the terms of the legislation cannot effectually be applied or its purpose cannot effectually be achieved unless it has extra-territorial effect; or (ii) the legislation gives effect to a policy so significant in the law of the forum that Parliament must be assumed to have intended that policy to apply to any one resorting to an English court regardless of the law that would otherwise apply.	Cox v Ergo Versicherung AG	53. Furthermore, it is quite clear that damage can be suffered by the same person in more than one place, just as the wrongful acts can be committed in more than one place. The Court of Appeal in Metall must have been right to say that the Rules contemplated the possibility of there being jurisdiction in more than one place. Nor do I find the distinction between direct and indirect damage easy to draw in all cases. If I am seriously injured in a road accident, the pain, suffering and loss of amenity that I suffer are all part of the same injury and in cases of permanent disability will be with me wherever I am.	Four Seasons Holdings Incorporated v Brownlie	41. There is a consistent line of first instance decisions holding that, in a case which is not governed by the European jurisdictional rules, a claim in tort may be brought in England if damage is suffered here as a result of personal injuries inflicted abroad. The first is Booth v Phillips [2004] EWCA 1437 (Comm), a decision of Nigel Teare QC (as he then was). This was a widow’s claim in negligence for her own loss of dependency and the funeral expenses of the estate of her deceased husband who had died while working as chief engineer on a vessel in Egypt. The judge rejected the argument that “damage” referred to the damage which completed the cause of action. This was not what the rule said. The words used should be given their “ordinary and natural meaning, namely, harm which has been sustained by the claimant, whether physical or economic” (para 35). Dropping the definite article reflected the decision in Metall that it was enough that some significant damage had been sustained here. He also rejected the argument that this was “improbably wide”, because the court had also to be satisfied that it was appropriate, in Spiliada terms, to exercise jurisdiction.

In doing so, I do not conclude that “safe” is not the antonym of “dangerous” in the two sections, only that there is nothing in section 29 to introduce the principle of reasonable foreseeability into the meaning of “safe”. I note in passing that, as Lord Mance says at para 67, the Close line of case law has received mixed academic commentary. It was criticised by Munkman in his article “The Fencing of Machinery” 1962 LJ 761, where he said at p 761 that “foreseeability” is not to be found in the Factories Act, that it is an alien importation from the law of negligence and that, since negligence is a lower standard of liability, to import its concepts would necessarily reduce liability under the statute. Close was also criticised by the authors of the 1970-72 Safety and Health at Work Report of the Committee chaired by Lord Robens. Appendix 7 reviewed the case law on statutory safety provisions. At para 7 on p 186, the authors criticised the Close line of case law as contrary to the interests of accident prevention. In my opinion, given that the section 14(1) cases are susceptible to criticism, even on their own terms, we should be cautious about transferring the rationale to other provisions, particularly when so many cases have decided that it is inappropriate to do so. (Baker v Quantum Clothing Group Limited and others)	203. I entirely agree with the reasoning of Lord Sutherland and Lord Johnston in those passages.

Baker v Quantum Clothing Group Limited and others	4. The conceptual structure of the tort of negligence	Khan v Meadows	120. Smith LJ accepted (and Mr Hendy QC accepts) that reasonable foreseeability is relevant to reasonable practicability: “As a matter of common sense, if the employer does not know of the risk and cannot reasonably have been expected to know of it, it cannot be reasonably practicable for him to take any steps at all” (para 83). That was also the view of the courts in Larner and Mains .	Baker v Quantum Clothing Group Limited and others	116. The second strand includes the cases mentioned by Lord Mance at para 73. In Larner v British Steel plc [1993] ICR 551 , Hirst LJ approved a passage in Munkman, Employer’s Liability , 11th ed (1990) p 292, where the author expressed the view that “safe” was a simple English word and there was no reason why the safety of a place of work should not be decided as a pure question of fact. Hirst LJ regretted the introduction of “the vague and uncertain notion of foreseeability”. Peter Gibson J said that it was not unfair on employers to impose a strict duty, because the duty was qualified by the defence of reasonable practicability. To introduce the concept of reasonable foreseeability into the question of safety was effectively to equate the duty under the section with the duty at common law.	Baker v Quantum Clothing Group Limited and others	66. Finally, Yip J asked herself whether it is fair, just and reasonable to impose liability in negligence for the totality of A’s disabilities. But, as Nicola Davies LJ stated, this case does not concern a novel application of the law of negligence in which it is necessary for the court to address that question because established principles provide an answer: Robinson (above) para 27 per Lord Reed.	Khan v Meadows	79. Peter Gibson J (at p 562G-H) regarded it as surprising that the approach in John Summers , based on section 14(1) of the 1937 Act containing no qualification of reasonable practicability, should have been regarded as relevant under section 29(1) of the 1961 Act which does contain such a qualification. The same point was made in Mains (pp 527A-D and 531D-F, per Lord Sutherland and p 536A, per Lord Johnston). But there was authority pre-dating 1959 which took the same approach to safety where there was such a qualification: see Sheppey v Matthew T Shaw & Co Ltd and Trott v W E Smith (Erectors) Ltd (para 65 above). The force of the point depends in any event upon the effect of the qualification. In Mains it was contemplated that the qualification might enable a defender to “say it was not reasonably practicable to make this place safe, because this particular mishap was not reasonably foreseeable” (p 527C-D, per Lord Sutherland) and that “The unforeseeable accident occurring in an unforeseeable way may well give the defenders a defence under the qualification” (p 637E, per Lord Johnston). Likewise, in the present case the Court of Appeal considered “as a matter of common sense” that “if, the employer does not know of the risk and cannot reasonably have been expected to know of it, it cannot be reasonably practicable for him to take any steps at all” (paras 83 and 91). On that basis, foresight can be very relevant under section 29(1) . But, if this is so, then section 29(1) is to that extent merely shifting the onus of proof, which weakens the argument that it must be seen as departing substantially from conceptions of common law negligence.	Baker v Quantum Clothing Group Limited and others	198. Peter Gibson J then noted that the views to the contrary by Diplock LJ in Taylor v Coalite were obiter and expressed before the decision in Nimmo , where Lord Guest said this at p 122: “To treat the onus as being on the pursuer seems to equiparate the duty under the statute to the duty under common law, namely, to take such steps as are reasonably practicable to keep the working place safe. I cannot think that the section was intended to place such a limited obligation on employers.” Peter Gibson J referred to three conflicting Scottish cases, namely Keenan v Rolls-Royce Ltd 1970 SLT 90, Robertson v RB Crowe & Co 1970 SLT 122 and Morrow v Enterprise Sheet Metal Works (Aberdeen) Ltd 1986 SLT 697. He concluded that on the then state of the authorities the court was free to choose whether to apply the test of reasonable foreseeability. In agreement with Hirst LJ he said that he preferred to read the section without implying any such test. I entirely agree with both the approach of Peter Gibson J and with his reasons, which he put very clearly.	Baker v Quantum Clothing Group Limited and others	72. More recently, in Robb v Salamis (M & I) Ltd [2006] UKHL 56 ; [2007] ICR 175 , Lord Hope confirmed the relevance of reasonable foreseeability to article 5(1) of the Framework Directive 89/391/EEC (imposing on employers the duty to ensure the safety and health of workers in every aspect related to the work) and article 3(1) of the Work Equipment Directive 89/655/EEC (requiring employers to take the measures necessary to ensure that the work equipment made available to workers is suitable for the work to be carried out), stating that “The obligation is to anticipate situations which may give rise to accidents” (para 24).	Baker v Quantum Clothing Group Limited and others	75. Larner concerned an undetected crack which caused a structure to fall on the plaintiff. The Court of Appeal preferred the reasoning in Robertson to Diplock LJ’s dicta in Taylor and rejected foreseeability as a test of safety. In Mains the injury arose when a piece of machinery made an involuntary and unexpected movement, the cause of which was never ascertained, and so trapped the workman’s hand; and it was common ground that the circumstances of the accident and its cause were not reasonably foreseeable. The Inner House took the same view as in, and followed, Larner .	Baker v Quantum Clothing Group Limited and others	213. In any event, as explained above, section 29 does not impose absolute liability because the employer has a defence if he can establish that he took all reasonably practical precautions, which involves a consideration of what risks are reasonably foreseeable. As stated above, the first question in each case is whether the workplace was safe. If the claimant proves that it was not, the second question arises, namely whether the employer has shown that, so far as reasonably practicable, it was safe for those working there. I agree with the reasoning in Larner and Mains that, in considering whether the employer has shown that, so far as reasonably practicable, it was safe it is relevant to consider whether it was reasonably foreseeable that it was unsafe. While (as demonstrated by Lord Dyson at para 125) the language could be construed more narrowly, I agree with Lord Sutherland’s opinion expressed in the passage quoted above that, as considerations of reasonable practicability involve weighing the degree and extent of risk on the one hand against the time, trouble and expense of preventing it on the other, quite clearly foreseeability comes into the matter because it is impossible to assess the degree of risk in any other way. I also agree with Peter Gibson J to the same effect in the passage from Larner quoted above.	Baker v Quantum Clothing Group Limited and others

This much had been accepted by the Secretary of State. The appellant was photographed on the site and it was plain that the songs or some of them were supportive of Kurdish independence.	AB v Secretary of State for the Home Department	114. The authorities appear to be concerned by the influence of satellite television channels broadcasting into Iran. Although there are occasional raids resulting in mass confiscation of equipment at least 25% and possibly as much as 60% of Iranians watch satellite television. Satellite television is provided not only by internationally known major organisations, such as BBC Persian, but also by smaller groups supported by members of the diaspora. Thus an academic running a serious website with a few followers might be perceived as the kind of person who would support “damaging” satellite TV.	AB v Secretary of State for the Home Department	72. Morritt LJ focused on the particular injunction sought, and concluded that the court had no jurisdiction to grant it. As the injunction would interfere with the defendant’s exercise of his right of free speech and his proprietary right as the owner of the copyright in the book, the power to seek such an injunction could only be implied on the basis of a self-evident and pressing need. The necessity relied on was the hospital authority’s power and duty to treat the defendant. But in that event the necessity would not be confined to publications by patients alone but would extend to publications by third parties. A power of such constitutional significance was not to be implied. Only Parliament could confer such a power, and it must do so in terms which admitted of no doubt as to its intention.

Commissioners for Her Majestys Revenue and Customs v DCC Holdings UK Limited	389. On the evidence before us, TS does not appear to have the same relatively high profile as the TGTE. Nonetheless, we have been provided with credible evidence from Mr Uthayasenan (as summarised previously) that its activities are known to the Sri Lankan authorities and have been taken seriously enough for consequences to flow, including harassment within Sri Lanka in respect of attempted activities there. By way of example, an attempt by TS to open an office in Kilinochchi was met with visits by the CID and threats of detention if activities persisted. This led to an abandonment of the project. Mr Uthayasenan’s evidence also satisfies us that TS occasionally cooperates with the TGTE in respect of the organisation of events. Photographs of a demonstration organised by TS and held in October 2019 clearly show attendees holding LTTE flags. The same is true of another demonstration held a month later.	KK v SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT	17. As observed by Lord Clarke a tenancy agreement has to be interpreted in the same way as any other written contract, so the precise rights and obligations of the parties under it must depend on the terms which the parties have agreed and the circumstances in which they were agreed. However, in some circumstances, there may be principles of law which result in the parties’ intention being frustrated or modified, and, as is clear from the reasoning in Street v Mountford [1985] AC 809 , the legal consequences of what the parties have agreed is a matter of law rather than dependent on what the parties intended.

This is a characteristic that may be revealed, to a greater or lesser degree, by the way the members of this group behave. In that sense, because it manifests itself in behaviour, it is less immediately visible than a person’s race. But, unlike a person’s religion or political opinion, it is incapable of being changed. To pretend that it does not exist, or that the behaviour by which it manifests itself can be suppressed, is to deny the members of this group their fundamental right to be what they are – of the right to do simple, everyday things with others of the same orientation such as living or spending time together or expressing their affection for each other in public. (HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action)	11. The group is defined by the immutable characteristic of its members’ sexual orientation or sexuality.

HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	76. The New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority observed in Re GJ [1998] (1995) INLR 387, 420 that “sexual orientation is either an innate or unchangeable characteristic or a characteristic so fundamental to identity or human dignity that it ought not be required to be changed” (emphasis in the original). So, starting from that position, the Convention offers protection to gay and lesbian people – and, I would add, bisexuals and everyone else on a broad spectrum of sexual behaviour - because they are entitled to have the same freedom from fear of persecution as their straight counterparts. No-one would proceed on the basis that a straight man or woman could find it reasonably tolerable to conceal his or her sexual identity indefinitely to avoid suffering persecution. Nor would anyone proceed on the basis that a man or woman could find it reasonably tolerable to conceal his or her race indefinitely to avoid suffering persecution. Such an assumption about gay men and lesbian women is equally unacceptable. Most significantly, it is unacceptable as being inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the Convention since it involves the applicant denying or hiding precisely the innate characteristic which forms the basis of his claim of persecution: Atta Fosu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2008 FC 1135, para 17, per Zinn J.	HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	52. Sexual orientation is a core component of a person’s identity which requires fulfilment through relationships with others of the same orientation. As Justice Sachs of the South African Constitutional Court movingly put it in National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice , 1999 (1) SA 6, para 117: “While recognising the unique worth of each person, the Constitution does not presuppose that a holder of rights is an isolated, lonely and abstract figure possessing a disembodied and socially disconnected self. It acknowledges that people live in their bodies, their communities, their cultures, their places and their times. The expression of sexuality requires a partner, real or imagined.”	Bull and another v Hall and another	53. Heterosexuals have known this about themselves and been able to fulfil themselves in this way throughout history. Homosexuals have also known this about themselves but were long denied the possibility of fulfilling themselves through relationships with others. This was an affront to their dignity as human beings which our law has now (some would say belatedly) recognised. Homosexuals can enjoy the same freedom and the same relationships as any others. But we should not underestimate the continuing legacy of those centuries of discrimination, persecution even, which is still going on in many parts of the world. It is no doubt for that reason that Strasbourg requires “very weighty reasons” to justify discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. It is for that reason that we should be slow to accept that prohibiting hotel keepers from discriminating against homosexuals is a disproportionate limitation on their right to manifest their religion.	Bull and another v Hall and another	77. At the most basic level, if a male applicant were to live discreetly, he would in practice have to avoid any open expression of affection for another man which went beyond what would be acceptable behaviour on the part of a straight man. He would have to be cautious about the friendships he formed, the circle of friends in which he moved, the places where he socialised. He would have constantly to restrain himself in an area of life where powerful emotions and physical attraction are involved and a straight man could be spontaneous, impulsive even. Not only would he not be able to indulge openly in the mild flirtations which are an enjoyable part of heterosexual life, but he would have to think twice before revealing that he was attracted to another man. Similarly, the small tokens and gestures of affection which are taken for granted between men and women could well be dangerous. In short, his potential for finding happiness in some sexual relationship would be profoundly affected. It is objectionable to assume that any gay man can be supposed to find even these restrictions on his life and happiness reasonably tolerable.	HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	92. The notion that a gay man could (and so, some might say, should) avoid trouble by adopting a “discreet” lifestyle (or leading an entirely celibate life) is not limited to the context of asylum law. It is the way in which hundreds of thousands of gay men lived in England before the enactment of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 . But it has assumed particular importance in asylum law since gays and lesbians have become generally recognised as a particular social group for Convention purposes. Jenni Millbank has described this development (which she terms ‘discretion reasoning’) in “From discretion to disbelief: recent trends in refugee determinations on the basis of sexual orientation in Australia and the United Kingdom” (2009) 13 IJHR 391, 393-394 (most references omitted): “At its baldest, discretion reasoning entailed a ‘reasonable expectation that persons should, to the extent that it is possible, co-operate in their own protection’, by exercising ‘self-restraint’ such as avoiding any behaviour that would identify them as gay; never telling anyone they were gay; only expressing their sexuality by having anonymous sex in public places; pretending that their partner is a ‘flatmate’; or indeed remaining celibate. This approach subverted the aim of the Refugees Convention – that the receiving state provide a surrogate for protection from the home state – by placing the responsibility of protection upon the applicant: it is he or she who must avoid harm. The discretion approach also varied the scope of protection afforded in relation to each of the five Convention grounds by, for example, protecting the right to be ‘openly’ religious but not to be openly gay or in an identifiable same-sex relationship. ... The idea of discretion reflects broader social norms concerning the ‘proper place’ of lesbian and gay sexuality, as something to be hidden and reluctantly tolerated, a purely private sexual behaviour rather than an important and integral aspect of identity, or as an apparent relationship status. The discretion approach explicitly posited the principle that human rights protection available to sexual orientation was limited to private consensual sex and did not extend to any other manifestation of sexual identity (which has been variously characterised as ‘flaunting’ ‘displaying’ and ‘advertising’ homosexuality as well as ‘inviting’ persecution). Thus for example in 2001 the Federal Court of Australia held that the Iranian Penal Code prohibiting homosexuality and imposing a death penalty did ‘place limits’ on the applicant’s behaviour; the applicant had to ‘avoid overt and public, or publicly provocative homosexual activity. But having to accept those limits did not amount to persecution’. ( Nezhadian v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2001] FCA 1415, para 12). On appeal, the full Federal Court endorsed the view that ‘public manifestation of homosexuality is not an essential part of being homosexual’ ( WABR v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs [2002] FCAFC 124, para 23). The discretion approach thus has had wide-reaching ramifications in terms of framing the human rights of lesbians and gay men to family life, freedom of association and freedom of expression as necessarily lesser in scope than those held by heterosexual people.”	HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	14. The reference in the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 shows that counteracting discrimination was a fundamental purpose of the Convention. Article 2 states: “Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.” Lord Steyn emphasised this point in Islam v Secretary of State for the Home Department; R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal, Ex p Shah [1999] 2 AC 629, 639. He also drew attention to the first preamble to the Declaration, which proclaimed the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. No mention is made of sexual orientation in the preamble or any of its articles, nor is sexual orientation mentioned in article 1A(2) of the Convention. But coupled with an increasing recognition of the rights of gay people since the early 1960s has come an appreciation of the fundamental importance of their not being discriminated against in any respect that affects their core identity as homosexuals. They are as much entitled to freedom of association with others of the same sexual orientation, and to freedom of self-expression in matters that affect their sexuality, as people who are straight.	HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	33. In Karouni v Gonzales (2005) 399 F 3d 1163 the US Court of Appeals upheld an appeal by an applicant who claimed that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on return to Lebanon because he was gay. It applied the principle, which the Secretary of State in this case accepts, that he should not be required to change his sexual identity, as it was a fundamental characteristic and an integral part of human freedom. Several Canadian cases were referred to by Mr Bourne in support of his proposition that the tribunal must look at what the applicant will, rather than could, do if he were to be returned: Case no 02751 of 9 January 2007 (unreported) 16 February 2007; Atta Fosu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [2008] FC 1135 and Okoli v Minister of Citizenship and Immigration [2009] FC 332. In Atta Fosu , for example, the Federal Court held that it was impermissible to require a person to deny or hide his sexuality when there was no evidence that he could, or was even prepared to, keep it secret.	HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	97. There are some countries in which a gay couple who lived together quite openly, and made no attempt to conceal their affection, even in public places, would be ‘inviting persecution’ (an expression used in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, Ex p Binbasi [1989] Imm AR 595, p 4). That is an unfortunate expression. Some people who risk martyrdom have complex motivation and appear to others to be stubborn and wrong-headed. (John Donne, who was born a Catholic and knew a lot about persecution from his own family’s experiences, wrote a prose work entitled Pseudo-Martyr, published in 1610, deploring the intransigence of some loyal Catholics.) But neither the most courageous nor the most timorous forfeit protection as asylum seekers if, in their different ways, they satisfy the test of a well-founded fear of persecution because of their sexuality.

The submission that it is proper to examine the question whether it would be objectively reasonable for the applicant to be expected to tolerate some element of concealment – I would prefer not to use the word “discretion”, as this euphemistic expression does not tell the whole truth – when he is returned to the country of his nationality cannot be dismissed so easily. Behaviour which reveals one’s sexual orientation, whether one is gay or straight, varies from individual to individual. It occupies a wide spectrum, from people who are naturally reticent and have no particular desire to establish a sexual relationship with anybody to those who wish, for various reasons, to proclaim in public their sexual identity. Social and family disapproval of overt sexual behaviour of any kind, gay or straight, may weigh more heavily with some people than others. Concealment due to a well-founded fear of persecution is one thing. Concealment in reaction to family or social pressures is another. So one must ask why the applicant will conduct himself in this way. A carefully nuanced approach is called for, to separate out those who are truly in need of surrogate protection from those who are not.

Sexual orientation is a core component of a person’s identity which requires fulfilment through relationships with others of the same orientation. As Justice Sachs of the South African Constitutional Court movingly put it in National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice , 1999 (1) SA 6, para 117: “While recognising the unique worth of each person, the Constitution does not presuppose that a holder of rights is an isolated, lonely and abstract figure possessing a disembodied and socially disconnected self. It acknowledges that people live in their bodies, their communities, their cultures, their places and their times. The expression of sexuality requires a partner, real or imagined.” (Bull and another v Hall and another)	52.

Persecution for reasons of homosexuality was not perceived as a problem by the High Contracting Parties when the Convention was being drafted. For many years the risk of persecution in countries where it now exists seemed remote. It was the practice for leaders in these countries simply to insist that homosexuality did not exist. This was manifest nonsense, but at least it avoided the evil of persecution. More recently, fanned by misguided but vigorous religious doctrine, the situation has changed dramatically. The ultra-conservative interpretation of Islamic law that prevails in Iran is one example. The rampant homophobic teaching that right-wing evangelical Christian churches indulge in throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa is another. The death penalty has just been proposed in Uganda for persons who engage in homosexual practices. Two gay men who had celebrated their relationship in a public engagement ceremony were recently sentenced to 14 years’ imprisonment in Malawi. They were later pardoned in response to international pressure by President Mutharika, but he made it clear that he would not otherwise have done this as they had committed a crime against the country’s culture, its religion and its laws. Objections to these developments have been greeted locally with derision and disbelief.	HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	14. The reference in the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 shows that counteracting discrimination was a fundamental purpose of the Convention. Article 2 states: “Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.” Lord Steyn emphasised this point in Islam v Secretary of State for the Home Department; R v Immigration Appeal Tribunal, Ex p Shah [1999] 2 AC 629, 639. He also drew attention to the first preamble to the Declaration, which proclaimed the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family. No mention is made of sexual orientation in the preamble or any of its articles, nor is sexual orientation mentioned in article 1A(2) of the Convention. But coupled with an increasing recognition of the rights of gay people since the early 1960s has come an appreciation of the fundamental importance of their not being discriminated against in any respect that affects their core identity as homosexuals. They are as much entitled to freedom of association with others of the same sexual orientation, and to freedom of self-expression in matters that affect their sexuality, as people who are straight.	HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	54. There is no question of (as Rafferty LJ put it) replacing “legal oppression of one community (homosexual couples) with legal oppression of another (those sharing the defendants’ beliefs)” (para 56). If Mr Preddy and Mr Hall ran a hotel which denied a double room to Mr and Mrs Bull, whether on the ground of their Christian beliefs or on the ground of their sexual orientation, they would find themselves in the same situation that Mr and Mrs Bull find themselves today.	Bull and another v Hall and another	11. The group is defined by the immutable characteristic of its members’ sexual orientation or sexuality. This is a characteristic that may be revealed, to a greater or lesser degree, by the way the members of this group behave. In that sense, because it manifests itself in behaviour, it is less immediately visible than a person’s race. But, unlike a person’s religion or political opinion, it is incapable of being changed. To pretend that it does not exist, or that the behaviour by which it manifests itself can be suppressed, is to deny the members of this group their fundamental right to be what they are – of the right to do simple, everyday things with others of the same orientation such as living or spending time together or expressing their affection for each other in public.	HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	53. Heterosexuals have known this about themselves and been able to fulfil themselves in this way throughout history. Homosexuals have also known this about themselves but were long denied the possibility of fulfilling themselves through relationships with others. This was an affront to their dignity as human beings which our law has now (some would say belatedly) recognised. Homosexuals can enjoy the same freedom and the same relationships as any others. But we should not underestimate the continuing legacy of those centuries of discrimination, persecution even, which is still going on in many parts of the world. It is no doubt for that reason that Strasbourg requires “very weighty reasons” to justify discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. It is for that reason that we should be slow to accept that prohibiting hotel keepers from discriminating against homosexuals is a disproportionate limitation on their right to manifest their religion.	Bull and another v Hall and another	16. On 26 February 2016 the Appeal Court of the High Court of Justiciary (the Lord Justice General (Lord Carloway), Lady Dorrian and Lord Bracadale) issued their opinion on the reference. In that opinion the court rejected the appellant’s submission that the prohibition on raising the reasonable belief defence created a presumption of guilt and held that, absent any relevant complaint of procedural unfairness, the appellant was not within the ambit of article 6 of the ECHR. The court held that the appellant’s decision as an adult to engage in sexual activity with a child under the age of 16 did not engage the protection of article 8 of the ECHR. It held that, even if article 8 were engaged, the interference was both in accordance with the law and proportionate. The court stated (para 25):	AB v Her Majestys Advocate	40. In addressing this question, I acknowledge that the Scottish Parliament might have chosen to make sexual activity with older children a strict liability offence by excluding altogether the reasonable belief defence. But it did not. Instead, it chose to use as a limit on the defence the prior police charge of a relevant sexual offence, thereby bringing the limitation in the impugned provision within the ambit of article 8.	AB v Her Majestys Advocate	76. The New Zealand Refugee Status Appeals Authority observed in Re GJ [1998] (1995) INLR 387, 420 that “sexual orientation is either an innate or unchangeable characteristic or a characteristic so fundamental to identity or human dignity that it ought not be required to be changed” (emphasis in the original). So, starting from that position, the Convention offers protection to gay and lesbian people – and, I would add, bisexuals and everyone else on a broad spectrum of sexual behaviour - because they are entitled to have the same freedom from fear of persecution as their straight counterparts. No-one would proceed on the basis that a straight man or woman could find it reasonably tolerable to conceal his or her sexual identity indefinitely to avoid suffering persecution. Nor would anyone proceed on the basis that a man or woman could find it reasonably tolerable to conceal his or her race indefinitely to avoid suffering persecution. Such an assumption about gay men and lesbian women is equally unacceptable. Most significantly, it is unacceptable as being inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the Convention since it involves the applicant denying or hiding precisely the innate characteristic which forms the basis of his claim of persecution: Atta Fosu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2008 FC 1135, para 17, per Zinn J.	HJ Iran v Secretary of State for the Home Department and one other action	3. That was as far as EU law required, and still requires, it to go. But Parliament then passed the Equality Act 2006 . This established the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) and extended the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion or belief into, among other things, the provision of goods, facilities and services. It also permitted the Secretary of State to make regulations similarly extending the scope of the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2007, with which this case is concerned, were the result. All of this legislation has since been replaced (for a case such as this) by the Equality Act 2010 , but the principles, concepts and provisions with which we are concerned have remained much the same.
