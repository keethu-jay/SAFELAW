UKSC	Majority	AEL v Flight Centre UK Ltd.xml	Beginning	Judgment approved by the court for a hand downAEL v Flight Centre (UK) Ltd	The Respondent, did not appear and was not represented	The Employment Tribunal erred in failing to consider the application for reconsideration of the correct application for anonymity which the Appellant had made. The Appellant had made two relevant applications for anonymity – the first, dated 14 July 2021, was rejected by the Tribunal in a judgment dated 26 July 2021. The Appellant then made a further application on 4 August 2021 supported by a disability impact statement and medical records. That application was considered by the ET on 9 September 2021, by which point the Appellants claims against her former employer had been compromised. The 4 August 2021 application was rejected by the Tribunal under the terms of a decision issued on 9 September 2021. The Appellant applied for reconsideration of that decision on 17 September 2021. However, when that application was considered by the Tribunal under the terms of a decision issued on 21 March 2022, it was treated not as an application in respect of the decision issued on 9 September 2021 but as one made by reference to the earlier decision of 26 July 2021. To that extent therefore, it appeared that the ET had fallen into error	0.5339	(A Alston  Ors v The Doctors Laboratory Limited  Ors)	0.4602, 0.3931, 0.3628, 0.3484, 0.3463, 0.3445, 0.3367, 0.3322, 0.3310, 0.3303	0.4603	0.4176

UKSC	Dissenting	A Reference by the Attorney General for Northern Ireland of devolution issues to the Supreme Court pursuant to Paragraph 34 of Schedule 10 to the Northern Ireland Act 1998 Northern Ireland.xml	Middle	The Attorney General submits that a devolution issue arises because the provision of lists by the Department for Communities is necessary in order to give effect to the Secretary of State's commencement orders. The Department refutes this, contending that its role in issuing the relevant lists amounts to nothing more than providing administrative support to the Secretary of State. The commencement orders define the relevant territories by reference to lists of postcodes issued by the Department. The lists were not prepared, however, pursuant to any statutory or other power and do not have any independent legal force or effect, the Department says. They are incorporated by reference into the commencement orders and therefore have legal effects solely by reason of the act of the Secretary of State, not the act of the Department.	6. Acts by the Secretary of State or by departments in Westminster do not come within the purview of section 24 of the 1998 Act. In order for a devolution issue to arise, therefore, it must be shown that an act has been carried out or a function has been discharged by a Northern Ireland Minister or a Northern Ireland department.

The contrary view is that the provision of postcodes was indispensable to the effective introduction of the welfare reforms. Without them, the commencement orders could not operate. Conceivably, they could have been compiled by a Westminster department which would have rendered the act of preparing the lists immune from challenge as a devolution issue. But, in fact, they were not. A Northern Ireland department prepared the lists. Their existence was integral to the operation of the welfare reforms.

It is, I believe, important to recognise that the distinct prohibitions in section 24 are disjunctive. Thus, it is forbidden to make, confirm or approve any subordinate legislation, orto do any act, so far as the legislation or act is incompatible with any of the Convention rights. The section comprehends, therefore, not only the enactment of subordinate legislation but also acts which may be ancillary or even incidental to that enactment. On a theoretical or technical level, therefore, the compiling of lists of postcodes and providing them as a means of facilitating the introduction of the commencement orders is an act or the discharge of a function under paragraph 1(b) of Schedule 10 to the 1998 Act.	0.4917	(R on the application of Munir and another v Secretary of State for the Home Department)	0.4901, 0.4249, 0.4060, 0.3778, 0.3764, 0.3718, 0.3706, 0.3702, 0.3686, 0.3677	0.4191	0.3698

However, it appears that the emails showed that Mrs Gregory had first proposed to meet in early December, but later put forward revised dates, and, specifically, proposed 13 December in an email of 10 December.  The claimant then complained of that to Ms Saunders.  She then emailed him on 12 December informing him that Mrs Gregory would not be involved in line managing him until the grievance was resolved, and also asked him to provide suitable dates for a meeting with Ludlow Johnson (who was to investigate the grievance).

This time the judge's reasoning was that this was a matter for the fulltribunal, i.e. with judge and lay members, and that it would not be appropriate for him to deal with the matter in advance, sitting alone:   ""25. The order sought at paragraph 14 envisages that I make a ruling, by myself, as a process of case management, on what findings of fact contained in the Tayler judgment, as remitted, are binding on a tribunal which hears that remitted claim. Such a ruling would fundamentally affect the rights of both parties to rely on findings of fact. It is common ground that at least some of the findings of fact are binding. To the extent that there is a dispute, it concerns which findings of fact are binding, and which are not. 26. To resolve what facts remain binding, it is necessary, first, to finally determine what matters have been remitted. Whilst I have sought, at some length, to assist the parties with this, and whilst I have set out my understanding, that provisional ruling remains subject to any submissions by the parties. The determination of the scope of remission is for the tribunal that hears the remitted claim. It is for that tribunal, as a tribunal, to determine what claims have been remitted. When that process has been undertaken, it will be necessary for the tribunal to understand, having regard to the reason for remission, what effect it has, if any, on all or any of the findings of fact of the Tayler tribunal. Put simply, the tribunal that hears the remitted claim must decide which of the findings of fact are disturbed, and which are not. 27. It is possible that all of the findings of fact remain binding. I have previously noted that the remission appears to revolve around matters treated as facts by the Tayler tribunal, but for which there was no evidence, or at least there was a failure to properly identify the contention that stereotypes exist and put the contention to any witness. It appears the EAT found that the Tayler tribunal either directly relied on those erroneous facts or drew impermissible secondary inferences. However, none of that, necessarily, undermines the findings of fact made by the Tayler Tribunal legitimately based on the evidence presented. … 30. I have considered whether determining what facts are binding could be some form of the preliminary issue. I find that preliminary issues can incorporate matters of evidence and findings of fact. For example, there may be a dispute as to whether certain evidence is admissible. It may be appropriate for a ruling on admissibility to be made prior to a hearing. The effect may be, ultimately, to determine the claim. That would be a preliminary issue. 31. Specific discrete facts are often found by way preliminary issue, for example, the date of dismissal. Whilst those facts may be disputed, they can be resolved at a preliminary hearing, by way of a preliminary issue, by a judge sitting alone. However, the more ingrained the disputed facts are with the issues in the case, the less suitable is the matter for resolution as a preliminary issue. In this case, what facts remain binding at the remitted hearing cannot be excised, as some form of preliminary issue, from the main determination of the claim. What facts remain binding is fundamental to the resolution of this claim and should not be dealt with as a preliminary issue. 32. It follows from what I have said that the order sought at paragraph 14 of the application is not one which can be determined as a matter of case management, and it is not one which should be determined as a preliminary issue. It must be determined by the final tribunal."""

Whilst passages in those judgments to which my attention was drawn support the submission that, in those cases, a direction that there be a fresh hearing meant starting the hearing from scratch, I do not consider that any general rule can be laid down that, whenever the term ""fresh hearings"" is used, it must have that effect.  Each case will depend on its own facts and on the specific terms of the EAT's judgment.  But, as I have said, in this case the terms of the judgment and the order are clear that the direction that there be a fresh re-hearing meant that the tribunal hearing the remitted matter would have to start from scratch."	0.6265	0.3981	0.3213
